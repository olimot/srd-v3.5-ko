id="h3-1-telekinesis"><h3>염동력</h3><p>Transmutation</p><p><strong>레벨:</strong> Sor/Wiz 5</p><p><strong>구성요소:</strong> V, S</p><p><strong>시전 시간:</strong> 1 standard action</p><p><strong>거리:</strong> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</p><p><strong>목표물(들):</strong> See text</p><p><strong>지속시간:</strong> Concentration (up to 1 round/ level) or instantaneous; see text</p><p><strong>내성 굴림:</strong> Will negates (object) or None; see text</p><p><strong>주문 저항:</strong> Yes (object); see text</p><p>You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.</p><p><em>지속되는 힘:</em> A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.</p><p>This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.</p><p>An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require Intelligence checks.</p><p><em>전투 기동:</em> Alternatively, once per round, you can use <i>telekinesis</i> to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don’t provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn’t allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as for disarm or trip). No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.</p><p><em>난폭하게 던지기:</em> Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).</p><p>You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).</p><p>Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).</p></section><section id="h3-2-telekinetic-sphere"><h3>염동력의 구</h3><p>Evocation [Force]</p><p><strong>레벨:</strong> Sor/Wiz 8</p><p><strong>구성요소:</strong> V, S, M</p><p><strong>시전 시간:</strong> 1 standard action</p><p><strong>거리:</strong> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><strong>효과:</strong> 1-ft.-diameter/level sphere, centered around creatures or objects</p><p><strong>지속시간:</strong> 1 min./level (D)</p><p><strong>내성 굴림:</strong> Reflex negates (object)</p><p><strong>주문 저항:</strong> Yes (object)</p><p>This spell functions like <i>resilient sphere,</i> with the addition that the creatures or objects inside the globe are nearly weightless. Anything contained within an <i>telekinetic sphere</i> weighs only one-sixteenth of its normal weight. You can telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that normally weighs 5,000 pounds or less. The telekinetic control extends from you out to medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) after the sphere has succeeded in encapsulating its contents.</p><p>You can move objects or creatures in the sphere that weigh a total of 5,000 pounds or less by concentrating on the sphere. You can begin moving a sphere in the round after casting the spell. If you concentrate on doing so (a standard action), you can move the sphere as much as 30 feet in a round. If you cease concentrating, the sphere does not move in that round (if on a level surface) or descends at its falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a level surface, or the spell’s duration expires, or you begin concentrating again. If you cease concentrating (voluntarily or due to failing a Concentration check), you can resume concentrating on your next turn or any later turn during the spell’s duration.</p><p>The sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to cause damage to the contents of the sphere.</p><p>You can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it.</p><p><em>물질 요소:</em> A hemispherical piece of clear crystal, a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic, and a pair of small bar magnets.</p></section><section id="h3-3-telepathic-bond"><h3>텔레파시 결속</h3><p>Divination</p><p><strong>레벨:</strong> Sor/Wiz 5</p><p><strong>구성요소:</strong> V, S, M</p><p><strong>시전 시간:</strong> 1 standard action</p><p><strong>거리:</strong> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><strong>목표물:</strong> You plus one willing creature per three levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p><p><strong>지속시간:</strong> 10 min./level (D)</p><p><strong>내성 굴림:</strong> None</p><p><strong>주문 저항:</strong> No</p><p>You forge a telepathic bond among yourself and a number of willing creatures, each of which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. Each creature included in the link is linked to all the others. The creatures can communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another).</p><p>If desired, you may leave yourself out of the telepathic bond forged. This decision must be made at the time of casting.</p><p><i>Telepathic bond</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell, though it only bonds two creatures per casting of <i>permanency</i>.</p><p><em>물질 요소:</em> Pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures.</p></section><section id="h3-4-teleport"><h3>순간이동</h3><p>Conjuration (Teleportation)</p><p><strong>레벨:</strong> Sor/Wiz 5, Travel 5</p><p><strong>구성요소:</strong> V</p><p><strong>시전 시간:</strong> 1 standard action</p><p><strong>거리:</strong> Personal and touch</p><p><strong>목표물:</strong> You and touched objects or other touched willing creatures</p><p><strong>지속시간:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p><strong>내성 굴림:</strong> None and Will negates (object)</p><p><strong>주문 저항:</strong> No and Yes (object)</p><p>This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.</p><p>You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.</p><p>To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.</p><p><em>친숙함:</em> “Very familiar” is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you’ve been there often, or you have used other means (such as <i>scrying</i>) to study the place for at least one hour. “Seen casually” is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic. </p><p>“False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.</p><p><em>목표에 정확히 옴:</em> You appear where you want to be.</p><p><em>목표에서 벗어남:</em> You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly</p><p><em>비슷한 지역:</em> You wind up in an area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area.</p><p>Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails instead.</p><p><em>불발:</em> You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.</p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><th>친숙함</th><th>목표에 정확히 옴</th><th>목표에서 벗어남</th><th>비슷한 지역</th><th>불발</th></tr><tr><td>Very 패밀리어</td><td>01–97</td><td>98–99</td><td>100</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Studied carefully</td><td>01–94</td><td>95–97</td><td>98–99</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Seen casually</td><td>01–88</td><td>89–94</td><td>95–98</td><td>99–100</td></tr><tr><td>Viewed once</td><td>01–76</td><td>77–88</td><td>89–96</td><td>97–100</td></tr><tr><td>False destination (1d20+80)</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>81–92</td><td>93–100</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id="h3-5-teleport-object"><h3>물체 순간이동</h3><p>Conjuration (Teleportation)</p><p><strong>레벨:</strong> Sor/Wiz 7</p><p><strong>거리:</strong> Touch</p><p><strong>목표물:</strong> One touched object of up to 50 lb./level and 3 cu. ft./level</p><p><strong>내성 굴림:</strong> Will negates (object)</p><p><strong>주문 저항:</strong> Yes (object)</p><p>This spell functions like <i>teleport,</i> except that it teleports an object, not you.

In addition, you need not have seen the destination, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of the place to which you are teleporting. If you attempt to teleport with insufficient information (or with misleading information), you disappear and simply reappear in your original location.

Once you designate the destination for the circle, you can’t change it. The spell fails if you attempt to set the circle to teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place with which you are not familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane.</p><p>The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If you intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, you need to mark the circle in some way.</p><p><i>Teleportation circle</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent <i>teleportation circle</i> that is disabled becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.</p><p><em>비고:</em> Magic traps such as <i>teleportation circle</i> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the circle and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 34 in the case of <i>teleportation circle</i>.</p><p><em>물질 요소:</em> Amber dust to cover the area of the circle (cost 1,000 gp).</p></section><section id="h3-8-temporal-stasis"><h3>시간 동결</h3><p>Transmutation</p><p><strong>레벨:</strong> Sor/Wiz 8</p><p><strong>구성요소:</strong> V, S, M</p><p><strong>시전 시간:</strong> 1 standard action</p><p><strong>거리:</strong> Touch</p><p><strong>목표물:</strong> Creature touched</p><p><strong>지속시간:</strong> Permanent</p><p><strong>내성 굴림:</strong> Fortitude negates</p><p><strong>주문 저항:</strong> Yes</p><p>You must succeed on a melee touch attack.

The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices.

Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an Armor Class of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.)</p><p>You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.</p><p>Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.</p><p>Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a <i>wall of thorns</i> at normal speed without taking damage.</p><p>A <i>wall of thorns</i> can be breached by slow work with edged weapons.

You may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish, depositing the hapless souls wherever the cyclone happens to be when they are released.</p></section><section id="h3-51-whispering-wind"><h3>바람의 속삭임</h3><p>Transmutation [Air]</p><p><strong>레벨:</strong> Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 2</p><p><strong>구성요소:</strong> V, S</p><p><strong>시전 시간:</strong> 1 standard action</p><p><strong>거리:</strong> 1 mile/level</p><p><strong>범위:</strong> 10-ft.-radius spread</p><p><strong>지속시간:</strong> No more than 1 hour/level or until discharged (destination is reached)</p><p><strong>내성 굴림:</strong> None</p><p><strong>주문 저항:</strong> No</p><p>You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The <i>whispering wind</i> travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A <i>whispering wind</i> is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.</p><p>You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the <i>whispering wind</i> seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the <i>whispering wind</i> to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.</p><p>When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered. As with <i>magic mouth, whispering wind</i> cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.</p></section><section id="h3-52-wind-walk"><h3>바람 보행</h3><p>Transmutation [Air]</p><p><strong>레벨:</strong> Clr 6, Drd 7</p><p><strong>구성요소:</strong> V, S, DF</p><p><strong>시전 시간:</strong> 1 standard action</p><p><strong>거리:</strong> Touch</p><p><strong>목표물:</strong> You and one touched creature per three levels</p><p><strong>지속시간:</strong> 1 hour/level (D); see text</p><p><strong>내성 굴림:</strong> No and Will negates (harmless)</p><p><strong>주문 저항:</strong> No and Yes (harmless)</p><p>You alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor (as the <i>gaseous form</i> spell) and move through the air, possibly at great speed. You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently.</p><p>Normally, a <i>wind walker</i> flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a <i>wind walker</i> along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability. <i>Wind walkers</i> are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.</p><p>A <i>wind walker</i> can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as does any time spent in physical form). As noted above, you can dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others.</p><p>For the last minute of the spell’s duration, a <i>wind walker</i> in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end.</p></section><section id="h3-53-wind-wall"><h3>바람 장벽</h3><p>Evocation [Air]</p><p><strong>레벨:</strong> Air 2, Clr 3, Drd 3, Rgr 2, Sor/Wiz 3</p><p><strong>구성요소:</strong> V, S, M/DF</p><p><strong>시전 시간:</strong> 1 standard action</p><p><strong>거리:</strong> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p><p><strong>효과:</strong> Wall up to 10 ft./level long and 5 ft./level high (S)</p><p><strong>지속시간:</strong> 1 round/level</p><p><strong>내성 굴림:</strong> None; see text</p><p><strong>주문 저항:</strong> Yes</p><p>An invisible vertical curtain of wind appears.

Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a <i>wind wall.</i> Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall has a 30% miss chance.

Two to five <i>wish</i> spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. <i>Note:</i> An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.</p><p><span style="font-size: 16px;">• </span>Remove injuries and afflictions. A single <i>wish</i> can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same <i>wish</i>. A <i>wish</i> can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.</p><p><span style="font-size: 16px;">• </span>Revive the dead. A <i>wish</i> can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a <i>resurrection</i> spell. A <i>wish</i> can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two <i>wishes,</i> one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A <i>wish</i> cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level.</p><p><span style="font-size: 16px;">• </span>Transport travelers. A <i>wish</i> can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.</p><p><span style="font-size: 16px;">• </span>Undo misfortune. A <i>wish</i> can undo a single recent event. The <i>wish</i> forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <i>wish</i> could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend’s failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.</p><p>You may try to use a <i>wish</i> to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. (The <i>wish</i> may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.)</p><p>Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells).</p><p><em>물질 요소:</em> When a <i>wish</i> duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component.</p><p><em>XP 비용:</em> The minimum XP cost for casting <i>wish</i> is 5,000 XP. When a <i>wish</i> duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is more. When a <i>wish</i> creates or improves a magic item, you must pay twice the normal XP cost for crafting or improving the item, plus an additional 5,000 XP.</p></section><section id="h3-55-wood-shape"><h3>목재 조형</h3><p>Transmutation</p><p><strong>레벨:</strong> Drd 2</p><p><strong>구성요소:</strong> V, S, DF</p><p><strong>시전 시간:</strong> 1 standard action</p><p><strong>거리:</strong> Touch</p><p><strong>목표물:</strong> One touched piece of wood no larger than 10 cu. ft. + 1 cu. ft./level</p><p><strong>지속시간:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p><strong>내성 굴림:</strong> Will negates (object)</p><p><strong>주문 저항:</strong> Yes (object)</p><p><i>Wood shape</i> enables you to form one existing piece of wood into any shape that suits your purpose.

Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don’t provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn’t allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as for disarm or trip). No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally.

You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.

Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you.
