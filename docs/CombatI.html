        <div class="original-headline">HOW COMBAT WORKS</div>
        <p>전투 I cyclical; everybody acts in turn in a regular cycle of rounds. 전투 follows this sequence:</p>
        <p>1. Each combatant starts out flat-footed. Once a combatant acts, he or she is no longer flat-footed.</p>
        <p>
          2. Determine which characters are aware of their opponents at the start of the battle. If some but not all of
          the combatants are aware of their opponents, a 기습 round happens before regular rounds of 전투 begin. The
          combatants who are aware of the opponents can act in 기습 round, so they roll for 선제권. In 선제권 order
          (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of their opponents each take one action (either a
          standard action or a 이동 action) during 기습 round. Combatants who were unaware do not get to act in the 기습
          round. If no one or everyone starts the battle aware, there is no 기습 round.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Combatants who have not yet rolled 선제권 do so. All combatants are now 준비 to begin their first regular
          round of 전투.
        </p>
        <p>4. Combatants act in 선제권 order (highest to lowest).</p>
        <p>
          5. When everyone has had a turn, the combatant with the highest 선제권 acts again, and steps 4 and 5 repeat
          until 전투 ends.

          <h3>명중 굴림</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">ATTACK ROLL</div>
          <p>
            An 명중 굴림 represents your attempt to strike your opponent on your turn in a round. When you make an 명중
            굴림, you roll a d20 and add your 공격 보너스. (Other 수정치 may also apply to this roll.) If your result
            equals or beats the target의 방어도, you hit and deal 피해.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Automatic Misses and Hits:</b><span>
              A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on an 명중 굴림 is always a miss. A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is
              always a hit. A natural 20 is also a threat—a possible critical hit.</span>

          <h3>피해</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">DAMAGE</div>
          <p>
            When your 공격 succeeds, you deal 피해. The type of weapon used determines the amount of 피해 you deal.
            Effects that modify weapon 피해 apply to unarmed strikes and the natural physical 공격 forms of creatures.
          </p>
          <p>피해 reduces a target의 current 히트 포인트.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Minimum 피해:</b><span> If 페널티 reduce 피해 result to less than 1, a hit still deals 1 point of 피해.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            근력 보너스: When you hit with a melee or thrown weapon, including a 무릿매, add your 근력 수정치 to the
            피해 result. A 근력 페널티, but not 보너스, applies on 공격 made with a bow that is not a 합성궁.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>주로 쓰지 않는 손에 들린 무기: </i><span>When you deal 피해 with a weapon in your off hand, you add only 1/2 your 근력 보너스.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Wielding a Weapon Two-Handed: </i><span>When you deal 피해 with a weapon that you are wielding two-handed, you add 1-1/2 times your 근력 보너스.
              However, you don’t get this higher 근력 보너스 when using a 경량 무기 with two hands.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>곱하기 피해:</b><span>
              Sometimes you multiply 피해 by some factor, such as on a critical hit. Roll 피해(with all 수정치) multiple
              times and total the results. <i>Note: </i>When you multiply 피해 more
              than once, each multiplier works off the original, unmultiplied 피해.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Exception: </i><span>Extra 피해 주사위 over and above a weapon의 normal 피해 are never multiplied.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Ability 피해:</b><span>
              Certain creatures and magical effects can cause temporary ability 피해(a reduction to an ability
              score).</span>
          </p>

        <section id="h3-6-armor-class">
          <h3>방어도</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">ARMOR CLASS</div>
          <p>
            Your 방어도(AC) represents how hard it is for opponents to land a solid, damaging blow on you. It의 the 명중
            굴림 result that an opponent needs to achieve to hit you. Your AC is equal to the following: 10 + 갑옷
            보너스 + 방패 보너스 + 민첩 수정치 + size 수정치
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that 갑옷 limits your 민첩 보너스, so if you’re wearing 갑옷, you might not be able to apply your whole
            민첩 보너스 to your AC.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes you can’t use your 민첩 보너스(if you have one). If you can’t react to a blow, you can’t use your
            민첩 보너스 to AC. (If you don’t have a 민첩 보너스, nothing happens.)
          </p>
          <p>Other 수정치: Many other factors modify your AC.</p>
          <p>
            <i>Enhancement 보너스: </i><span>Enhancement effects make your 갑옷 better.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Deflection 보너스: </i><span>Magical deflection effects ward off 공격 and improve your AC.</span>
          </p>
          <p><i>자연 갑옷: </i><span>자연 갑옷 improves your AC.</span></p>
          <p>
            <i>회피 보너스: </i><span>Some other AC 보너스 represent actively avoiding blows. These 보너스 are called 회피 보너스. Any
              situation that denies you your 민첩 보너스 also denies you 회피 보너스. (Wearing 갑옷, however, does not
              limit these 보너스 the way it limits a 민첩 보너스 to AC.) Unlike most sorts of 보너스, 회피 보너스 stack

              Some 공격 disregard 갑옷, including 방패 and 자연 갑옷. In these cases, the attacker makes a touch 명중
              굴림(either ranged or melee). When you are the target of a touch 공격, your AC doesn’t include any 갑옷
              보너스, 방패 보너스, or 자연 갑옷 보너스. All other 수정치, such as your size 수정치, 민첩 수정치, and

          </p>
          <p>
            If you use two 이동 행동 in a round (sometimes called a “double 이동” action), you can 이동 up to double

          <p>
            Generally, when you are subject to an unusual or magical 공격, you get a 내성 굴림 to avoid or reduce the
            effect. Like an 명중 굴림, a 내성 굴림 is a d20 roll plus 보너스 based on your class, 레벨, and an ability
            score. Your 내성 굴림 수정치 is: Base save 보너스 + ability 수정치
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>내성 굴림 Types:</b><span> The three different kinds of 내성 굴림 are Fortitude, Reflex, and Will:</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Fortitude: </i><span>These 내성 굴림 measure your ability to 일어서기 to physical punishment or 공격 against your vitality and
              health. Apply your 건강 수정치 to your Fortitude 내성 굴림.

          <b>선제권 Checks:</b><span>
            At the start of a battle, each combatant makes an 선제권 check. An 선제권 check is a 민첩 check. Each
            character applies his or her 민첩 수정치 to the roll. Characters act in order, counting down from highest
            result to lowest. In every round that follows, the characters act in the same order (unless a character
            takes an action that results in his or her 선제권 changing; see 특수 선제권 행동).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          If two or more combatants have the same 선제권 check result, the combatants who are tied act in order of total
          선제권 수정치 (highest first). If there is still a tie, the tied characters should roll again to determine
          which one of them goes before the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Flat-Footed:</b><span>
            At the start of a battle, before you have had a chance to act (specifically, before your first regular turn
            in 선제권 order), you are flat-footed. You can’t use your 민첩 보너스 to AC (if any) while flat-footed.
            바바리안 and 도적 have the 기묘한 회피 extraordinary ability, which allows them to avoid losing their 민첩
            보너스 to AC due to being flat-footed.</span>

          <p>Determining Awareness</p>
          <p>
            Sometimes all the combatants on a side are aware of their opponents, sometimes none are, and sometimes only
            some of them are. Sometimes a few combatants on each side are aware and the other combatants on each side
            are unaware.

              If some but not all of the combatants are aware of their opponents, a 기습 round happens before regular
              rounds begin. Any combatants aware of the opponents can act in 기습 round, so they roll for 선제권. In
              선제권 order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of their opponents each take a
              standard action during 기습 round. You can also take 자유 행동 during 기습 round. If no one or everyone is

              Combatants who are unaware at the start of battle don’t get to act in 기습 round. Unaware combatants are

        <div class="original-headline">ATTACKS OF OPPORTUNITY</div>
        <p>
          Sometimes a combatant in a melee lets her guard down. In this case, combatants near her can take advantage of
          her lapse in defense to 공격 her for free. These free 공격 are called 기회 공격.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Threatened Squares:</b><span>
            You threaten all squares into which you can make a melee 공격, even when it is not your action. Generally,
            that means everything in all squares adjacent to your space (including diagonally). An enemy that takes
            certain actions while in a threatened square provokes an 공격 of opportunity from you. If you’re unarmed,
            you don’t normally threaten any squares and thus can’t make 기회 공격.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Reach 무기: </i><span>Most creatures of Medium or smaller size have a reach of only 5 feet. This means that they can make melee
            공격 only against creatures up to 5 feet (1 square) away. However, Small and Medium creatures wielding reach
            무기 threaten more squares than a typical creature. In addition, most creatures larger than Medium have a
            natural reach of 10 feet or more.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Provoking an 공격 of Opportunity: </b><span>Two kinds of actions can provoke 기회 공격: moving out of a threatened square and performing an action
            within a threatened square.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Moving: </i><span>Moving out of a threatened square usually provokes an 공격 of opportunity from the threatening opponent.
            There are two common methods of avoiding such an 공격—the 5-foot-step and 퇴각 action (see below).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Performing a Distracting Act: </i><span>Some actions, when performed in a threatened square, provoke 기회 공격 as you divert your attention from
            the battle. 표: 전투 내 행동 notes many of the actions that provoke 기회 공격.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Remember that even actions that normally provoke 기회 공격 may have exceptions to this rule.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Making an 공격 of Opportunity:</b><span>
            An 공격 of opportunity is a single melee 공격, and you can only make one per round. You don’t have to make
            an 공격 of opportunity if you don’t want to.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          An experienced character gets additional regular melee 공격(by using 전력 공격 action), but at a lower 공격
          보너스. You make your 공격 of opportunity, however, at your normal 공격 보너스—even if you’ve already attacked
          in the round.
        </p>
        <p>
          An 공격 of opportunity “interrupts” the normal flow of actions in the round. If an 공격 of opportunity is
          provoked, immediately resolve 공격 of opportunity, then continue with the next character의 turn (or complete
          the current turn, if 공격 of opportunity was provoked in the midst of a character의 turn).
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>전투 반사 and Additional 기회 공격: </i><span>If you have 전투 반사 feat you can add your 민첩 수정치 to the number of 기회 공격 you can make in a round.
            This feat does not let you make more than one 공격 for a given opportunity, but if the same opponent
            provokes two 기회 공격 from you, you could make two separate 기회 공격(since each one represents a different
            opportunity). Moving out of more than one square threatened by the same opponent in the same round doesn’t
            count as more than one opportunity for that opponent. All these 공격 are at your full normal 공격
            보너스.</span>

          <p>
            Each round represents 6 seconds in the game world. A round presents an opportunity for each character
            involved in a 전투 situation to take an action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each round의 activity begins with the character with the highest 선제권 result and then proceeds, in order,
            from there. Each round of a 전투 uses the same 선제권 order. When a character의 turn comes up in 선제권
            sequence, that character 공연 his entire round의 worth of actions. (For exceptions, see 기회 공격 and 특수
            선제권 행동.)
          </p>
          <p>
            For almost all 목적, there is no relevance to the end of a round or the beginning of a round. A round can be
            a segment of game time starting with the first character to act and ending with the last, but it usually
            means a span of time from one round to the same 선제권 count in the next round. Effects that last a certain
            number of rounds end just before the same 선제권 count that they began on.

        <section id="h3-15-action-types">
          <h3>행동 유형</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">ACTION TYPES</div>
          <p>
            An action의 type essentially tells you how long the action takes to 공연(within the framework of the
            6-second 전투 round) and how 이동 is treated. There are four types of actions: 표준 행동, 이동 행동, 전체
            라운드 행동, and 자유 행동.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a normal round, you can 공연 a standard action and a 이동 action, or you can 공연 a full-round action.
            You can also 공연 one or more 자유 행동. You can always take a 이동 action in place of a standard action.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some situations (such as in a 기습 round), you may be limited to taking only a single 이동 action or
            standard action.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Standard Action:</b><span>
              A standard action allows you to do something, most commonly make an 공격 or 주문 시전. See 표: 전투 내
              행동 for other 표준 행동.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>이동 Action:</b><span>
              A 이동 action allows you to 이동 your 속도 or 공연 an action that takes a similar amount of time. See 표:
              전투 내 행동.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can take a 이동 action in place of a standard action. If you 이동 no actual distance in a round
            (commonly because you have swapped your 이동 for one or more equivalent actions), you can take one 5-foot
            step either before, during, or after the action.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Full-Round Action:</b><span>
              A full-round action consumes all your effort during a round. The only 이동 you can take during a
              full-round action is a 5-foot step before, during, or after the action. You can also 공연 자유 행동(see
              below).</span>
          </p>
          <p>Some 전체 라운드 행동 do not allow you to take a 5-foot step.</p>
          <p>
            Some 전체 라운드 행동 can be taken as 표준 행동, but only in situations when you are limited to performing
            only a standard action during your round. 묘사 of specific actions, below, detail which actions allow this
            option.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Free Action:</b><span>
              자유 행동 consume a very small amount of time and effort. You can 공연 one or more 자유 행동 while taking
              another action normally. However, there are reasonable limits on what you can really do for free.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Not an Action:</b><span>
              Some activities are so minor that they are not even considered 자유 행동. They literally don’t take any
              time at all to do and are considered an inherent part of doing something else.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Restricted Activity:</b><span>
              In some situations, you may be unable to take a full round의 worth of actions. In such cases, you are
              restricted to taking only a single standard action or a single 이동 action (plus 자유 행동 as normal). You
              can’t take a full-round action (though you can start or complete a full-round action by using a standard
              action; see below).</span>

            <p>Making an 공격 is a standard action.</p>
            <p>
              <b>Melee 공격: </b><span>With a normal melee weapon, you can strike any opponent within 5 feet. (Opponents within 5 feet are
                considered adjacent to you.) Some melee 무기 have reach, as indicated in their 묘사. With a typical
                reach weapon, you can strike opponents 10 feet away, but you can’t strike adjacent foes (those within 5
                feet).</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Unarmed 공격:</b><span>
                Striking for 피해 with punches, kicks, and head butts is much like attacking with a melee weapon, except
                for the following:</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>기회 공격: </i><span>Attacking unarmed provokes an 공격 of opportunity from the character you 공격, provided she is armed.
                공격 of opportunity comes before your 공격. An unarmed 공격 does not provoke 기회 공격 from other foes
                nor does it provoke an 공격 of opportunity from an unarmed foe.</span>
            </p>
            <p>An unarmed character can’t take 기회 공격(but see “Armed” Unarmed 공격, below).</p>
            <p>
              <i>“Armed” Unarmed 공격: </i><span>Sometimes a character의 or creature의 unarmed 공격 counts as an armed 공격. A 수도사, a character with
                향상된 비무장 타격 feat, a spellcaster delivering a touch 공격 spell, and a creature with natural
                physical 무기 all count as being armed.</span>
            </p>
            <p>Note that being armed counts for both offense and defense (the character can make 기회 공격)</p>
            <p>
              <i>Unarmed Strike 피해: </i><span>An unarmed strike from a Medium character deals 1d3 points of 피해(plus your 근력 수정치, as normal). A
                Small character의 unarmed strike deals 1d2 points of 피해, while a Large character의 unarmed strike
                deals 1d4 points of 피해. All 피해 from unarmed strikes is 비치명적인 피해. Unarmed strikes count as 빛
                무기(for 목적 of two-weapon 공격 페널티 and so on).</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Dealing Lethal 피해: </i><span>You can specify that your unarmed strike will deal lethal 피해 before you make your 명중 굴림, but you
                take a –4 페널티 on your 명중 굴림. If you have 향상된 비무장 타격 feat, you can deal lethal 피해 with
                an unarmed strike without taking 페널티 on 명중 굴림.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Ranged 공격:</b><span>
                With a ranged weapon, you can shoot or throw at any target that is within the weapon의 maximum 거리 and
                in line of sight. The maximum 거리 for a thrown weapon is five 거리 increments. For projectile 무기, it
                is ten 거리 increments. Some ranged 무기 have shorter maximum 거리, as specified in their 묘사.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>명중 굴림:</b><span> An 명중 굴림 represents your attempts to strike your opponent. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Your 명중 굴림 is 1d20 + your 공격 보너스 with the weapon you’re using. If the result is at least as high
              as the target의 AC, you hit and deal 피해.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Automatic Misses and Hits:</b><span>
                A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on 명중 굴림 is always a miss. A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is
                always a hit. A natural 20 is also a threat—a possible critical hit.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>피해 Rolls:</b><span>
                If 명중 굴림 result equals or exceeds the target의 AC, 공격 hits and you deal 피해. Roll the appropriate
                피해 for your weapon. 피해 is deducted from the target의 current 히트 포인트.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Multiple 공격:</b><span>
                A character who can make more than one 공격 per round must use 전력 공격 action (see 전체 라운드 행동,
                below) in order to get more than one 공격.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Shooting or Throwing into a Melee:</b><span>
                If you shoot or throw a ranged weapon at a target engaged in melee with a friendly character, you take a
                –4 페널티 on your 명중 굴림. Two characters are engaged in melee if they are enemies of each other and
                either threatens the other. (An unconscious or otherwise immobilized character is not considered engaged
                unless he is actually being attacked.)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              If your target (or the part of your target you’re aiming at, if it의 a big target) is at least 10 feet
              away from the nearest friendly character, you can avoid the –4 페널티, even if the creature you’re aiming
              at is engaged in melee with a friendly character.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>정밀 사격: </i><span>If you have 정밀 사격 feat you don’t take this 페널티.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Fighting Defensively as a Standard Action:</b><span>
                You can choose to fight defensively when attacking. If you do so, you take a –4 페널티 on all 공격 in a
                round to gain a +2 회피 보너스 to AC for the same round.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Critical Hits:</b><span>
                When you make an 명중 굴림 and get a natural 20 (the d20 shows 20), you hit regardless of your target의
                방어도, and you have scored a threat. The hit might be a critical hit (or “crit”). To find out if it의 a
                critical hit, you immediately make a critical roll—another 명중 굴림 with all the same 수정치 as the
                명중 굴림 you just made. If the critical roll also results in a hit against the target의 AC, your
                original hit is a critical hit. (The critical roll just needs to hit to give you a crit. It doesn’t need
                to come up 20 again.) If the critical roll is a miss, then your hit is just a regular hit.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              A critical hit means that you roll your 피해 more than once, with all your usual 보너스, and add the rolls
              together. Unless otherwise specified, the threat 거리 for a critical hit on an 명중 굴림 is 20, and the
              multiplier is x2.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Exception:</i><span>Extra 피해 over and above a weapon의 normal 피해 is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Increased Threat 거리:</i><span>Sometimes your threat 거리 is 상급 than 20. That is, you can score a threat on a lower number. In such
                cases, a roll of lower than 20 is not an automatic hit. Any 명중 굴림 that doesn’t result in a hit is
                not a threat.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Increased Critical Multiplier:</i><span>Some 무기 deal better than double 피해 on a critical hit.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>주문 and Critical Hits: </i><span>A spell that requires an 공격 rollcan score a critical hit. A spell 공격 that requires no 공격
                rollcannot score a critical hit.</span>

            <h5>주문 시전</h5>
            <div class="original-headline">Cast a Spell</div>
            <p>
              Most 주문 require 1 standard action to cast. You can cast such a spell either before or after you take a
              이동 action.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Note: </i><span>You retain your 민첩 보너스 to AC while casting.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Spell 구성요소:</b><span>
                To 주문 시전 with a verbal (V) component, your character must 말하기 in a firm voice. If you’re gagged
                or in 범위 of a <i>침묵 </i>spell, you can’t cast such a spell. A
                spellcaster who has been deafened has a 20% chance to spoil any spell he tries to cast if that spell has
                a verbal component.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              To 주문 시전 with a somatic (S) component, you must gesture freely with at least one hand. You can’t 주문
              시전 of this type while bound, grappling, or with both your hands full or occupied.
            </p>
            <p>
              To 주문 시전 with a material (M), focus (F), or 신성 focus (DF) component, you have to have the proper
              materials, as described by the spell. Unless these materials are elaboratepreparing these materials is a
              free action. For material 구성요소 and focuses whose costs are not listed, you can assume that you have
              them if you have your spell component pouch.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some 주문 have an experience point (XP) component and entail an 경험치 비용 to you. No spell can restore
              the lost XP. You cannot spend so much XP that you lose a 레벨, so you cannot cast the spell unless you
              have enough XP to spare. However, you may, on gaining enough XP to achieve a new 레벨, immediately spend
              the XP on casting the spell rather than keeping it to advance a 레벨. The XP are expended when you cast
              the spell, whether or not the casting succeeds.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>집중:</b><span>
                You must concentrate to 주문 시전. If you can’t concentrate you can’t 주문 시전. If you start casting a
                spell but something interferes with your 집중 you must make a 집중 check or lose the spell. The check의
                DC depends on what is threatening your 집중(see 집중 skill). If you fail, the spell fizzles with no
                effect. If you prepare 주문, it is lost from preparation. If you cast at will, it counts against your
                daily limit of 주문 even though you did not cast it successfully.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Concentrating to Maintain a Spell:</b><span>
                Some 주문 require continued 집중 to keep them going. Concentrating to maintain a spell is a standard
                action that doesn’t provoke an 공격 of opportunity. Anything that could break your 집중 when casting a
                spell can keep you from concentrating to maintain a spell. If your 집중 breaks, the spell ends.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>시전 시간:</b><span>
                Most 주문 have a 시전 시간 of 1 standard action. A spell cast in this manner immediately takes
                effect.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>기회 공격:</b><span>
                Generally, if you 주문 시전, you provoke 기회 공격 from threatening enemies. If you take 피해 from an
                공격 of opportunity, you must make a 집중 check (DC 10 + points of 피해 taken + spell 레벨) or lose the
                spell. 주문 that require only a free action to cast don’t provoke 기회 공격.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Casting on the Defensive:</b><span>
                Casting a spell while on the defensive does not provoke an 공격 of opportunity. It does, however,
                require a 집중 check (DC 15 + spell 레벨) to pull off. Failure means that you lose the spell.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Touch 주문 in 전투:</b><span>
                Many 주문 have a 거리 of touch. To use these 주문, you cast the spell and then touch the subject, either
                in the same round or any time later. In the same round that you cast the spell, you may also touch (or
                attempt to touch) the target. You may take your 이동 before casting the spell, after touching the
                target, or between casting the spell and touching the target. You can automatically touch one friend or
                use the spell on yourself, but to touch an opponent, you must succeed on an 명중 굴림.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Touch 공격: </i><span>Touching an opponent with a touch spell is considered to be an armed 공격 and therefore does not
                provoke 기회 공격. However, the act of casting a spell does provoke an 공격 of opportunity. Touch 공격
                come in two types: melee touch 공격 and ranged touch 공격. You can score critical hits with either type
                of 공격. Your opponent의 AC against a touch 공격 does not include any 갑옷 보너스, 방패 보너스, or
                자연 갑옷 보너스. His size 수정치, 민첩 수정치, and deflection 보너스(if any) all apply
                normally.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Holding 돌격: </i><span>If you don’t discharge the spell in the round when you cast the spell, you can hold the discharge of
                the spell (hold 돌격) indefinitely. You can continue to make touch 공격 round after round. You can touch
                one friend as a standard action or up to six friends as a full-round action. If you touch anything or
                anyone while holding a 돌격, even unintentionally, the spell discharges. If you cast another spell, the
                touch spell dissipates. Alternatively, you may make a normal unarmed 공격(or an 공격 with a natural
                weapon) while holding a 돌격. In this case, you aren’t considered armed and you provoke 기회 공격 as
                normal for 공격. (If your unarmed 공격 or natural weapon 공격 doesn’t provoke 기회 공격, neither does
                this 공격.) If 공격 hits, you deal normal 피해 for your unarmed 공격 or natural weapon and the spell
                discharges. If 공격 misses, you are still holding 돌격.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Dismiss a Spell:</b><span> Dismissing an active spell is a standard action that doesn’t provoke 기회 공격.</span>

              Many 마법 아이템 don’t need to be activated. However, certain 마법 아이템 need to be activated, especially
              potions, 두루마리, 마법막대, 마법봉, and 마법지팡이. Activating a magic item is a standard action (unless
              the item 묘사 indicates otherwise).

            <p>
              <b>Spell Completion Items: </b><span>Activating a spell completion item is the equivalent of casting a spell. It requires 집중 and provokes
                기회 공격. You lose the spell if your 집중 is broken, and you can attempt to activate the item while on
                the defensive, as with casting a spell.</span>

              Using a special ability is usually a standard action, but whether it is a standard action, a full-round

                Using a 유사주문 ability works like casting a spell in that it requires 집중 and provokes 기회 공격.
                유사주문 능력 can be disrupted. If your 집중 is broken, the attempt to use the ability fails, but the
                attempt counts as if you had used the ability. 시전 시간 of a 유사주문 ability is 1 standard action,
                unless the ability 묘사 notes otherwise.</span>

              A spell that takes 1 round to cast is a full-round action. It comes into effect just before the beginning

              A spell that takes 1 minute to cast comes into effect just before your turn 1 minute later (and for each
              of those 10 rounds, you are casting a spell as a full-round action). These actions must be consecutive and
              uninterrupted, or the spell automatically fails.

            <p>
              When you begin a spell that takes 1 round or longer to cast, you must continue the invocations, gestures,
              and 집중 from one round to just before your turn in the next round (at least). If you lose 집중 after

              You only provoke 기회 공격 when you begin casting a spell, even though you might continue casting for at

                spell is a full-round action for a 소서러 or 음유시인. Note that this isn’t the same as a spell with a
                1-round 시전 시간—the spell takes effect in the same round that you begin casting, and you aren’t
                required to continue the invocations, gestures, and 집중 until your next turn. For 주문 with a longer

          Your 히트 포인트 measure how hard you are to kill. No matter how many 히트 포인트 you lose, your character

          <p>The most common way that your character gets hurt is to take lethal 피해 and lose 히트 포인트</p>
          <p>
            <b>What 히트 포인트 Represent:</b><span>
              히트 포인트 mean two things in the game world: the ability to take physical punishment and keep going, and
              the ability to turn a serious blow into a less serious one.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Effects of Hit Point 피해:</b><span>
              피해 doesn’t slow you down until your current 히트 포인트 reach 0 or lower. At 0 히트 포인트, you’re
              행동 불능.</span>
          </p>
          <p>At from –1 to –9 히트 포인트, you’re 죽어가고 있음.</p>
          <p>At –10 or lower, you’re 죽음.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Massive 피해: </b><span>If you ever sustain a single 공격 deals 50 points of 피해 or more and it doesn’t kill you outright, you
              must make a DC 15 Fortitude save. If this 내성 굴림 fails, you die regardless of your current 히트 포인트.
              If you take 50 points of 피해 or more from multiple 공격, no one of which dealt 50 or more points of 피해
              itself, the massive 피해 rule does not apply.</span>

          <p>When your current 히트 포인트 drop to exactly 0, you’re 행동 불능.</p>
          <p>
            You can only take a single 이동 or standard action each turn (but not both, nor can you take 전체 라운드
            행동). You can take 이동 행동 without further injuring yourself, but if you 공연 any standard action (or any
            other strenuous action) you take 1 point of 피해 after the completing the act. Unless your activity
            increased your 히트 포인트, you are now at –1 히트 포인트, and you’re 죽어가고 있음.

            roll d% to see whether 죽어가고 있음 character becomes stable. He has a 10% chance of becoming stable. If he
            doesn’t, he loses 1 hit point. (A character who의 unconscious or 죽어가고 있음 can’t use any special action
            that changes 선제권 count on which his action occurs.)

          <p>If the character의 히트 포인트 drop to –10 or lower, he의 죽음.</p>
          <p>
            You can keep a 죽어가고 있음 character from losing any more 히트 포인트 and make him stable with a DC 15

          </p>
          <p>
            If any sort of 치료 cures 죽어가고 있음 character of even 1 point of 피해, he stops losing 히트 포인트 and
            becomes stable.
          </p>
          <p>
            치료 that raises 죽어가고 있음 character의 히트 포인트 to 0 makes him conscious and 행동 불능. 치료 that
            raises his 히트 포인트 to 1 or more makes him fully functional again, just as if he’d never been reduced to
            0 or lower. A spellcaster retains the spellcasting capability she had before dropping below 0 히트 포인트.
          </p>
          <p>
            A stable character who has been tended by a healer or who has been magically healed eventually regains
            consciousness and recovers 히트 포인트 naturally. If the character has no one to tend him, however, his life
            is still in danger, and he may yet slip away.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Recovering with Help:</b><span>
              One hour after a tended, 죽어가고 있음 character becomes stable, roll d%. He has a 10% chance of becoming
              conscious, at which point he is 행동 불능(as if he had 0 히트 포인트). If he remains unconscious, he has
              the same chance to revive and become 행동 불능 every hour. Even if unconscious, he recovers 히트 포인트
              naturally. He is back to normal when his 히트 포인트 rise to 1 or higher.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Recovering without Help:</b><span>
              A severely wounded character left alone usually dies. He has a small chance, however, of recovering on his
              own.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            A character who becomes stable on his own (by making the 10% roll while 죽어가고 있음) and who has no one to
            tend to him still loses 히트 포인트, just at a slower rate. He has a 10% chance each hour of becoming
            conscious. Each time he misses his hourly roll to become conscious, he loses 1 hit point. He also does not
            recover 히트 포인트 through natural 치료.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even once he becomes conscious and is 행동 불능, an unaided character still does not recover 히트 포인트
            naturally. Instead, each day he has a 10% chance to start recovering 히트 포인트 naturally (starting with
            that day); otherwise, he loses 1 hit point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once an unaided character starts recovering 히트 포인트 naturally, he is no longer in danger of naturally
            losing 히트 포인트(even if his current hit point total is negative).
