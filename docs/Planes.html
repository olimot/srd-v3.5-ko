이세계 of existence are different realities with interwoven connections. Except
for rare linking points, each plane is effectively its own universe with its
own natural laws. </p><p>The 이세계
break down into a number of general types: 물질 세계, the Transitive
이세계, the Inner 이세계, the Outer 이세계, and the demiplanes.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Material
Plane: </span><span>물질 세계 tends to be the most Earthlike of all 이세계 and operates under
the same set of natural laws that our own real world does. This is the default
plane for most adventures.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Transitive
이세계:</span><span>
These three 이세계 have one important common characteristic: Each is used to
get from one place to another. 영적 세계 is a conduit to all other
이세계, while 에테리얼 세계 and the 어둠의 세계 both serve as means of
transportation within 물질 세계 they’re connected to. These 이세계
have the strongest regular interaction with 물질 세계 and are often
accessed by using various 주문. They have native inhabitants as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Inner
이세계:</span><span>
These six 이세계 are manifestations of the basic building blocks of the
universe. Each is made up of a single type of energy or element that overwhelms
all others. The natives of a particular Inner Plane are made of the same energy
or element as the plane itself.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Outer
이세계:</span><span>
The deities live on the Outer 이세계, as do creatures such as celestials,
데몬, and 악마. Each of the Outer 이세계 has an 성향, representing a
particular moral or ethical outlook, and the natives of each plane tend to behave
in agreement with that plane’s 성향. The Outer 이세계 are also the final
resting place of souls from 물질 세계, whether that final rest takes
the form of calm introspection or eternal 천벌.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Demiplanes:</span><span> This catch-all category
엄폐 all extradimensional spaces that function like 이세계 but have
measurable size and limited access. Other kinds of 이세계 are theoretically
infinite in size, but a demiplane might be only a few hundred feet across.</span></p></section><section id="h3-2-planar-traits"><h3>이세계 속성</h3><div class="original-headline">PLANAR TRAITS</div><p>Each
plane of existence has its own properties—the natural laws of its universe.</p><p>이세계 속성 are broken down into a number of general areas.</p><p>All
이세계 have the following kinds of traits.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">물리적 속성:</span><span>
These traits determine the laws of physics and nature on the plane, including
how gravity and time function.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">정령과 에너지 속성:</span><span> These traits determine the dominance of particular 정령
or energy forces.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">성향적 속성:</span><span>
Just as characters may be lawful neutral or chaotic good, many 이세계 are tied
to a particular moral or ethical outlook.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">마법적 속성:</span><span>
Magic works differently from plane to plane, and 마법적 속성 set the
boundaries for what it can and can’t do.</span></p></section><section id="h3-3-physical-traits"><h3>물리적 속성</h3><div class="original-headline">Physical
Traits</div><p>The
two most important natural laws set by 물리적 속성 are how gravity works
and how time passes. Other 물리적 속성 pertain to the size and shape of a
plane and how easily a plane’s nature can be altered.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Gravity:</span><span> The direction of
gravity’s pull may be unusual, and it might even change directions within the
plane itself.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Normal
Gravity: </span><span>Most
이세계 have gravity similar to that of 물질 세계. The usual rules for
능력 점수, 운반 수용량, and encumbrance apply. Unless otherwise
noted in a 묘사, it is assumed every plane has the normal gravity trait.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Heavy
Gravity: </span><span>The
gravity on a plane with this trait is much more intense than on 물질 세계. As a result, 균형, 등반, 도약, 탑승, 수영, and 재주넘기 checks incur a
–2 circumstance penalty, as do all 명중 굴림. All item weights are
effectively doubled, which might affect a character’s 속도. Weapon 범위 are
halved. A character’s 근력 and 민첩 scores are not affected.
Characters who fall on a heavy gravity plane take 1d10 points of 피해 for
each 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d10 points of 피해.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">빛
Gravity: </span><span>The
gravity on a plane with this trait is less intense than on 물질 세계.
As a result, creatures find that they can lift more, but their 이동 tend
to be ungainly. Characters on a plane with the 빛 gravity trait take a –2
circumstance penalty on 명중 굴림 and 균형, 탑승, 수영, and 재주넘기
checks. All items weigh half as much. Weapon 범위 double, and characters gain
a +2 circumstance bonus on 등반 and 도약 checks.</span></p><p>근력
and 민첩 don’t change as a result of 빛 gravity, but what you can do
with such scores does change. These advantages apply to travelers from other
이세계 as well as natives.</p><p>낙하
characters on a 빛 gravity plane take 1d4 points of 피해 for each 10 feet
of the fall (maximum 20d4).</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">No
Gravity: </span><span>Individuals
on a plane with this trait merely 부유 in space, unless other resources are
available to provide a direction for gravity’s pull.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Objective
Directional Gravity: </span><span>The 근력 of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same
as on 물질 세계, but the direction is not the traditional “down”
toward the ground. It may be down toward any solid object, at an angle to the
surface of the plane itself, or even upward.</span></p><p>In
addition, objective directional gravity may change from place to place. The
direction of “down” may vary.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Subjective
Directional Gravity: </span><span>The 근력 of gravity on a plane with this trait is the
same as on 물질 세계, but each individual chooses the direction of
gravity’s pull. Such a plane has no gravity for unattended objects and
nonsentient creatures. This sort of 환경 can be very disorienting to the
newcomer, but is common on “weightless” 이세계.</span></p><p>Characters
on a plane with subjective directional gravity can 이동 normally along a solid
surface by imagining “down” near their feet. If suspended in midair, a
character “flies” by merely choosing a “down” direction and “낙하” that way.
Under such a procedure, an individual “falls” 150 feet in the first round and
300 feet in each succeeding round. 이동 is straight-line only. In order to
stop, one has to 감속화 one’s 이동 by changing the designated “down”
direction (again, moving 150 feet in the new direction in the first round and
300 feet per round thereafter).</p><p>It
takes a DC 16 지혜 check to set a new direction of gravity as a free action;
this check can be made once per round. Any character who fails this 지혜
check in successive rounds receives a +6 bonus on subsequent checks until he or
she succeeds.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Time:</span><span> The rate of time’s passage
can vary on different 이세계, though it remains constant within any particular
plane. Time is always subjective for the viewer. The same subjectivity applies
to various 이세계. Travelers may discover that they’ll pick up or lose time
while moving among the 이세계, but from their point of view, time always passes
naturally.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Normal
Time: </span><span>This
trait describes the way time passes on 물질 세계. One hour on a plane
with normal time equals one hour on 물질 세계. Unless otherwise noted
in a 묘사, every plane has the normal time trait.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Timeless:
</span><span>On 이세계
with this trait, time still passes, but the effects of time are diminished. How
the timeless trait can affect certain activities or 상태이상 such as hunger,
thirst, aging, the effects of 독, and 치료 varies from plane to plane.</span></p><p>The
danger of a timeless plane is that once one leaves such a plane for one where
time flows normally, 상태이상 such as hunger and aging do occur
retroactively. </p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Flowing
Time: </span><span>On
some 이세계, time can flow faster or slower. One may travel to another plane,
spend a year there, then return to 물질 세계 to find that only six
seconds have elapsed. Everything on the plane returned to is only a few seconds
older. But for that traveler and the items, 주문, and effects working on him,
that year away was entirely real.</span></p><p>When
designating how time works on 이세계 with flowing time, put 물질 세계’s flow of time first, followed by the same flow in the other plane. </p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Erratic
Time: </span><span>Some
이세계 have time that 감속화 down and 속도 up, so an individual may lose or
gain time as he 이동 between the two 이세계. The following is provided as an
example.</span></p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 22.5001em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; text-align: center; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">d%</td><td style="width: 7.575em; border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Time

the denizens of such a plane, time flows naturally and the shift is unnoticed.</p><p>If
a plane is timeless with respect to magic, any spell cast with a
noninstantaneous 지속시간 is permanent until dispelled.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Shape
and Size:</span><span>
이세계 come in a variety of sizes and shapes. Most 이세계 are infinite, or at
least so large that they may as well be infinite.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Infinite:
</span><span>이세계
with this trait go on forever, though they may have finite 구성요소 within
them. Or they may consist of ongoing expanses in two directions, like a map
that stretches out infinitely.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Finite
Shape: </span><span>A
plane with this trait has defined edges or borders. These borders may adjoin
other 이세계 or hard, finite borders such as the edge of the world or a great
wall. Demiplanes are often finite.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Self-Contained
Shape: </span><span>On
이세계 with this trait, the borders wrap in on themselves, depositing the
traveler on the other side of the map. A spherical plane is an example of a
self-contained, finite plane, but there can be cubes, toruses, and flat 이세계
with magical edges that 순간이동 the traveler to an opposite edge when he
crosses them. </span></p><p>Some
demiplanes are self-contained.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Morphic
Traits:</span><span>
This trait measures how easily the basic nature of a plane can be changed. Some
이세계 are responsive to sentient thought, while others can be manipulated only
by extremely powerful creatures. And some 이세계 respond to physical or magical
efforts.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Alterable
Morphic: </span><span>On
a plane with this trait, objects remain where they are (and what they are)
unless affected by physical force or magic. You can change the immediate
환경 as a result of tangible effort. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Highly
Morphic: </span><span>On
a plane with this trait, features of the plane change so frequently that it’s
difficult to keep a particular area stable. Such 이세계 may react dramatically
to specific 주문, sentient thought, or the 의지의 힘. Others change for
no reason. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Magically
Morphic: </span><span>Specific
주문 can alter the basic material of a plane with this trait.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Divinely
Morphic: </span><span>Specific
unique beings (deities or similar great powers) have the ability to alter
objects, creatures, and the landscape on 이세계 with this trait. Ordinary
characters find these 이세계 similar to alterable 이세계 in that they may be
affected by 주문 and physical effort. But the deities may cause these areas
to change instantly and dramatically, creating great kingdoms for themselves. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Static:
</span><span>These
이세계 are unchanging. Visitors cannot affect living residents of the plane,
nor objects that the denizens possess. Any 주문 that would affect those on
the plane have no effect unless the plane’s static trait is somehow removed or
suppressed. 주문 cast before entering a plane with the static trait remain in
effect, however.</span></p><p>Even
moving an unattended object within a static plane requires a DC 16 근력
check. Particularly heavy objects may be impossible to 이동.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sentient:
</span><span>These
이세계 are ones that respond to a single thought— that of the plane itself.
Travelers would find the plane’s landscape changing as a result of what the
plane thought of the travelers, either becoming more or less hospitable
depending on its reaction.</span></p></section><section id="h3-4-elemental-and-energy-traits"><h3>정령과 에너지 속성</h3><div class="original-headline">Elemental and
Energy Traits</div><p>Four basic
elements and two types of energy together make up everything. The elements are
earth, air, fire, and water. The types of energy are positive and negative.</p><p>물질 세계 reflects a balancing of those elements and energies; all are found there.
Each of the Inner 이세계 is dominated by one element or type of energy. Other
이세계 may show off various aspects of these 정령 traits. Many 이세계 have
no 정령 or energy traits; these traits are noted in a plane’s 묘사
only when they are present.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Air-Dominant:</span><span> Mostly open space, 이세계
with this trait have just a few bits of floating stone or other elements. They
usually have a breathable atmosphere, though such a plane may include clouds of
acidic or toxic gas. Creatures of the earth subtype are uncomfortable on
air-dominant 이세계 because they have little or no natural earth to connect
with. They take no actual 피해, however.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Earth-Dominant:</span><span> 이세계 with this trait
are mostly solid. Travelers who arrive 달리기 the risk of 질식 if they
don’t reach a cavern or other pocket within the earth. Worse yet, individuals
without the ability to burrow are entombed in the earth and must dig their way
out (5 feet per turn). Creatures of the air subtype are uncomfortable on earth
dominant 이세계 because these 이세계 are tight and claustrophobic to them. But
they suffer no inconvenience beyond having difficulty moving.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Fire-Dominant:
</span><span>이세계
with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn without consuming
their fuel source. Fire-dominant 이세계 are extremely hostile to Material Plane
creatures, and those without 저항 or immunity to fire are soon immolated.</span></p><p>Unprotected
wood, paper, cloth, and other flammable materials catch fire almost
immediately, and those wearing unprotected flammable 의류 catch on fire. In
addition, individuals take 3d10 points of fire 피해 every round they are on a
fire-dominant plane. Creatures of the water subtype are extremely uncomfortable
on fire-dominant 이세계. Those that are made of water take double 피해 each
round.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Water-Dominant:</span><span> 이세계 with this trait
are mostly liquid. Visitors who can’t breathe water or reach a pocket of air
will likely drown. Creatures of the fire subtype are extremely uncomfortable on
water-dominant 이세계. Those made of fire take 1d10 points of 피해 each
round.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Positive-Dominant:
</span><span>An
abundance of life characterizes 이세계 with this trait. The two kinds of
positive-dominant traits are minor positive-dominant and major
positive-dominant. A minor positive-dominant plane is a riotous explosion of
life in all its forms. Colors are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are
louder, and sensations are more intense as a result of the positive energy
swirling through the plane. All individuals in a positive-dominant plane gain
빠른 치료 2 as an extraordinary ability.</span></p><p>Major
positive-dominant 이세계 go even further. A creature on a major
positive-dominant plane must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being blinded
for 10 rounds by the brilliance of the surroundings. Simply being on the plane
grants 빠른 치료 5 as an extraordinary ability. In addition, those at full
히트 포인트 gain 5 additional 임시 히트 포인트 per round. These 임시 히트 포인트 fade 1d20 rounds after the creature leaves the major positive-
dominant plane. However, a creature must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round
that its 임시 히트 포인트 exceed its normal hit point total. Failing the
내성 굴림 results in the creature exploding in a riot of energy, killing it.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Negative-Dominant:</span><span> 이세계 with this trait
are vast, empty reaches that suck the life out of travelers who cross them.
They tend to be lonely, haunted 이세계, drained of color and filled with 바람
bearing the soft moans of those who died within them. As with positive-dominant
이세계, negative-dominant 이세계 can be either minor or major. On minor
negative-dominant 이세계, living creatures take 1d6 points of 피해 per round.
At 0 히트 포인트 or lower, they crumble into ash.</span></p><p>Major

evident.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Good-Aligned/Evil-Aligned:

집중 of evil or good, law or chaos in places.</p><p>A
strongly neutral-aligned plane would stand in opposition to all other moral and
ethical principles: good, evil, law, and chaos. Such a plane may be more
concerned with the 균형 of the 성향 than with accommodating and
accepting alternate points of view. In the same fashion as for other strongly
aligned 이세계, strongly neutral-aligned 이세계 apply a –2 circumstance penalty
to 지능-, 지혜-, or 매력-based checks by any creature that isn’t
neutral. The penalty is applied twice (once for law/chaos, and once for good/evil),
so neutral good, neutral evil, lawful neutral, and chaotic neutral creatures
take a –2 penalty and lawful good, chaotic good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil
creatures take a –4 penalty.</p></section><section id="h3-6-magic-traits"><h3>마법적 속성</h3><div class="original-headline">Magic Traits</div><p>A plane’s magic

If a link between two 이세계 can be created at any point, the two 이세계 are

variety of planar 관문, natural vortices, paths, and shifting borders.</p><p>Access
to a layered plane from elsewhere usually happens on a specific layer: the
first layer of the plane, which can be either the top layer or the bottom
layer, depending on the specific plane. Most fixed access points (such as
portals and natural vortices) reach this layer, which makes it the gateway for
other layers of the plane. The <span style="font-style: italic;">이세계 전이 </span>spell also deposits the
