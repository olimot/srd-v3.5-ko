        <div class="original-headline">WHAT IS A PLANE?</div>
        <p>
          이세계 of existence are different realities with interwoven connections. Except for rare linking points,
          each plane is effectively its own universe with its own natural laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          이세계 break down into a number of general types: 물질 세계, the Transitive 이세계, the Inner 이세계, the
          Outer 이세계, and the demiplanes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">Material Plane: </span
          ><span
            >물질 세계 tends to be the most Earthlike of all 이세계 and operates under the same set of natural laws that
            our own real world does. This is the default plane for most adventures.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">Transitive 이세계:</span
          ><span>
            These three 이세계 have one important common characteristic: Each is used to get from one place to another.
            영적 세계 is a conduit to all other 이세계, while 에테리얼 세계 and 어둠의 세계 both serve as means of
            transportation within 물질 세계 they’re connected to. These 이세계 have the strongest regular interaction
            with 물질 세계 and are often accessed by using various 주문. They have native inhabitants as well.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">Inner 이세계:</span
          ><span>
            These six 이세계 are manifestations of the basic building blocks of the universe. Each is made up of a
            single type of energy or element that overwhelms all others. The natives of a particular Inner Plane are
            made of the same energy or element as the plane itself.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">Outer 이세계:</span
          ><span>
            The deities live on the Outer 이세계, as do creatures such as celestials, 데몬, and 악마. Each of the Outer
            이세계 has an 성향, representing a particular moral or ethical outlook, and the natives of each plane tend
            to behave in agreement with that plane’s 성향. The Outer 이세계 are also the final resting place of souls
            from 물질 세계, whether that final rest takes the form of calm introspection or eternal 천벌.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">Demiplanes:</span
          ><span>
            This catch-all category 엄폐 all extradimensional spaces that function like 이세계 but have measurable size
            and limited access. Other kinds of 이세계 are theoretically infinite in size, but a demiplane might be only
            a few hundred feet across.</span

        <p>Each plane of existence has its own properties—the natural laws of its universe.</p>
        <p>이세계 속성 are broken down into a number of general 범위.</p>
        <p>All 이세계 have the following kinds of traits.</p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">물리적 속성:</span
          ><span>
            These traits determine the laws of physics and nature on the plane, including how gravity and time
            function.</span

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">정령과 에너지 속성:</span

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">성향적 속성:</span
          ><span>
            Just as characters may be lawful neutral or chaotic good, many 이세계 are tied to a particular moral or
            ethical outlook.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">마법적 속성:</span
          ><span>
            Magic works differently from plane to plane, and 마법적 속성 set the boundaries for what it can and can’t
            do.</span

        <h3>물리적 속성</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">Physical Traits</div>
        <p>
          The two most important natural laws set by 물리적 속성 are how gravity works and how time passes. Other 물리적
          속성 pertain to the size and shape of a plane and how easily a plane’s nature can be altered.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">Gravity:</span
          ><span>
            The direction of gravity’s pull may be unusual, and it might even change directions within the plane
            itself.</span

            encumbrance apply. Unless otherwise noted in a 묘사, it is assumed every plane has the normal gravity
            trait.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-style: italic">Heavy Gravity: </span
          ><span
            >The gravity on a plane with this trait is much more intense than on 물질 세계. As a result, 균형, 등반,
            도약, 탑승, 수영, and 재주넘기 checks incur a –2 circumstance 페널티, as do all 명중 굴림. All item weights
            are effectively doubled, which might affect a character’s 속도. Weapon 거리 are halved. A character’s 근력
            and 민첩 scores are not affected. Characters who fall on a heavy gravity plane take 1d10 points of 피해 for
            each 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d10 points of 피해.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-style: italic">빛 Gravity: </span
          ><span
            >The gravity on a plane with this trait is less intense than on 물질 세계. As a result, creatures find that
            they can lift more, but their 이동 tend to be ungainly. Characters on a plane with 빛 gravity trait take
            a –2 circumstance 페널티 on 명중 굴림 and 균형, 탑승, 수영, and 재주넘기 checks. All items weigh half as
            much. Weapon 거리 double, and characters gain a +2 circumstance 보너스 on 등반 and 도약 checks.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          근력 and 민첩 don’t change as a result of 빛 gravity, but what you can do with such scores does change. These
          advantages apply to travelers from other 이세계 as well as natives.
        </p>
        <p>
          낙하 characters on a 빛 gravity plane take 1d4 points of 피해 for each 10 feet of the fall (maximum 20d4).

          <span style="font-style: italic">Objective Directional Gravity: </span
          ><span
            >근력 of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on 물질 세계, but the direction is not the
            traditional “down” toward the ground. It may be down toward any solid object, at an angle to the surface of
            the plane itself, or even upward.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, objective directional gravity may change from place to place. The direction of “down” may vary.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-style: italic">Subjective Directional Gravity: </span
          ><span
            >근력 of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on 물질 세계, but each individual chooses the
            direction of gravity’s pull. Such a plane has no gravity for unattended objects and nonsentient creatures.
            This sort of 환경 can be very disorienting to the newcomer, but is common on “weightless” 이세계.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Characters on a plane with subjective directional gravity can 이동 normally along a solid surface by imagining
          “down” near their feet. If suspended in midair, a character “flies” by merely choosing a “down” direction and
          “낙하” that way. Under such a procedure, an individual “falls” 150 feet in the first round and 300 feet in
          each succeeding round. 이동 is straight-line only. In order to stop, one has to 감속화 one’s 이동 by changing
          the designated “down” direction (again, moving 150 feet in the new direction in the first round and 300 feet
          per round thereafter).
        </p>
        <p>
          It takes a DC 16 지혜 check to set a new direction of gravity as a free action; this check can be made once
          per round. Any character who fails this 지혜 check in successive rounds receives a +6 보너스 on subsequent
          checks until he or she succeeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">Time:</span
          ><span>
            The rate of time’s passage can vary on different 이세계, though it remains constant within any particular
            plane. Time is always subjective for the viewer. The same subjectivity applies to various 이세계. Travelers
            may discover that they’ll pick up or lose time while moving among 이세계, but from their point of view,
            time always passes naturally.</span

          <span style="font-style: italic">Normal Time: </span
          ><span
            >This trait describes the way time passes on 물질 세계. One hour on a plane with normal time equals one hour
            on 물질 세계. Unless otherwise noted in a 묘사, every plane has the normal time trait.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-style: italic">Timeless: </span
          ><span
            >On 이세계 with this trait, time still passes, but the effects of time are diminished. How the timeless
            trait can affect certain activities or 상태이상 such as hunger, thirst, aging, the effects of 독, and 치료
            varies from plane to plane.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The danger of a timeless plane is that once one leaves such a plane for one where time flows normally,
          상태이상 such as hunger and aging do occur retroactively.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-style: italic">Flowing Time: </span
          ><span
            >On some 이세계, time can flow faster or slower. One may travel to another plane, spend a year there, then
            return to 물질 세계 to find that only six seconds have elapsed. Everything on the plane returned to is only
            a few seconds older. But for that traveler and the items, 주문, and effects working on him, that year away
            was entirely real.</span

          When designating how time works on 이세계 with flowing time, put 물질 세계’s flow of time first, followed by

        <h3>정령과 에너지 속성</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">Elemental and Energy Traits</div>
        <p>
          Four basic elements and two types of energy together make up everything. The elements are earth, air, fire,
          and water. The types of energy are positive and negative.
        </p>
        <p>
          물질 세계 reflects a balancing of those elements and energies; all are found there. Each of the Inner 이세계
          is dominated by one element or type of energy. Other 이세계 may show off various aspects of these 정령 traits.
          Many 이세계 have no 정령 or energy traits; these traits are noted in a plane’s 묘사 only when they are
          present.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-style: italic">Air-Dominant:</span
          ><span>
            Mostly open space, 이세계 with this trait have just a few bits of floating stone or other elements. They
            usually have a breathable atmosphere, though such a plane may include clouds of acidic or toxic gas.
            Creatures of the earth subtype are uncomfortable on air-dominant 이세계 because they have little or no
            natural earth to connect with. They take no actual 피해, however.</span

        </p>

          <span style="font-style: italic">Earth-Dominant:</span

            이세계 with this trait are mostly solid. Travelers who arrive 달리기 the risk of 질식 if they don’t reach a
            cavern or other pocket within the earth. Worse yet, individuals without the ability to burrow are entombed
            in the earth and must dig their way out (5 feet per turn). Creatures of the air subtype are uncomfortable on
            earth dominant 이세계 because these 이세계 are tight and claustrophobic to them. But they suffer no
            inconvenience beyond having difficulty moving.</span

          Unprotected wood, paper, cloth, and other flammable materials catch fire almost immediately, and those wearing
          unprotected flammable 의류 catch on fire. In addition, individuals take 3d10 points of fire 피해 every round
          they are on a fire-dominant plane. Creatures of the water subtype are extremely uncomfortable on fire-dominant
          이세계. Those that are made of water take double 피해 each round.

          <span style="font-style: italic">Water-Dominant:</span

            이세계 with this trait are mostly liquid. Visitors who can’t breathe water or reach a pocket of air will
            likely drown. Creatures of the fire subtype are extremely uncomfortable on water-dominant 이세계. Those made
            of fire take 1d10 points of 피해 each round.</span

            >An abundance of life characterizes 이세계 with this trait. The two kinds of positive-dominant traits are
            minor positive-dominant and major positive-dominant. A minor positive-dominant plane is a riotous explosion
            of life in all its forms. Colors are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are louder, and sensations are more
            intense as a result of the positive energy swirling through the plane. All individuals in a
            positive-dominant plane gain 빠른 치료 2 as an extraordinary ability.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Major positive-dominant 이세계 go even further. A creature on a major positive-dominant plane must make a DC
          15 Fortitude save to avoid being blinded for 10 rounds by the brilliance of the surroundings. Simply being on
          the plane grants 빠른 치료 5 as an extraordinary ability. In addition, those at full 히트 포인트 gain 5
          additional 임시 히트 포인트 per round. These 임시 히트 포인트 fade 1d20 rounds after the creature leaves the
          major positive- dominant plane. However, a creature must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round that its 임시
          히트 포인트 exceed its normal hit point total. Failing 내성 굴림 results in the creature exploding in a
          riot of energy, killing it.

          <span style="font-style: italic">Negative-Dominant:</span

            이세계 with this trait are vast, empty reaches that suck the life out of travelers who cross them. They tend
            to be lonely, haunted 이세계, drained of color and filled with 바람 bearing the soft moans of those who died
            within them. As with positive-dominant 이세계, negative-dominant 이세계 can be either minor or major. On
            minor negative-dominant 이세계, living creatures take 1d6 points of 피해 per round. At 0 히트 포인트 or
            lower, they crumble into ash.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Major negative-dominant 이세계 are even more severe. Each round, those within must make a DC 25 Fortitude save
          or gain a negative 레벨. A creature whose negative 레벨 equal its current 레벨 or 히트 다이스 is slain,
          becoming a 망령. The <span style="font-style: italic">죽음의 수호물 </span>spell protects a traveler from the
          피해 and 정령 흡수 of a negative-dominant plane.

          성향적 속성 have multiple 구성요소. First are the moral (good or evil) and ethical (lawful or chaotic)
          구성요소; a plane can have either a moral component, an ethical component, or one of each. Second, the

          Each part of the moral/ethical 성향 trait has a descriptor, either “mildly” or “strongly,” to show how
          powerful the influence of 성향 is on the plane.

        <p>
          A strongly neutral-aligned plane would stand in opposition to all other moral and ethical principles: good,
          evil, law, and chaos. Such a plane may be more concerned with 균형 of 성향 than with accommodating and
          accepting alternate points of view. In the same fashion as for other strongly aligned 이세계, strongly
          neutral-aligned 이세계 apply a –2 circumstance 페널티 to 지능-, 지혜-, or 매력-based checks by any creature
          that isn’t neutral. 페널티 is applied twice (once for law/chaos, and once for good/evil), so neutral
          good, neutral evil, lawful neutral, and chaotic neutral creatures take a –2 페널티 and lawful good, chaotic
          good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil creatures take a –4 페널티.

            Two 이세계 that are separate do not overlap or directly connect to each other. They are like planets in

            이세계 that touch at specific points are coterminous. Where they touch, a connection exists, and travelers

          <span style="font-weight: 700">Coexistent 이세계:</span
          ><span>
            If a link between two 이세계 can be created at any point, the two 이세계 are coexistent. These 이세계
            overlap each other completely. A coexistent plane can be reached from anywhere on the plane it overlaps.
            When moving on a coexistent plane, it is often possible to see into or interact with the plane it coexists
            with.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Layered 이세계</p>
        <p>
          Infinities may be broken into smaller infinities, and 이세계 into smaller, related 이세계. These layers are
          effectively separate 이세계 of existence, and each layer can have its own 이세계 속성. Layers are connected to
          each other through a variety of planar 관문, natural vortices, paths, and shifting borders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Access to a layered plane from elsewhere usually happens on a specific layer: the first layer of the plane,
          which can be either the top layer or the bottom layer, depending on the specific plane. Most fixed access
          points (such as portals and natural vortices) reach this layer, which makes it the gateway for other layers of
          the plane. The <span style="font-style: italic">이세계 전이 </span>spell also deposits the spellcaster on the
          first layer of the plane.

          <h3>에테리얼 세계</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">THE ETHEREAL PLANE</div>
          <p>
            에테리얼 세계 is coexistent with 물질 세계 and often other 이세계 as well. 물질 세계 itself is visible from
            에테리얼 세계, but it appears muted and indistinct, its colors blurring into each other and its edges
            turning fuzzy.
          </p>
          <p>
            While it is possible to see into 물질 세계 from 에테리얼 세계, 에테리얼 세계 is usually invisible to those
            on 물질 세계. Normally, creatures on 에테리얼 세계 cannot 공격 creatures on 물질 세계, and vice versa. A
            traveler on 에테리얼 세계 is invisible, incorporeal, and utterly silent to someone on 물질 세계.
          </p>
          <p>
            에테리얼 세계 is mostly empty of structures and impediments. However, the plane has its own inhabitants.
            Some of these are other ethereal travelers, but 유령 found here pose a particular peril to those who
            walk 안개.
          </p>
          <p>It has the following traits.</p>
          <p>• No gravity.</p>
          <p>• Alterable morphic. The plane contains little to alter, however.</p>
          <p>• Mildly neutral-aligned.</p>
          <p>• Normal magic. 주문 function normally on 에테리얼 세계, though they do not cross into 물질 세계.</p>
          <p>
            The only exceptions are 주문 and spell-like 능력 that have the force descriptor and 회피술 주문 that affect
            ethereal beings. Spellcasters on 물질 세계 must have some way to detect foes on 에테리얼 세계 before
            targeting them with force-based 주문, of course. While it’s possible to hit ethereal enemies with a force
            spell cast on 물질 세계, the reverse isn’t possible. No magical 공격 cross from 에테리얼 세계 to 물질 세계,
            including force 공격.

          </p>
          <p>
            어둠의 세계 is also coterminous to other 이세계. With the right spell, a character can use 어둠의
            세계 to visit other realities.
          </p>
          <p>
            어둠의 세계 is a world of black and white; color itself has been bleached from 환경. It is otherwise
            appears similar to 물질 세계.
          </p>
          <p>Despite the lack of 빛 sources, various plants, animals, and humanoids call 어둠의 세계 home.</p>
          <p>
            어둠의 세계 is magically morphic, and parts continually flow onto other 이세계. As a result, creating a
            precise map of the plane is next to impossible, despite the presence of landmarks.
          </p>
          <p>어둠의 세계 has the following traits.</p>
          <p>
            • Magically morphic. Certain 주문 modify the base material of 어둠의 세계. The utility and power of
            these 주문 within 어둠의 세계 make them particularly useful for explorers and natives alike.
          </p>
          <p>• Mildly neutral-aligned.</p>
          <p>
            • Enhanced magic. 주문 with 어둠 descriptor are enhanced on 어둠의 세계. Such 주문 are cast as
            though they were prepared with 주문 최대화 feat, though they don’t require the higher spell slots.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, specific 주문 become more powerful on 어둠의 세계.
            <span style="font-style: italic">어둠 창조술 </span>and
            <span style="font-style: italic">어둠 환기 </span>주문 are 30% as powerful as 소환술 and 강신술 they

            <span style="font-style: italic">상급 어둠 환기 </span>are 70% as powerful (not 60%), and a
            <span style="font-style: italic">그림자술 </span>spell conjures at 90% of the power of the original (not
            80%).
          </p>
          <p>
            • Impeded magic. 주문 that use or generate 빛 or fire may fizzle when cast on 어둠의 세계. A spellcaster
            attempting a spell with 빛 or fire descriptor must succeed on a 주문학 check (DC 20 + 레벨 of the
            spell). 주문 that produce 빛 are less effective in general, because all 빛 sources have their 거리 halved on
            어둠의 세계.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the dark nature of 어둠의 세계, 주문 that produce, use, or manipulate 암흑 are unaffected by the
            plane.

            영적 세계 is the space between 이세계. When a character 이동 through an interplanar portal or projects
            her spirit to a different plane of existence, she travels through 영적 세계. Even 주문 that allow
            instantaneous 이동 across a planebriefly touch 영적 세계.
          </p>
          <p>
            영적 세계 is a great, endless sphere of clear silvery sky, both above and below. Occasional bits of solid
            matter can be found here, but most of 영적 세계 is an endless, open domain.
          </p>
          <p>Both planar travelers and 피난 from other 이세계 call 영적 세계 home.</p>
          <p>영적 세계 has the following traits.</p>
          <p>• Subjective directional gravity.</p>
          <p>
            • Timeless. 나이, hunger, thirst, 독, and natural 치료 don’t function in 영적 세계, though they resume
            functioning when the traveler leaves 영적 세계.
          </p>
          <p>• Mildly neutral-aligned.</p>
          <p>
            • Enhanced magic. All 주문 and spell-like 능력 used within 영적 세계 may be employed as if they were
            improved by 빠른 주문 feat. Already quickened 주문 and spell-like 능력 are unaffected, as are 주문 from
            마법 아이템. 주문 so quickened are still prepared and cast at their unmodified 레벨. As with 빠른 주문
            feat, only one quickened spell can be cast per round.

          <p>공기 정령 세계 is an empty plane, consisting of sky above and sky below.</p>
          <p>
            공기 정령 세계 is the most comfortable and survivable of the Inner 이세계, and it is the home of all
            manner of airborne creatures. Indeed, flying creatures find themselves at a great advantage on this plane.
            While travelers without flight can survive easily here, they are at a disadvantage.

          <p>공기 정령 세계 has the following traits.</p>
          <p>

            땅 정령 세계 is a solid place made of rock, soil, and stone. An unwary and unprepared traveler may find
            himself entombed within this vast solidity of material and have his life crushed into nothingness, his
            powdered remains a warning to any foolish enough to follow.

            Despite its solid, unyielding nature, 땅 정령 세계 is varied in its consistency, ranging from relatively

            Everything is alight on 불 정령 세계. The ground is nothing more than great, evershifting plates of

            magma, not water. The oceans are made of liquid flame, and the mountains 늪괴물 with molten lava. Fire
            survives here without need for fuel or air, but flammables brought onto the plane are consumed readily.

            The eternal oceans of this plane vary between ice cold and boiling hot, between saline and fresh. They are
            perpetually in motion, wracked by currents and tides. The plane’s permanent settlements form around bits of
            flotsam and jetsam suspended within this endless liquid. These settlements drift on the tides of 물 정령

            To an observer, there’s little to see on 음 에너지 세계. It is a dark, empty place, an eternal pit where
            a traveler can fall until the plane itself steals away all 빛 and life. 음 에너지 세계 is the most
            hostile of the Inner 이세계, and the most uncaring and intolerant of life. Only creatures immune to its

            rebuking and controlling undead, gain a +10 보너스 on the roll to determine 히트 다이스 affected.

            every bit of this plane glows brightly with innate power. This power is dangerous to mortal forms, which are
            not made to handle it. Despite the beneficial effects of the plane, it is one of the most hostile of the
            Inner 이세계. An unprotected character on this plane swells with power as positive energy is force-fed into
            her. Then, her mortal frame unable to contain that power, she immolates as if she were a small planet caught
            at the edge of a supernova. Visits to 양 에너지 세계 are brief, and even then travelers must be heavily
            protected.
