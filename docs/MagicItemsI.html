창조)</h1><p>Magic items are divided into categories: armor, weapons, potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, and wondrous items. In addition, some magic items are cursed or intelligent. Finally, a few magic items are of such rarity and power that they are considered to belong to a category of their own: artifacts. Artifacts are classified in turn as minor (extremely rare but not one-of-a-kind items) or major (each one unique and extremely potent).</p><p><strong>갑옷 및 방패:</strong> Magic armor (including shields) offers improved, magical protection to the wearer. Some of these items confer abilities beyond a benefit to Armor Class. </p><p><strong>무기:</strong> Magic weapons are created with a variety of combat powers and almost always improve the attack and damage rolls of the wielder as well.</p><p><strong>물약:</strong> A potion is an elixir concocted with a spell-like effect that affects only the drinker.</p><p><strong>반지:</strong> A ring is a circular metal band worn on the finger (no more than two rings per wearer) that has a spell-like power (often a constant effect that affects the wearer).</p><p><strong>마법봉:</strong> A rod is a scepter-like item with a special power unlike that of any known spell.</p><p><strong>두루마리:</strong> A scroll is a spell magically inscribed onto paper or parchment so that it can be used later.</p><p><strong>마법지팡이:</strong> A staff has a number of different (but often related) spell effects. A newly created staff has 50 charges, and each use of the staff depletes one or more of those charges.</p><p><strong>마법막대:</strong> A wand is a short stick imbued with the power to cast a specific spell. A newly created wand has 50 charges, and each use of the wand depletes one of those charges.</p><p><strong>기타 아이템:</strong> These objects include magic jewelry, tools, books, clothing, and much more.</p><section id="h4-1-magic-items-and-detect-magic"><h4>마법 아이템 및 마법 탐지</h4><p>When <i>detect magic</i> identifies a magic item’s school of magic, this information refers to the school of the spell placed within the potion, scroll, or wand, or the prerequisite given for the item. The description of each item provides its aura strength and the school it belongs to.</p><p>If more than one spell is given as a prerequisite, use the highest-level spell. If no spells are included in the prerequisites, use the following default guidelines.</p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><th>아이템 Nature</th><th>학파</th></tr><tr><td>갑옷 및 보호 아이템</td><td>회피술</td></tr><tr><td>무기 or offensive 아이템</td><td>강신술</td></tr><tr><td>보너스 to 능력 점수, on 스킬 판정, etc.</td><td>변환술</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id="h2-2-using-items"><h2>아이템 사용</h2><p>To use a magic item, it must be activated, although sometimes activation simply means putting a ring on your finger. Some items, once donned, function constantly. In most cases, using an item requires a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. By contrast, spell completion items are treated like spells in combat and do provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p>Activating a magic item is a standard action unless the item description indicates otherwise. However, the casting time of a spell is the time required to activate the same power in an item, regardless of the type of magic item, unless the item description specifically states otherwise.</p><p>The four ways to activate magic items are described below.</p><p><strong>주문 완료:</strong> This is the activation method for scrolls. A scroll is a spell that is mostly finished. The preparation is done for the caster, so no preparation time is needed beforehand as with normal spellcasting. All that’s left to do is perform the finishing parts of the spellcasting (the final gestures, words, and so on). To use a spell completion item safely, a character must be of high enough level in the right class to cast the spell already. If he can’t already cast the spell, there’s a chance he’ll make a mistake. Activating a spell completion item is a standard action and provokes attacks of opportunity exactly as casting a spell does.</p><p><strong>주문 트리거:</strong> Spell trigger activation is similar to spell completion, but it’s even simpler. No gestures or spell finishing is needed, just a special knowledge of spellcasting that an appropriate character would know, and a single word that must be spoken. Anyone with a spell on his or her spell list knows how to use a spell trigger item that stores that spell. (This is the case even for a character who can’t actually cast spells, such as a 3rd-level paladin.) The user must still determine what spell is stored in the item before she can activate it. Activating a spell trigger item is a standard action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p><strong>명령 단어:</strong> If no activation method is suggested either in the magic item description or by the nature of the item, assume that a command word is needed to activate it. Command word activation means that a character speaks the word and the item activates. No other special knowledge is needed.</p><p>A command word can be a real word, but when this is the case, the holder of the item runs the risk of activating the item accidentally by speaking the word in normal conversation. More often, the command word is some seemingly nonsensical word, or a word or phrase from an ancient language no longer in common use. Activating a command word magic item is a standard action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p>Sometimes the command word to activate an item is written right on the item. Occasionally, it might be hidden within a pattern or design engraved on, carved into, or built into the item, or the item might bear a clue to the command word.</p><p>The Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (history) skills might be useful in helping to identify command words or deciphering clues regarding them. A successful check against DC 30 is needed to come up with the word itself. If that check is failed, succeeding on a second check (DC 25) might provide some insight into a clue.</p><p>The spells <i>identify</i> and <i>analyze dweomer</i> both reveal command words.</p><p><strong>사용 발동:</strong> This type of item simply has to be used in order to activate it. A character has to drink a potion, swing a sword, interpose a shield to deflect a blow in combat, look through a lens, sprinkle dust, wear a ring, or don a hat. Use activation is generally straightforward and self-explanatory.</p><p>Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears. Continually functioning items are practically always items that one wears. A few must simply be in the character’s possession (on his person). However, some items made for wearingmust still be activated. Although this activation sometimes requires a command word (see above), usually it means mentally willing the activation to happen. The description of an item states whether a command word is needed in such a case.</p><p>Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated magic item is either a standard action or not an action at all and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless the use involves performing an action that provokes an attack of opportunity in itself. If the use of the item takes time before a magical effect occurs, then use activation is a standard action. If the item’s activation is subsumed in its use and takes no extra time use activation is not an action at all.</p><p>Use activation doesn’t mean that if you use an item, you automatically know what it can do. You must know (or at least guess) what the item can do and then use the item in order to activate it, unless the benefit of the item comes automatically, such from drinking a potion or swinging a sword.</p></section><section id="h2-3-size-and-magic-items"><h2>크기 및 마법 아이템</h2><p>When an article of magic clothing or jewelry is discovered, most of the time size shouldn’t be an issue. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they adjust themselves magically to the wearer. Size should not keep characters of various kinds from using magic items.</p><p>There may be rare exceptions, especially with racial specific items. </p><p><strong>갑옷 및 무기 크기:</strong> Armor and weapons that are found at random have a 30% chance of being Small (01–30), a 60% chance of being Medium (31–90), and a 10% chance of being any other size (91–100).</p></section><section id="h2-4-magic-items-on-the-body"><h2>착용 가능한 마법 아이템</h2><p>Many magic items need to be donned by a character who wants to employ them or benefit from their abilities. It’s possible for a creature with a humanoid-shaped body to wear as many as twelve magic items at the same time. However, each of those items must be worn on (or over) a particular part of the body.</p><p>A humanoid-shaped body can be decked out in magic gear consisting of one item from each of the following groups, keyed to which place on the body the item is worn.</p><p>• One headband, hat, helmet, or phylactery on the head</p><p>• One pair of eye lenses or goggles on or over the eyes</p><p>• One amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab around the neck</p><p>• One vest, vestment, or shirt on the torso</p><p>• One robe or suit of armor on the body (over a vest, vestment, or shirt)</p><p>• One belt around the waist (over a robe or suit of armor)</p><p>• One cloak, cape, or mantle around the shoulders (over a robe or suit of armor)</p><p>• One pair of bracers or bracelets on the arms or wrists</p><p>• One glove, pair of gloves, or pair of gauntlets on the hands</p><p>• One ring on each hand (or two rings on one hand)</p><p>• One pair of boots or shoes on the feet</p><p>Of course, a character may carry or possess as many items of the same type as he wishes. However, additional items beyond those listed above have no effect. </p><p>Some itemscan be worn or carried without taking up space on a character’s body. The description of an item indicates when an item has this property.</p></section><section id="h2-5-saving-throws-against-magic-item-powers"><h2>마법 아이템이 가진 힘에 대한 내성 굴림</h2><p>Magic items produce spells or spell-like effects. For a saving throw against a spell or spell-like effect from a magic item, the DC is 10 + the level of the spell or effect + the ability modifier of the minimum ability score needed to cast that level of spell. </p><p>Staffs are an exception to the rule. Treat the saving throw as if the wielder cast the spell, including caster level and all modifiers to save DC. </p><p>Most item descriptions give saving throw DCs for various effects, particularly when the effect has no exact spell equivalent (making its level otherwise difficult to determine quickly).</p></section><section id="h2-6-damaging-magic-items"><h2>마법 아이템의 피해</h2><p>A magic item doesn’t need to make a saving throw unless it is unattended, it is specifically targeted by the effect, or its wielder rolls a natural 1 on his save. Magic items should always get a saving throw against spells that might deal damage to them— even against attacks from which a nonmagical item would normally get no chance to save. Magic items use the same saving throw bonus for all saves, no matter what the type (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will). A magic item’s saving throw bonus equals 2 + one-half its caster level (round down). The only exceptions to this are intelligent magic items, which make Will saves based on their own Wisdom scores.</p><p>Magic items, unless otherwise noted, take damage as nonmagical items of the same sort. A damaged magic item continues to function, but if it is destroyed, all its magical power is lost.</p></section><section id="h2-7-repairing-magic-items"><h2>마법 아이템의 수리</h2><p>Some magic items take damage over the course of an adventure. It costs no more to repair a magic item with the Craft skill than it does to repair its nonmagical counterpart. The <i>make whole</i> spell also repairs a damaged—but not completely broken—magic item.</p></section><section id="h2-8-intelligent-items"><h2>지능있는 아이템</h2><p>Some magic items, particularly weapons, have an intelligence all their own. Only permanent magic items (as opposed to those with a single use or those with charges) can be intelligent. (This means that potions, scrolls, and wands, among other items, are never intelligent.)</p><p>In general, less than 1% of magic items have intelligence. </p></section><section id="h2-9-cursed-items"><h2>저주 받은 아이템</h2><p>Some items are cursed—incorrectly made, or corrupted by outside forces. Cursed items might be particularly dangerous to the user, or they might be normal items with a minor flaw, an inconvenient requirement, or an unpredictable nature. Randomly generated items are cursed 5% of the time. </p></section><section id="h2-10-charges-doses-and-multiple-uses"><h2>충전, 용량, 다회 사용</h2><p>Many items, particularly wands and staffs, are limited in power by the number of charges they hold. Normally, charged items have 50 charges at most. If such an item is found as a random part of a treasure, roll d% and divide by 2 to determine the number of charges left (round down, minimum 1). If the item has a maximum number of charges other than 50, roll randomly to determine how many charges are left. </p><p>Prices listed are always for fully charged items. (When an item is created, it is fully charged.) For an item that’s worthless when its charges run out (which is the case for almost all charged items), the value of the partially used item is proportional to the number of charges left. For an item that has usefulness in addition to its charges, only part of the item’s value is based on the number of charges left.</p></section></section><section id="h1-11-magic-item-descriptions"><h1>마법 아이템 설명</h1><p>Each general type of magic item gets an overall description, followed by descriptions of specific items.</p><p>General descriptions include notes on activation, random generation, and other material. The AC, hardness, hit points, and break DC are given for typical examples of some magic items. The AC assumes that the item is unattended and includes a –5 penalty for the item’s effective Dexterity of 0. If a creature holds the item, use the creature’s Dexterity modifier in place of the –5 penalty.</p><p>Some individual items, notably those that simply store spells and nothing else, don’t get full-blown descriptions. Reference the spell’s description for details, modified by the form of the item (potion, scroll, wand, and so on). Assume that the spell is cast at the minimum level required to cast it</p><p>Items with full descriptions have their powers detailed, and each of the following topics is covered in notational form at the end of the description.</p><p>• Aura: Most of the time, a <i>detect magic</i> spell will reveal the school of magic associated with a magic item and the strength of the aura an item emits. This information (when applicable) is given at the beginning of the item’s notational entry. See the <i>detect magic</i> spell descriptionfor details.</p><p>• Caster Level: The next item in a notational entry gives the caster level of the item, indicating its relative power. The caster level determines the item’s saving throw bonus, as well as range or other level-dependent aspects of the powers of the item (if variable). It also determines the level that must be contended with should the item come under the effect of a <i>dispel magic</i> spell or similar situation. This information is given in the form “CL x,” where “CL” is an abbreviation for caster level and “x” is an ordinal number representing the caster level itself.</p><p>For potions, scrolls, and wands, the creator can set the caster level of an item at any number high enough to cast the stored spell and not higher than her own caster level. For other magic items, the caster level is determined by the item itself. In this case, the creator’s caster level must be as high as the item’s caster level (and prerequisites may effectively put a higher minimum on the creator’s level).</p><p>• Prerequisites: Certain requirements must be met in order for a character to create a magic item. These include feats, spells, and miscellaneous requirements such as level, alignment, and race or kind. The prerequisites for creation of an item are given immediately following the item’s caster level.</p><p>A spell prerequisite may be provided by a character who has prepared the spell (or who knows the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard), or through the use of a spell completion or spell trigger magic item or a spell-like ability that produces the desired spell effect. For each day that passes in the creation process, the creator must expend one spell completion item or one charge from a spell trigger item if either of those objects is used to supply a prerequisite.</p><p>It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the creation of an item, with each participant providing one or more of the prerequisites. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary.</p><p>If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they must agree among themselves who will be considered the creator for the purpose of determinations where the creator’s level must be known. The character designated as the creator pays the XP required to make the item.</p><p>Typically, a list of prerequisites includes one feat and one or more spells (or some other requirement in addition to the feat).</p><p>When two spells at the end of a list are separated by “or,” one of those spells is required in addition to every other spell mentioned prior to the last two.</p><p>• Market Price: This gold piece value, given following the word “Price,” represents the price someone should expect to pay to buy the item. The market price for an item that can be constructed with an item creation feat is usually equal to the base price plus the price for any components (material or XP).</p><p>• Cost to Create: The next part of a notational entry is the cost in gp and XP to create the item, given following the word</p><p>“Cost.” This information appears only for items with components (material or XP), which make their market prices higher than their base prices. The cost to create includes the costs derived from the base cost plus the costs of the components.</p><p>Items without components do not have a “Cost” entry. For them, the market price and the base price are the same. The cost in gp is 1/2 the market price, and the cost in XP is 1/25 the market price.</p><p>• Weight: The notational entry for many wondrous items ends with a value for the item’s weight. When a weight figure is not given, the item has no weight worth noting (for purposes of determining how much of a load a character can carry).</p><div class="table-container"><table><caption>Table: Random Magic Item Generation</caption><tbody><tr><th>하급</th><th>중간</th><th>상급</th><th>아이템</th></tr><tr><td>01–04</td><td>01–10</td><td>01–10</td><td>갑옷 및 방패</td></tr><tr><td>05–09</td><td>11–20</td><td>11–20</td><td>무기</td></tr><tr><td>10–44</td><td>21–30</td><td>21–25</td><td>물약</td></tr><tr><td>45–46</td><td>31–40</td><td>26–35</td><td>반지</td></tr><tr><td>—</td><td>41–50</td><td>36–45</td><td>마법봉</td></tr><tr><td>47–81</td><td>51–65</td><td>46–55</td><td>두루마리</td></tr><tr><td>—</td><td>66–68</td><td>56–75</td><td>마법지팡이</td></tr><tr><td>82–91</td><td>69–83</td><td>76–80</td><td>마법막대</td></tr><tr><td>92–100</td><td>84–100</td><td>81–100</td><td>기타 아이템</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id="h1-12-creating-magic-items"><h1>마법 아이템 제작</h1><p>To create magic items, spellcasters use special feats. They invest time, money, and their own personal energy (in the form of experience points) in an item’s creation.</p><p>Note that all items have prerequisites in their descriptions. These prerequisites must be met for the item to be created. Most of the time, they take the form of spells that must be known by the item’s creator (although access through another magic item or spellcaster is allowed).</p><p>While item creation costs are handled in detail below, note that normally the two primary factors are the caster level of the creator and the level of the spell or spells put into the item. A creator can create an item at a lower caster level than her own, but never lower than the minimum level needed to cast the needed spell. Using metamagic feats, a caster can place spells in items at a higher level than normal.</p><p>Magic supplies for items are always half of the base price in gp and 1/25 of the base price in XP. For many items, the market price equals the base price.</p><p>Armor, shields, weapons, and items with a value independent of their magically enhanced properties add their item cost to the market price. The item cost does not influence the base price (which determines the cost of magic supplies and the experience point cost), but it does increase the final market price.</p><p>In addition, some items cast or replicate spells with costly material components or with XP components. For these items, the market price equals the base price plus an extra price for the spell component costs. Each XP in the component costs adds 5 gp to the market price. The cost to create these items is the magic supplies cost and the base XP cost (both determined by the base price) plus the costs for the components. Descriptions of these items include an entry that gives the total cost of creating the item.</p><p>The creator also needs a fairly quiet, comfortable, and well-lit place in which to work. Any place suitable for preparing spells is suitable for making items. Creating an item requires one day per 1,000 gp in the item’s base price, with a minimum of at least one day. Potions are an exception to this rule; they always take just one day to brew.

The easiest way to come up with a price is to match the new item to an item that is already priced that price as a guide. Otherwise, use the guidelines summarized on Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values.</p><p><strong>여러 비슷한 능력:</strong> For items with multiple similar abilities that don’t take up space on a character’s body use the following formula: Calculate the price of the single most costly ability, then add 75% of the value of the next most costly ability, plus one-half the value of any other abilities.</p><p><strong>여러 다른 능력:</strong> Abilities such as an attack roll bonus or saving throw bonus and a spell-like function are not similar, and their values are simply added together to determine the cost. For items that do take up a space on a character’s body each additional power not only has no discount but instead has a 50% increase in price.</p><p><strong>0-레벨 주문:</strong> When multiplying spell levels to determine value, 0- level spells should be treated as 1/2 level.</p><p><strong>기타 고려사항:</strong> Once you have a final cost figure, reduce that number if either of the following conditions applies:</p><p>—<i>Item Requires Skill to Use:</i> Some items require a specific skill to get them to function. This factor should reduce the cost about 10%.</p><p>—<i>Item Requires Specific Class or Alignment to Use:</i> Even more restrictive than requiring a skill, this limitation cuts the cost by 30%.</p><p>Prices presented in the magic item descriptions (the gold piece value following the item’s caster level) are the market value, which is generally twice what it costs the creator to make the item.</p><p>Since different classes get access to certain spells at different levels, the prices for two characters to make the same item might actually be different. An item is only worth two times what the caster of lowest possible level can make it for. Calculate the market price based on the lowest possible level caster, no matter who makes the item.</p><p>Not all items adhere to these formulas directly. The reasons for this are several. First and foremost, these few formulas aren’t enough to truly gauge the exact differences between items. The price of a magic item may be modified based on its actual worth. The formulas only provide a starting point. The pricing of scrolls assumes that, whenever possible, a wizard or cleric created it. Potions and wands follow the formulas exactly. Staffs follow the formulas closely, and other items require at least some judgment calls.</p></section><section id="h2-14-masterwork-items"><h2>명품 아이템</h2><p>Masterwork items are extraordinarily well-made items.

In addition, some magic items are cursed or intelligent. Finally, a few magic items are of such rarity and power that they are considered to belong to a category of their own: artifacts.

Some items, once donned, function constantly. In most cases, using an item requires a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. By contrast, spell completion items are treated like spells in combat and do provoke attacks of opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eActivating a magic item is a standard action unless the item description indicates otherwise. However, the casting time of a spell is the time required to activate the same power in an item, regardless of the type of magic item, unless the item description specifically states otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe four ways to activate magic items are described below.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e주문 완료:\u003c/strong\u003e This is the activation method for scrolls. A scroll is a spell that is mostly finished. The preparation is done for the caster, so no preparation time is needed beforehand as with normal spellcasting. All that’s left to do is perform the finishing parts of the spellcasting (the final gestures, words, and so on). To use a spell completion item safely, a character must be of high enough level in the right class to cast the spell already. If he can’t already cast the spell, there’s a chance he’ll make a mistake. Activating a spell completion item is a standard action and provokes attacks of opportunity exactly as casting a spell does.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e주문 트리거:\u003c/strong\u003e Spell trigger activation is similar to spell completion, but it’s even simpler. No gestures or spell finishing is needed, just a special knowledge of spellcasting that an appropriate character would know, and a single word that must be spoken. Anyone with a spell on his or her spell list knows how to use a spell trigger item that stores that spell. (This is the case even for a character who can’t actually cast spells, such as a 3rd-level paladin.) The user must still determine what spell is stored in the item before she can activate it. Activating a spell trigger item is a standard action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e명령 단어:\u003c/strong\u003e If no activation method is suggested either in the magic item description or by the nature of the item, assume that a command word is needed to activate it. Command word activation means that a character speaks the word and the item activates. No other special knowledge is needed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA command word can be a real word, but when this is the case, the holder of the item runs the risk of activating the item accidentally by speaking the word in normal conversation. More often, the command word is some seemingly nonsensical word, or a word or phrase from an ancient language no longer in common use. Activating a command word magic item is a standard action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSometimes the command word to activate an item is written right on the item. Occasionally, it might be hidden within a pattern or design engraved on, carved into, or built into the item, or the item might bear a clue to the command word.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (history) skills might be useful in helping to identify command words or deciphering clues regarding them. A successful check against DC 30 is needed to come up with the word itself. If that check is failed, succeeding on a second check (DC 25) might provide some insight into a clue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe spells \u003ci\u003eidentify\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eanalyze dweomer\u003c/i\u003e both reveal command words.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e사용 발동:\u003c/strong\u003e This type of item simply has to be used in order to activate it. A character has to drink a potion, swing a sword, interpose a shield to deflect a blow in combat, look through a lens, sprinkle dust, wear a ring, or don a hat. Use activation is generally straightforward and self-explanatory.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany use-activated items are objects that a character wears. Continually functioning items are practically always items that one wears. A few must simply be in the character’s possession (on his person). However, some items made for wearingmust still be activated. Although this activation sometimes requires a command word (see above), usually it means mentally willing the activation to happen. The description of an item states whether a command word is needed in such a case.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated magic item is either a standard action or not an action at all and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless the use involves performing an action that provokes an attack of opportunity in itself. If the use of the item takes time before a magical effect occurs, then use activation is a standard action. If the item’s activation is subsumed in its use and takes no extra time use activation is not an action at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUse activation doesn’t mean that if you use an item, you automatically know what it can do. You must know (or at least guess) what the item can do and then use the item in order to activate it, unless the benefit of the item comes automatically, such from drinking a potion or swinging a sword.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003csection id=\"h2-3-size-and-magic-items\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003e크기 및 마법 아이템\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen an article of magic clothing or jewelry is discovered, most of the time size shouldn’t be an issue.

It’s possible for a creature with a humanoid-shaped body to wear as many as twelve magic items at the same time. However, each of those items must be worn on (or over) a particular part of the body.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA humanoid-shaped body can be decked out in magic gear consisting of one item from each of the following groups, keyed to which place on the body the item is worn.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• One headband, hat, helmet, or phylactery on the head\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• One pair of eye lenses or goggles on or over the eyes\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• One amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab around the neck\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• One vest, vestment, or shirt on the torso\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• One robe or suit of armor on the body (over a vest, vestment, or shirt)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• One belt around the waist (over a robe or suit of armor)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• One cloak, cape, or mantle around the shoulders (over a robe or suit of armor)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• One pair of bracers or bracelets on the arms or wrists\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• One glove, pair of gloves, or pair of gauntlets on the hands\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• One ring on each hand (or two rings on one hand)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• One pair of boots or shoes on the feet\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, a character may carry or possess as many items of the same type as he wishes.

Treat the saving throw as if the wielder cast the spell, including caster level and all modifiers to save DC. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost item descriptions give saving throw DCs for various effects, particularly when the effect has no exact spell equivalent (making its level otherwise difficult to determine quickly).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003csection id=\"h2-6-damaging-magic-items\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003e마법 아이템의 피해\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA magic item doesn’t need to make a saving throw unless it is unattended, it is specifically targeted by the effect, or its wielder rolls a natural 1 on his save. Magic items should always get a saving throw against spells that might deal damage to them— even against attacks from which a nonmagical item would normally get no chance to save. Magic items use the same saving throw bonus for all saves, no matter what the type (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will). A magic item’s saving throw bonus equals 2 + one-half its caster level (round down). The only exceptions to this are intelligent magic items, which make Will saves based on their own Wisdom scores.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMagic items, unless otherwise noted, take damage as nonmagical items of the same sort.

Normally, charged items have 50 charges at most. If such an item is found as a random part of a treasure, roll d% and divide by 2 to determine the number of charges left (round down, minimum 1). If the item has a maximum number of charges other than 50, roll randomly to determine how many charges are left. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrices listed are always for fully charged items. (When an item is created, it is fully charged.) For an item that’s worthless when its charges run out (which is the case for almost all charged items), the value of the partially used item is proportional to the number of charges left. For an item that has usefulness in addition to its charges, only part of the item’s value is based on the number of charges left.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003csection id=\"h1-11-magic-item-descriptions\"\u003e\u003ch1\u003e마법 아이템 설명\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach general type of magic item gets an overall description, followed by descriptions of specific items.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGeneral descriptions include notes on activation, random generation, and other material. The AC, hardness, hit points, and break DC are given for typical examples of some magic items. The AC assumes that the item is unattended and includes a –5 penalty for the item’s effective Dexterity of 0. If a creature holds the item, use the creature’s Dexterity modifier in place of the –5 penalty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome individual items, notably those that simply store spells and nothing else, don’t get full-blown descriptions.

This information (when applicable) is given at the beginning of the item’s notational entry. See the \u003ci\u003edetect magic\u003c/i\u003e spell descriptionfor details.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• Caster Level: The next item in a notational entry gives the caster level of the item, indicating its relative power. The caster level determines the item’s saving throw bonus, as well as range or other level-dependent aspects of the powers of the item (if variable). It also determines the level that must be contended with should the item come under the effect of a \u003ci\u003edispel magic\u003c/i\u003e spell or similar situation. This information is given in the form “CL x,” where “CL” is an abbreviation for caster level and “x” is an ordinal number representing the caster level itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor potions, scrolls, and wands, the creator can set the caster level of an item at any number high enough to cast the stored spell and not higher than her own caster level. For other magic items, the caster level is determined by the item itself. In this case, the creator’s caster level must be as high as the item’s caster level (and prerequisites may effectively put a higher minimum on the creator’s level).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• Prerequisites: Certain requirements must be met in order for a character to create a magic item. These include feats, spells, and miscellaneous requirements such as level, alignment, and race or kind. The prerequisites for creation of an item are given immediately following the item’s caster level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA spell prerequisite may be provided by a character who has prepared the spell (or who knows the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard), or through the use of a spell completion or spell trigger magic item or a spell-like ability that produces the desired spell effect. For each day that passes in the creation process, the creator must expend one spell completion item or one charge from a spell trigger item if either of those objects is used to supply a prerequisite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the creation of an item, with each participant providing one or more of the prerequisites. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they must agree among themselves who will be considered the creator for the purpose of determinations where the creator’s level must be known. The character designated as the creator pays the XP required to make the item.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTypically, a list of prerequisites includes one feat and one or more spells (or some other requirement in addition to the feat).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen two spells at the end of a list are separated by “or,” one of those spells is required in addition to every other spell mentioned prior to the last two.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• Market Price: This gold piece value, given following the word “Price,” represents the price someone should expect to pay to buy the item. The market price for an item that can be constructed with an item creation feat is usually equal to the base price plus the price for any components (material or XP).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• Cost to Create: The next part of a notational entry is the cost in gp and XP to create the item, given following the word\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Cost.” This information appears only for items with components (material or XP), which make their market prices higher than their base prices. The cost to create includes the costs derived from the base cost plus the costs of the components.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eItems without components do not have a “Cost” entry.

They invest time, money, and their own personal energy (in the form of experience points) in an item’s creation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote that all items have prerequisites in their descriptions. These prerequisites must be met for the item to be created. Most of the time, they take the form of spells that must be known by the item’s creator (although access through another magic item or spellcaster is allowed).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile item creation costs are handled in detail below, note that normally the two primary factors are the caster level of the creator and the level of the spell or spells put into the item. A creator can create an item at a lower caster level than her own, but never lower than the minimum level needed to cast the needed spell. Using metamagic feats, a caster can place spells in items at a higher level than normal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMagic supplies for items are always half of the base price in gp and 1/25 of the base price in XP. For many items, the market price equals the base price.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eArmor, shields, weapons, and items with a value independent of their magically enhanced properties add their item cost to the market price. The item cost does not influence the base price (which determines the cost of magic supplies and the experience point cost), but it does increase the final market price.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition, some items cast or replicate spells with costly material components or with XP components. For these items, the market price equals the base price plus an extra price for the spell component costs. Each XP in the component costs adds 5 gp to the market price. The cost to create these items is the magic supplies cost and the base XP cost (both determined by the base price) plus the costs for the components. Descriptions of these items include an entry that gives the total cost of creating the item.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe creator also needs a fairly quiet, comfortable, and well-lit place in which to work. Any place suitable for preparing spells is suitable for making items. Creating an item requires one day per 1,000 gp in the item’s base price, with a minimum of at least one day. Potions are an exception to this rule; they always take just one day to brew. The character must spend the gold and XP at the beginning of the construction process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe caster works for 8 hours each day. He cannot rush the process by working longer each day. But the days need not be consecutive, and the caster can use the rest of his time as he sees fit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA character can work on only one item at a time. If a character starts work on a new item, all materials used and XP spent on the under-construction item are wasted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe secrets of creating artifacts are long

제작\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo create a wondrous item, a character usually needs some sort of equipment or tools to work on the item. She also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the item itself or the pieces of the item to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the item. Wondrous item costs are difficult to formularize. Refer to Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values and use the item prices in the item descriptions as a guideline. Creating an item costs half the market value listed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the item, the creator must have prepared the spells to be cast (or must know the spells, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) but need not provide any material components or focuses the spells require, nor are any XP costs inherent in a prerequisite spell incurred in the creation of the item. The act of working on the item triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the item’s creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreating some items may entail other prerequisites beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCrafting a wondrous item requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eItem Creation Feat Required: Craft Wondrous Item.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003csection id=\"h2-24-intelligent-item-creation\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003e지능있는 아이템 창조\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo create an intelligent item, a character must have a caster level of 15th or higher. Time and creation cost are based on the normal item creation rules, with the market price values on Table: Item Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and Capabilities treated as additions to time, gp cost, and XP cost. The item’s alignment is the same as its creator’s.

The cost to do this is the same as if the item was not magical.
