Magically imbued with sentience, these items think and feel the same way characters do and should be treated as NPCs. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes. Only permanent magic items (as opposed to single-use items or those with charges) can be intelligent. (This means that potions, scrolls, and wands, among other items, are never intelligent.) In general, less than 1% of magic items have intelligence.</p><p>Intelligent items can actually be considered creatures because they have Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Treat them as constructs. Intelligent items often have the ability to illuminate their surroundings at will (as magic weapons do); many cannot see otherwise.</p><p>Unlike most magic items, intelligent items can activate their own powers without waiting for a command word from their owner. Intelligent items act during their owner’s turn in the initiative order.</p><section id="h2-2-intelligent-item-alignment"><h2 title="INTELLIGENT ITEM ALIGNMENT">지능있는 아이템 성향</h2><p>Any item with intelligence has an alignment. Note that intelligent weapons already have alignments, either stated or by implication. If you’re generating a random intelligent weapon, that weapon’s alignment must fit with any alignment-oriented special abilities it has.</p><p>Any character whose alignment does not correspond to that of the item (except as noted by the asterisks on the table) gains one negative level if he or she so much as picks up the item. Although this negative level never results in actual level loss, it remains as long as the item is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including <i>restoration</i> spells). This negative level is cumulative with any other penalties the item might already place on inappropriate wielders. Items with Ego scores (see below) of 20 to 29 bestow two negative levels. Items with Ego scores of 30 or higher bestow three negative levels.</p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><th colspan="2" title="Intelligent Item Alignment">지능있는 아이템 성향</th></tr><tr><th style="min-width: 4.5em;" title="d%">d%</th><th style="min-width: 9.525em;" title="Alignment of Item">성향 of 아이템</th></tr><tr><td>01–05</td><td>Chaotic good</td></tr><tr><td>06–15</td><td>Chaotic neutral*</td></tr><tr><td>16–20</td><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><td>21–25</td><td>Neutral evil*</td></tr><tr><td>26–30</td><td>Lawful evil</td></tr><tr><td>31–55</td><td>Lawful good</td></tr><tr><td>56–60</td><td>Lawful neutral*</td></tr><tr><td>61–80</td><td>Neutral good*</td></tr><tr><td>81–100</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">* The item can also be used by any character whose alignment corresponds to the nonneutral portion of the item’s alignment.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id="h2-3-languages-spoken-by-item"><h2 title="LANGUAGES SPOKEN BY ITEM">아이템이 사용하는 언어</h2><p>Like a character, an intelligent item speaks Common plus one additional language per point of Intelligence bonus.

A purpose of “defeat/slay arcane spellcasters” doesn’t mean that the sword forces the wielder to kill every wizard she sees. Nor does it mean that the sword believes it is possible to kill every wizard, sorcerer, and bard in the world. It does mean that the item hates arcane spellcasters and wants to bring the local wizard’s cabal to ruin, as well as end the rule of a sorceress-queen in a nearby land. Likewise, a purpose of “defend elves” doesn’t mean that if the wielder is an elf, he only wants to help himself. It means that the item wants to be used in furthering the cause of elves, stamping out their enemies and aiding their leaders. A purpose of “defeat/slay all” isn’t just a matter of self-preservation.

The item is, of course, absolutely true to its alignment. If the character who possesses the item is not true to that alignment’s goals or the item’s special purpose, personality conflict—item against character—results. Similarly, any item with an Ego score of 20 or higher always considers itself superior to any character, and a personality conflict results if the possessor does not always agree with the item.</p><p>When a personality conflict occurs, the possessor must make a Will saving throw (DC = item’s Ego). If the possessor succeeds, she is dominant. If she fails, the item is dominant. Dominance lasts for one day or until a critical situation occurs (such as a major battle, a serious threat to either the item or the character, and so on). Should an item gain dominance, it resists the character’s desires and demands concessions such as any of the following.</p><p>• Removal of associates or items whose alignment or personality is distasteful to the item.</p><p>• The character divesting herself of all other magic items or items of a certain type.</p><p>• Obedience from the character so the item can direct where they go for its own purposes.</p><p>• Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the item.</p><p>• Magical protections and devices to protect the item from molestation when it is not in use.</p><p>• That the character carry the item with her on all occasions.</p><p>• That the character relinquish the item in favor of a more suitable possessor due to alignment differences or conduct.</p><p>In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher measures, such as the following acts:</p><p>• Force its possessor into combat.</p><p>• Refuse to strike opponents.</p><p>• Strike at its wielder or her associates.</p><p>• Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent.</p><p>• Cause itself to drop from the character’s grasp.</p><p>Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns between the character’s and item’s alignments or when their purposes and personalities are well matched. Even so, an item might wish to have a lesser character possess it in order to easily establish and maintain dominance over him, or a higher-level possessor so as to better accomplish its goals.</p><p>All magic items with personalities desire to play an important role in whatever activity is under way, particularly combat. Such items are rivals of each other, even if they are of the same alignment. No intelligent item wants to share its wielder with others. An intelligent item is aware of the presence of any other intelligent item within 60 feet, and most intelligent items try their best to mislead or distract their host so that she ignores or destroys the rival. Of course, alignment might change this sort of behavior. </p><p>Items with personalities are never totally controlled or silenced by the characters who possess them, even though they may never successfully control their possessors. They may be powerless to force their demands but remain undaunted and continue to air their wishes and demands.</p></section></section><section id="h1-10-cursed-items"><h1 title="CURSED ITEMS">저주 받은 아이템</h1><p>Cursed items are magic items with some sort of potentially negative impact.

The interesting point to keep in mind here is that these items aren’t always bad to have. Opposite-effect items include weapons that impose penalties on attack and damage rolls rather than bonuses. Just as a character shouldn’t necessarily immediately know what the enhancement bonus of a noncursed magic item is, she shouldn’t immediately know that a weapon is cursed. Once she knows, however, the item can be discarded unless some sort of compulsion is placed upon it that compels the wielder to keep and use it.

Nevertheless, some items have much more stringent requirements that must be met for them to be usable. To keep an item with this kind of curse functioning, one or more of the following conditions must be met.</p><p>• Character must eat twice as much as normal.</p><p>• Character must sleep twice as much as normal.</p><p>• Character must undergo a specific quest (one time only, and then item functions normally thereafter).</p><p>• Character must sacrifice (destroy) 100 gp worth of valuables per day.</p><p>• Character must sacrifice (destroy) 2,000 gp worth of magic items each week.</p><p>• Character must swear fealty to a particular noble or his family.</p><p>• Character must discard all other magic items.</p><p>• Character must worship a particular deity.</p><p>• Character must change her name to a specific name. (The item only works for characters of that name.)</p><p>• Character must add a specific class at the next opportunity if not of that class already.</p><p>• Character must have a minimum number of ranks in a particular skill.</p><p>• Character must sacrifice some part of her life energy (2 points of Constitution) one time. If the character gets the Constitution points back (such as from a <i>restoration</i> spell), the item ceases functioning. (The item does not cease functioning if the character receives a Constitution increase caused by level gain, a <i>wish,</i> or the use of a magic item.)</p><p>• Item must be cleansed with holy water each day.</p><p>• Item must be used to kill a living creature each day.</p><p>• Item must be bathed in volcanic lava once per month.</p><p>• Item must be used at least once a day, or it won’t function again for its current possessor.</p><p>• Item must draw blood when wielded (weapons only). It can’t be put away or exchanged for another weapon until it has scored a hit.</p><p>• Item must have a particular spell cast upon it each day (such as <i>bless, atonement,</i> or <i>animate objects</i>).</p><p>Requirements are so dependent upon suitability to the item that they should never be determined randomly. An item with a requirement that is also intelligent often imposes its requirement through its personality. If the requirement is not met, the item ceases to function. If it is met, usually the item functions for one day before the requirement must be met again (although some requirements are one time only, others monthly, and still others continuous).</p><p><strong title="Drawback:">단점:</strong> Items with drawbacks are usually still beneficial to the possessor but they also carry some negative aspect.

Those failing a DC 15 Fortitude save take 2d6 points of Constitution damage immediately. In addition, those failing a second DC 15 Fortitude save 1 minute later are dealt 1d6 points of Constitution damage.

In the former instance, they appear to be <i>gloves of Dexterity.</i> In the latter case, they appear to be <i>gauntlets of ogre power.</i> The gauntlets perform according to every test as if they were <i>gloves of Dexterity</i> or <i>gauntlets of ogre power</i> until the wearer finds herself under attack or in a life-and-death situation. At that time, the curse is activated. The wearer becomes fumble-fingered, with a 50% chance each round of dropping anything held in either hand. The gauntlets also lower Dexterity by 2 points. Once the curse is activated, the gloves can be removed only by means of a <i>remove curse</i> spell, a <i>wish,</i> or a <i>miracle.</i></p><p>Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Create Wondrous Item, <i>bestow curse;</i> Price 1,300 gp.</p><p><strong title="Helm of Opposite Alignment:">반대 성향의 헬멧:</strong> This metal hat looks like a typical helmet. When placed upon the head, however, its curse immediately takes effect (Will DC 15 negates). On a failed save, the alignment of the wearer is radically altered to an alignment as different as possible from the former alignment—good to evil, chaotic to lawful, neutral to some extreme commitment (LE, LG, CE, or CG). Alteration in alignment is mental as well as moral, and the individual changed by the magic thoroughly enjoys his new outlook. A character who succeeds on his save can continue to wear the helmet without suffering the effect of the curse, but if he takes it off and later puts it on again, another save is required. The curse only works once; that is, a character whose alignment has been changed cannot change it again by donning the helmet a second time.</p><p>Only a <i>wish</i> or a <i>miracle</i> can restore former alignment, and the affected individual does not make any attempt to return to the former alignment. (In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any way possible.) If a character of a class with an alignment requirement is affected, an <i>atonement</i> spell is needed as well if the curse is to be obliterated. When a <i>helm of opposite alignment</i> has functioned once, it loses its magical properties.</p><p>Strong transmutation; CL 12th; Create Wondrous Item, creator must be 12th level; Price 4,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.</p><p><strong title="Incense of Obsession:">집착의 향료:</strong> These blocks of incense appear to be <i>incense of meditation.</i> If meditation and prayer are conducted while <i>incense of obsession</i> is burning nearby, its odor and smoke cause the user to become totally confident that her spell ability is superior, due to the magic incense. The user is determined to use her spells at every opportunity, even when not needed or when useless.

However, while the user thinks she is picking up the thoughts of others, all she is really hearing are figments created by the medallion itself. These illusory thoughts always seem plausible and thus can seriously mislead any who rely upon them. What’s worse, unknown to her, the cursed medallion actually broadcasts her thoughts to creatures in the path of the beam, thus alerting them to her presence.</p><p>Faint divination; CL 7th; Create Wondrous Item, <i>detect thoughts, ghost sound;</i> Price 1,800 gp.</p><p><strong title="Necklace of Strangulation:">교살의 목걸이:</strong> A <i>necklace of strangulation</i> appears to be a rare and wondrous piece of valuable jewelry and, short of the use of something as powerful as a <i>miracle</i> or a <i>wish</i>, can only be identified as a cursed item when placed around a character’s neck. The necklace immediately constricts, dealing 6 points of damage per round. It cannot be removed by any means short of a <i>limited wish, wish,</i> or <i>miracle</i> and remains clasped around the victim’s throat even after his death.

The periapt (and the affliction) can be removed only by application of a <i>remove curse</i> spell followed by a <i>cure disease</i> and then a <i>heal, miracle, limited wish</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell.

A DC 25 Reflex save allows the wearer to tear the scarab away before it burrows out of sight, but he still takes 3d6 points of damage. The beetle then returns to its scarab form.

The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation.</p><p><em title="Flames:">불:</em> Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity.

If the stone is broken open (break DC 20), a cavity is revealed at the stone’s heart. This cavity is lined with a magical type of quicksilver that enables any arcane spellcaster to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into silver and gold. A single <i>philosopher’s stone</i> can turn from up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver, or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold. However, the quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period.</p><p>The quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to another use.

The object is actually a hole in the continuity of the multiverse. Any matter that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void, gone, and utterly destroyed. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character.</p><p>A <i>sphere of annihilation</i> is static, resting in some spot as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of telekinesis, too weak to move actual objects but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character’s ability to gain control of a <i>sphere of annihilation</i> (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character Int modifier. If the check succeeds, the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action.</p><p>Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere’s speed in a round is 10 feet +5 feet for every 5 points by which the character’s control check result in that round exceeded 30.</p><p>If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it.</p><p>If two or more creatures vie for control of a <i>sphere of annihilation,</i> the rolls are opposed. If none are successful, the sphere slips toward the one who rolled lowest.</p><p>Should a <i>gate</i> spell be cast upon a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, there is a 50% chance (01–50 on d%) that the spell destroys it, a 35% chance (51–85) that the spell does nothing, and a 15% chance (86–100) that a gap is torn in the spatial fabric, catapulting everything within a 180-foot radius into another plane. If a <i>rod of cancellation</i> touches a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>,</p><p>they negate each other in a tremendous explosion.

If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy directed at its wielder, as a <i>rod of absorption</i> does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed (see below). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a <i>rod of absorption</i> does. (Thus, absorbing spells can be risky.)</p><p><em title="Retributive Strike:">보복 공격:</em> A <i>staff of the magi</i> can be broken for a retributive strike. Such an act must be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All charges in the staff are released in a 30-foot spread. All within 10 feet of the broken staff take hit points of damage equal to 8 times the number of charges in the staff, those between 11 feet and 20 feet away take points equal to 6 times the number of charges, and those 21 feet to 30 feet distant take 4 times the number of charges. A DC 17 Reflex save reduces damage by half. </p><p>The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance (01–50 on d%) of traveling to another plane of existence, but if she does not (51–100), the explosive release of spell energy destroys her.

The intended victim is swallowed up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman must be good, and if he is not exceptionally pure in thought and deed the evil character gains a DC 19 Reflex saving throw to leap away from the crack.

Discarding or destroying it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman. </p><p>If he succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a <i>wish</i> is made with it, whichever comes first. It then disappears.</p><p>If he rolls a natural 20, the character finds it impossible to be rid of the talisman for as many months as he has points of Charisma. In addition, the artifact grants him one <i>wish</i> for every 6 points of the character’s Charisma. It also grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no avail.)</p><p>Regardless of which reaction results, a <i>talisman of reluctant wishes</i> disappears when its time period expires, leaving behind a 10,000 gp diamond in its stead.</p><p>Strong conjuration; CL 20th;Weight 1 lb.</p><p><strong title="Talisman of Ultimate Evil:">궁극 악의 부적:</strong> An evil (LE, NE, CE) divine spellcaster who possesses this item can cause a flaming crack to open at the feet of a good (LG, NG, CG) divine spellcaster who is up to 100 feet away. The intended victim is swallowed up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman must be evil, and if she is not exceptionally foul and perverse in the sights of her evil deity the good character gains a DC 19 Reflex save to leap away from the crack. Obviously, the target must be standing on solid ground for this item to function. </p><p>A <i>talisman of ultimate evil</i> has 6 charges. If a neutral (LN, N, CN) divine spellcaster touches one of these stones, she takes 6d6 points of damage. If a good divine spellcaster touches one, she takes 8d6 points of damage. All other characters are unaffected by the device. </p><p>Strong evocation [evil]; CL 18th.</p></section></section><section id="h2-15-major-artifacts"><h2 title="MAJOR ARTIFACTS">상급 유물</h2><p>Major artifacts are unique items—only one of each such item exists. These are the most potent of magic items, capable of altering the balance of a campaign.</p><p>Unlike all other magic items, major artifacts are not easily destroyed. Each should have only a single, specific means of destruction.</p><section id="h3-16-major-artifact-descriptions"><h3 title="Major Artifact Descriptions">상급 유물 설명</h3><p><strong title="The Moaning Diamond:">신음하는 다이아몬드:</strong> The <i>Moaning Diamond</i> appears to be an uncut diamond the size of a human fist. At all times, it gives forth a baleful moaning sound, as if in pain. Despite the noise, the <i>Moaning Diamond</i> is not evil. The wielder of the stone can, three times per day, call upon it to reshape earth and stone as if by the spell <i>stone shape,</i> affecting 5,000 cubic feet of material. The <i>Moaning Diamond</i> can summon an elder earth elemental with maximum hit points that serves the caster until it is slain. Only one such elemental can be summoned at a time; if it is slain, a new creature cannot be summoned for 24 hours. </p><p><strong title="The Orbs of Dragonkind:">드래곤류의 구슬:</strong> Each of these fabled orbs contains the essence and personality of an ancient dragon of a different variety (one for each of the major ten different chromatic and metallic dragons). The bearer of an <i>Orb</i> can <i>dominate</i> dragons of its particular variety within 500 feet (as <i>dominate monster</i>), the dragon being forced to make a DC 25 Will save to resist. (Spell resistance is not useful against this effect.) Each <i>Orb of Dragonkind</i> bestows upon the wielder the AC and saving throw bonuses of the dragon within. These values replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether they are better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character of the <i>Orb.</i> A character possessing an <i>Orb of Dragonkind</i> is immune to the breath weapon—but only the breath weapon—of the dragon variety keyed to the <i>Orb.</i> Finally, a character possessing an <i>Orb</i> can herself use the breath weapon of the dragon in the <i>Orb</i> three times per day.</p><p>All <i>Orbs of Dragonkind</i> can be used to communicate verbally and visually with the possessors of the other <i>Orbs.</i> The owner of an <i>Orb</i> knows whether there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For dragons of the <i>Orb</i>’s particular variety, the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the <i>Orb</i>’s variety, the wielder can determine the exact location and age of the creature. The bearer of one of these <i>Orbs</i> earns the enmity forever of all dragonkind for profiting by the enslavement of one of their kin, even if she later loses the item. </p><p>Each <i>Orb</i> also has an individual power that can be invoked once per round at 10th caster level.</p><p>• <i>Black Dragon Orb: Fly</i> (Will DC 17 negates).</p><p>• <i>Blue Dragon Orb: Haste</i> (Fortitude DC 17 negates).</p><p>• <i>Brass Dragon Orb: Teleport</i> (Will DC 19 negates).</p><p>• <i>Bronze Dragon Orb: Scrying</i> (Will DC 18 negates).</p><p>• <i>Copper Dragon Orb: Suggestion</i> (Will DC 17 negates).</p><p>• <i>Gold Dragon Orb:</i> The owner of the gold <i>Orb</i> can call upon any power possessed by one of the other <i>Orbs</i>—including the <i>dominate</i> and breath weapon abilities but not AC, save bonuses, or breath weapon immunity—but can only use an individual</p><p>power once per day. She can use <i>dominate</i> on any other possessor of an <i>Orb</i> within 1 mile (Will DC 23 negates).</p><p>• <i>Green Dragon Orb: Spectral hand.</i></p><p>• <i>Red Dragon Orb: Wall of fire.</i></p><p>• <i>Silver Dragon Orb: Cure critical wounds</i> (Will DC 18 half ).</p><p>• <i>White Dragon Orb: Protection from energy (cold)</i> (Fortitude DC 17 negates).</p><p><strong title="The Saint’s Mace:">성인의 철퇴:</strong> This relic appears to be a simple, well-used cudgel, but its simple appearance hides great power. The <i>saint’s mace</i> has a +5 enhancement bonus and functions as a heavy mace with the holy, lawful, and disruption special abilities. The wielder can project <i>searing light</i> from the mace at will, at caster level 20th.</p><p><strong title="The Shadowstaff:">그림자 지팡이:</strong> This artifact was crafted centuries ago, weaving together the wispy strands of shadow itself into a twisted black staff. The <i>Shadowstaff</i> makes the wielder slightly shadowy and incorporeal, granting him a +4 bonus to AC and Reflex saves (which stacks with any other bonuses). However, in bright light (such as that of the sun, but not a torch) or in absolute darkness, the wielder takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. </p><p>The <i>Shadowstaff</i> also has these powers.</p><p>• <i>Summon Shadows:</i> Three times per day the staff may summon 2d4 shadows. Immune to turning, they serve the wielder as if called by a <i>summon monster V</i> spell cast at 20th level.</p><p>• <i>Summon Nightshade:</i> Once per month, the staff can summon a nightcrawler nightshade that serves the wielder as if called by a <i>summon monster IX</i> spell cast at 20th level.</p><p>• <i>Shadow Form:</i> Three times per day the wielder can become a living shadow, with all the movement powers granted by the</p><p><i>gaseous form</i> spell. </p><p>• <i>Shadow Bolt:</i> Three times per day the staff can project a ray attack that deals 10d6 points of cold damage to a single target. The shadow bolt has a range of 100 feet.</p><p>The Shield of the Sun: This <i>+5 large shield,</i> emblazoned with the symbol of the sun, allows the wielder to cast spells as if she were a 20th-level paladin with a Wisdom score of 20. The spells gained are cumulative with any existing spells per day that the character might have, even if she’s already a paladin. The <i>Shield of the Sun</i> also grants spell resistance 15 to its wielder. It absorbs the first 10 points of damage from any energy attack (fire, cold, acid, electricity, or sonic). In return for all this, once per year the shield’s owner must undertake a quest (no saving throw to avoid) at the behest of a lawful good deity. </p><p>A character who is evil or chaotic (LE, NE, CE, CN, CG) gains four negative levels if she attempts to use this artifact. Although these negative levels never results in actual level loss, they remain as long as the shield is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including <i>restoration</i> spells). The negative levels disappear when the shield is stowed or leaves the wearer’s possession.</p></section></section></section></div></main></div><nav class="Layout_sidebar__2Jy-3"><div><div
