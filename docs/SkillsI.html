        <h2>스킬 개요</h2>
        <div class="original-headline">SKILLS SUMMARY</div>
        <p>
          If you buy a class skill, your character gets 1 rank (equal to a +1 보너스 on checks with that skill) for each
          skill point. If you buy other classes’ 스킬(cross-직업 스킬), you get 1/2 rank per skill point.
        </p>
        <p>Your maximum rank in a class skill is your character 레벨 + 3.</p>
        <p>Your maximum rank in a cross-class skill is one-half of this number (do not round up or down).</p>
        <p>
          <b>스킬 사용하기:</b
          ><span>
            To make a skill check, roll: 1d20 + skill 수정치 (Skill 수정치 = skill rank + 능력 수정치 + 기타
            수정치)</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          This roll works just like an 명중 굴림 or a 내성 굴림— the higher the roll, the better. Either you’re trying
          to match or exceed a certain 난이도 등급(DC), or you’re trying to beat another character의 check result.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>스킬 등급:</b
          ><span>
            A character의 number of ranks in a skill is based on how many skill points a character has invested in a
            skill. Many 스킬 can be used even if the character has no ranks in them; doing this is called making an
            untrained skill check.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>능력 수정치:</b
          ><span>
            The 능력 수정치 used in a skill check is the 수정치 for the skill의 핵심 능력(the ability associated with
            the skill의 use). 핵심 능력 of each skill is noted in its 묘사.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>기타 수정치:</b
          ><span> 기타 수정치 include racial 보너스, 갑옷 판정 페널티, and 보너스 provided by 특기, among others.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Each skill point you spend on a class skill gets you 1 rank in that skill. 직업 스킬 are 스킬 found on your
          character의 class skill list. Each skill point you spend on a cross-class skill gets your character 1/2 rank
          in that skill. Cross-직업 스킬 are 스킬 not found on your character의 class skill list. (Half ranks do not
          improve your skill check, but two 1/2 ranks make 1 rank.) You can’t save skill points to spend later.
        </p>
        <p>
          The maximum rank in a class skill is the character의 레벨 + 3. If it의 a cross-class skill, the maximum rank
          is half of that number (do not round up or down).
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless of whether a skill is purchased as a class skill or a cross-class skill, if it is a class skill for
          any of your classes, your maximum rank equals your total character 레벨 + 3.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="h2-2-using-skills">
        <h2>스킬 사용하기</h2>
        <div class="original-headline">USING SKILLS</div>
        <p>
          When your character uses a skill, you make a skill check to see how well he or she does. The higher the result
          of the skill check, the better. Based on the circumstances, your result must match or beat a particular number
          (a DC or the result of an opposed skill check) for the check to be successful. The harder the task, the higher
          the number you need to roll.
        </p>
        <p>
          Circumstances can affect your check. A character who is free to work without distractions can make a careful
          attempt and avoid simple mistakes. A character who has lots of time can try over and over again, thereby
          assuring the best outcome. If others help, the character may succeed where otherwise he or she would fail.
        </p>
        <section id="h3-3-skill-checks">
          <h3>스킬 판정</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">SKILL CHECKS</div>
          <p>
            A skill check takes into account a character의 training (skill rank), natural talent (능력 수정치), and luck
            (the die roll). It may also take into account his or her race의 knack for doing certain things (racial
            보너스) or what 갑옷 he or she is wearing (갑옷 판정 페널티), or a certain feat the character possesses,
            among other things.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make a skill check, roll 1d20 and add your character의 skill 수정치 for that skill. The skill 수정치
            incorporates the character의 ranks in that skill and the 능력 수정치 for that skill의 핵심 능력, plus any
            other 기타 수정치 that may apply, including racial 보너스 and 갑옷 판정 페널티. The higher the result, the
            better. Unlike with 명중 굴림 and 내성 굴림, a natural roll of 20 on the d20 is not an automatic success,
            and a natural roll of 1 is not an automatic failure.
          </p>
          <section id="h5-4-difficulty-class">
            <h5>난이도 등급</h5>
            <div class="original-headline">Difficulty Class</div>
            <p>
              Some checks are made against a 난이도 등급(DC). The DC is a number (set using the skill rules as a
              guideline) that you must score as a result on your skill check in order to succeed.

            <p>
              An opposed check is a check whose success or failure is determined by comparing the check result to
              another character의 check result. In an opposed check, the higher result succeeds, while the lower result
              fails. In case of a tie, the higher skill 수정치 wins. If these scores are the same, roll again to break
              the tie.

              In general, you can try a skill check again if you fail, and you can keep trying indefinitely. Some 스킬,
              however, have consequences of failure that must be taken into account. A few 스킬 are virtually useless
              once a check has failed on an attempt to accomplish a particular task. For most 스킬, when a character has
              succeeded once at a given task, additional successes are meaningless.

            <p>
              Generally, if your character attempts to use a skill he or she does not possess, you make a skill check as
              normal. The skill 수정치 doesn’t have a skill rank added in because the character has no ranks in the
              skill. Any other applicable 수정치, such as the 수정치 for the skill의 핵심 능력, are applied to the
              check.
            </p>
            <p>Many 스킬 can be used only by someone who is trained in them.</p>

            <div class="original-headline">Favorable and Unfavorable Conditions</div>
            <p>
              Some situations may make a skill easier or harder to use, resulting in 보너스 or 페널티 to the skill
              수정치 for a skill check or a change to the DC of the skill check.
            </p>
            <p>The chance of success can be altered in four ways to take into account exceptional circumstances.</p>
            <p>
              1. Give the skill user a +2 circumstance 보너스 to represent 상태이상 that improve performance, such as
              having the perfect tool for the job, getting help from another character (see 스킬 시도를 조합하기), or
              possessing unusually accurate information.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Give the skill user a –2 circumstance 페널티 to represent 상태이상 that hamper performance, such as
              being forced to use improvised tools or having misleading information.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Reduce the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task easier, such as having a friendly
              audience or doing work that can be subpar.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Increase the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task harder, such as having an
              uncooperative audience or doing work that must be flawless.
            </p>
            <p>
              상태이상 that affect your character의 ability to 공연 the skill change the skill 수정치. 상태이상 that
              modify how well the character has to 공연 the skill to succeed change the DC. 보너스 to the skill 수정치
              and a reduction in the check의 DC have the same result: They create a better chance of success. But they
              represent different circumstances, and sometimes that difference is important.

              Using a skill might take a round, take no time, or take several rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are
              표준 행동, 이동 행동, or 전체 라운드 행동. Types of actions define how long activities take to 공연 within
              the framework of a 전투 round (6 seconds) and how 이동 is treated with respect to the activity. Some 스킬
              판정 are instant and represent reactions to an event, or are included as part of an action.

            <p>
              A skill check represents an attempt to accomplish some goal, usually while under some sort of time
              pressure or distraction. Sometimes, though, a character can use a skill under more favorable 상태이상 and
              eliminate the luck factor.

                rolling 1d20 for the skill check, calculate your result as if you had rolled a 10. For many routine
                tasks, 10 받기 makes them automatically successful. Distractions or threats (such as 전투) make it
                impossible for a character to take 10. In most cases, 10 받기 is purely a safety measure —you know (or
                expect) that an average roll will succeed but 공포 that a poor roll might fail, so you elect to settle
                for the average roll (a 10). 10 받기 is especially useful in situations where a particularly high roll
                wouldn’t help.</span

                skill being attempted carries no 페널티 for failure, you can take 20. In other words, eventually you
                will get a 20 on 1d20 if you roll enough times. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, just
                calculate your result as if you had rolled a 20.</span

              20 받기 means you are trying until you get it right, and it assumes that you fail many times before

            </p>
            <p>
              Since 20 받기 assumes that the character will fail many times before succeeding, if you did attempt to
              take 20 on a skill that carries 페널티 for failure, your character would automatically incur those 페널티
              before he or she could complete the task. Common “take 20” 스킬 include 탈출 전문가, 자물쇠 열기, and

              You can help another character achieve success on his or her skill check by making the same kind of skill
              check in a cooperative effort. If you roll a 10 or higher on your check, the character you are helping
              gets a +2 보너스 to his or her check, as per the rule for favorable 상태이상. (You can’t take 10 on a
              skill check to 보조하기.) In many cases, a character의 help won’t be beneficial, or only a limited number
              of characters can help at once.

            <b>판정:</b
            ><span>
              A 허세 check is opposed by the target의 의도 파악 check. See the accompanying table for examples of
              different kinds of 허세 and the 수정치 to the target의 의도 파악 check for each one.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome of a 허세. Two circumstances can weigh
            against you: 허세 is hard to believe, or the action that the target is asked to take goes against its
            self-interest, nature, personality, orders, or the like. If it의 important, you can distinguish between a
            허세 that fails because the target doesn’t believe it and one that fails because it just asks too much of
            the target. For instance, if the target gets a +10 보너스 on its 의도 파악 check because 허세 요구 something
            risky, and 의도 파악 check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didn’t so much see through 허세 as prove
            reluctant to go along with it. A target that succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the 허세.
          </p>
          <p>
            A successful 허세 check indicates that the target reacts as you 소원, at least for a short time (usually 1
            round or less) or believes something that you want it to believe. 허세, however, is not a
            <i>제안 </i>spell.
          </p>
          <p>A 허세 requires interaction between you and the target. Creatures unaware of you cannot be bluffed.</p>
          <p>
            <i>전투 중 속임동작: </i
            ><span
              >You can also use 허세 to 오도 an opponent in melee 전투(so that it can’t 회피 your next 공격
              effectively). To 속임동작, make a 허세 check opposed by your target의 의도 파악 check, but in this case,
              the target may add its 기본 공격 보너스 to the roll along with any other applicable 수정치.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            If your 허세 check result exceeds this special 의도 파악 check result, your target is denied its 민첩 보너스
            to AC (if any) for the next melee 공격 you make against it. This 공격 must be made on or before your next
            turn.

            Feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult because it의 harder to read a strange creature의
            body language; you take a –4 페널티 on your 허세 check. Against a creature of animal 지능(1 or 2) it의 even
            harder; you take a –8 페널티. Against a nonintelligent creature, it의 impossible.

              Failure by 4 or less means you can’t get 통보 across. Failure by 5 or more means that some false
              information has been implied or inferred. Anyone listening to the exchange can make a 의도 파악 check

              Varies. A 허세 check made as part of general interaction always takes at least 1 round (and is at least a
              full-round action), but it can take much longer if you try something elaborate. A 허세 check made to
              속임동작 in 전투 or create a diversion to 숨기 is a standard action. A 허세 check made to deliver a secret
              통보 doesn’t take an action; it is part of normal communication.</span

              Varies. Generally, a failed 허세 check in social interaction makes the target too suspicious for you to
              try again in the same circumstances, but you may retry freely on 허세 checks made to 속임동작 in 전투.
              Retries are also allowed when you are trying to send a 통보, but you may attempt such a retry only once

              You must make a 집중 check whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking 피해, by harsh 날씨,
              and so on) while engaged in some action that requires your full attention. Such actions include casting a
              spell, concentrating on an active spell, directing a spell, using a 유사주문 ability, or using a skill
              that would provoke an 공격 of opportunity. In general, if an action wouldn’t normally provoke an 공격 of
              opportunity, you need not make a 집중 check to avoid being distracted.</span

            If 집중 check succeeds, you may continue with the action as normal. If the check fails, the action
            automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of casting a spell, the spell is lost. If you
            were concentrating on an active spell, the spell ends as if you had ceased concentrating on it. If you were
            directing a spell, the direction fails but the spell remains active. If you were using a 유사주문 ability,
            that use of the ability is lost. A skill use also fails, and in some cases a failed skill check may have
            other ramifications as well.

            The table below summarizes various types of distractions that cause you to make a 집중 check. If the
            distraction occurs while you are trying to 주문 시전, you must add 레벨 of the spell you are trying to cast
            to the appropriate 집중 DC. If more than one type of distraction is present, make a check for each one; any
            failed 집중 check indicates that the task is not completed.

              You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about half your check result in gold pieces
              per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to 공연 제작의 daily tasks,
              how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants

            The basic function of 제작 skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC
            depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check results, and the price of the item
            determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item의 finished price also determines the cost of
            raw materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, the <i>제조 </i>spell can be used to achieve the results of a 제작 check with no actual check
            involved. However, you must make an appropriate 제작 check when using the spell to make articles requiring a
            high degree of craftsmanship.
          </p>
          <p>
            A successful 제작 check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the
            <i>강철나무 </i>spell enables you to make wooden items that have 근력 of steel.
          </p>
          <p>
            When casting the spell <i>하급 창조</i>, you must succeed on an appropriate 제작 check to make a complex
            item.
          </p>
          <p>
            All 제작 require artisan의 tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check
            is made with a –2 circumstance 페널티. On the other hand, 명품 artisan의 tools provide a +2 circumstance
            보너스 on the check.
          </p>
          <p>To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.</p>
          <p>1. Find the item의 price. Put the price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).</p>
          <p>2. Find the DC from the table below.</p>
          <p>3. Pay one-third of the item의 price for the cost of raw materials.</p>
          <p>
            4. Make an appropriate 제작 check representing one week의 work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check
            result by the DC. If the result × the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the
            item. (If the result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you’ve
            completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the
            same manner.) If the result × the DC doesn’t equal the price, then it represents the progress you’ve made
            this week. Record the result and make a new 제작 check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress
            until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces.
          </p>
          <p>If you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week.</p>
          <p>
            If you fail by 5 or more, you 파멸 half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material
            cost again.

          <p>
            The DC depends on how tricky the device is. Disabling (or rigging or jamming) a fairly simple device has a
            DC of 10; more intricate and complex devices have higher DCs.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the check succeeds, you 행동불능화 the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try
            again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you spring it. If you’re
            attempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is 행동 불능, but it still works normally.
          </p>
          <p>
            You also can rig simple devices such as saddles or wagon wheels to work normally for a while and then fail
            or fall off some time later (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use).

            Usually, an individual makes a 감지 check to see through your 변장 immediately upon meeting you and each
            hour thereafter. If you casually meet many different creatures, each for a short time, check once per day or
            hour, using an average 감지 수정치 for the group.

              위조 requires writing materials appropriate to the document being forged, enough 빛 or sufficient visual
              acuity to see the details of what you’re writing, wax for seals (if appropriate), and some time. To forge
              a document on which the handwriting is not specific to a person (military orders, a government decree, a
              business ledger, or the like), you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain a +8
              보너스 on your check. To forge a signature, you need an autograph of that person to copy, and you gain a
              +4 보너스 on the check. To forge a longer document written in the hand of some particular person, a large
              sample of that person의 handwriting is needed.</span

            위조 check is made secretly, so that you’re not sure how good your 위조 is. As with 변장, you don’t even
            need to make a check until someone examines the work. Your 위조 check is opposed by 위조 check of the person
            who examines the document to check its authenticity. The examiner gains 수정치 on his or her check if any of
            상태이상 on the table below exist.

            animal to 공격, and it will comply if able. Normally, an animal will 공격 only humanoids, monstrous
            humanoids, 거인, or other animals. Teaching an animal to 공격 all creatures (including such unnatural
            creatures as undead and aberrations) counts as two tricks.

          <p>
            Defend (DC 20): The animal defends you (or is 준비 to defend you if no threat is present), even without any
            명령 being given. Alternatively, you can 명령 the animal to defend a specific other character.
          </p>
          <p>
            Down (DC 15): The animal breaks off from 전투 or otherwise backs down. An animal that doesn’t know this
            trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a 공포 effect, or the like) or its opponent is
            defeated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fetch (DC 15): The animal goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the animal
            fetches some random object.
          </p>
          <p>Guard (DC 20): The animal stays in place and prevents others from approaching.</p>
          <p>Heel (DC 15): The animal follows you closely, even to places where it normally wouldn’t go.</p>
          <p>
            공연(DC 15): The animal 공연 a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or
            barking, and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seek (DC 15): The animal 이동 into an 범위 and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stay (DC 15): The animal stays in place, waiting for you to return. It does not challenge other creatures
            that come by,

          <p>추적(DC 20): The animal 추적 냄새 presented to it. (This requires the animal to have 냄새 ability)</p>

            전투 Riding (DC 20): An animal trained to bear a rider into 전투 knows the tricks 공격, come, defend, down,
            guard, and heel. Training an animal for 전투 riding takes six weeks. You may also “upgrade” an animal
            trained for riding to one trained for 전투 riding by spending three weeks and making a successful DC 20 동물
            조련 check. The new general 목적 and tricks completely replace the animal의 previous 목적 and any tricks it
            once knew. Warhorses and riding 개 are already trained to bear riders into 전투, and they don’t require any
            additional training for this 목적.

Many 스킬 can be used even if the character has no ranks in them; doing this is called making an\n            untrained skill check.\u003c/span\n          \u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          \u003cb\u003e능력 수정치:\u003c/b\n          \u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n            The 능력 수정치 used in a skill check is the 수정치 for the skill의 핵심 능력(the ability associated with\n            the skill의 use). 핵심 능력 of each skill is noted in its 묘사.\u003c/span\n          \u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          \u003cb\u003e기타 수정치:\u003c/b\n          \u003e\u003cspan\u003e 기타 수정치 include racial 보너스, 갑옷 판정 페널티, and 보너스 provided by 특기, among others.\u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          Each skill point you spend on a class skill gets you 1 rank in that skill. 직업 스킬 are 스킬 found on your\n          character의 class skill list. Each skill point you spend on a cross-class skill gets your character 1/2 rank\n          in that skill. Cross-직업 스킬 are 스킬 not found on your character의 class skill list. (Half ranks do not\n          improve your skill check, but two 1/2 ranks make 1 rank.) You can’t save skill points to spend later.\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          The maximum rank in a class skill is the character의 레벨 + 3.

The higher the result\n          of the skill check, the better. Based on the circumstances, your result must match or beat a particular number\n          (a DC or the result of an opposed skill check) for the check to be successful. The harder the task, the higher\n          the number you need to roll.\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          Circumstances can affect your check. A character who is free to work without distractions can make a careful\n          attempt and avoid simple mistakes. A character who has lots of time can try over and over again, thereby\n          assuring the best outcome. If others help, the character may succeed where otherwise he or she would fail.\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003csection id=\"h3-3-skill-checks\"\u003e\n          \u003ch3\u003e스킬 판정\u003c/h3\u003e\n          \u003cdiv class=\"original-headline\"\u003eSKILL CHECKS\u003c/div\u003e\n          \u003cp\u003e\n            A skill check takes into account a character의 training (skill rank), natural talent (능력 수정치), and luck\n            (the die roll). It may also take into account his or her race의 knack for doing certain things (racial\n            보너스) or what 갑옷 he or she is wearing (갑옷 판정 페널티), or a certain feat the character possesses,\n            among other things.\n          \u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003cp\u003e\n            To make a skill check, roll 1d20 and add your character의 skill 수정치 for that skill. The skill 수정치\n            incorporates the character의 ranks in that skill and the 능력 수정치 for that skill의 핵심 능력, plus any\n            other 기타 수정치 that may apply, including racial 보너스 and 갑옷 판정 페널티. The higher the result, the\n            better. Unlike with 명중 굴림 and 내성 굴림, a natural roll of 20 on the d20 is not an automatic success,\n            and a natural roll of 1 is not an automatic failure.\n          \u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003csection id=\"h5-4-difficulty-class\"\u003e\n            \u003ch5\u003e난이도 등급\u003c/h5\u003e\n            \u003cdiv class=\"original-headline\"\u003eDifficulty Class\u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003e\n              Some checks are made against a 난이도 등급(DC).
