If you buy other classes’ skills (cross-class skills), you get 1/2 rank per skill point.</p><p>Your maximum rank in a class skill is your character level + 3.</p><p>Your maximum rank in a cross-class skill is one-half of this number (do not round up or down).</p><p><strong>스킬 사용하기:</strong> To make a skill check, roll: 1d20 + skill modifier (Skill modifier = skill rank + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers)</p><p>This roll works just like an attack roll or a saving throw— the higher the roll, the better. Either you’re trying to match or exceed a certain Difficulty Class (DC), or you’re trying to beat another character’s check result.</p><p><strong>스킬 등급:</strong> A character’s number of ranks in a skill is based on how many skill points a character has invested in a skill. Many skills can be used even if the character has no ranks in them; doing this is called making an untrained skill check.</p><p><strong>능력 수정치:</strong> The ability modifier used in a skill check is the modifier for the skill’s key ability (the ability associated with the skill’s use). The key ability of each skill is noted in its description.</p><p><strong>기타 수정치:</strong> Miscellaneous modifiers include racial bonuses, armor check penalties, and bonuses provided by feats, among others.</p><p>Each skill point you spend on a class skill gets you 1 rank in that skill. Class skills are the skills found on your character’s class skill list. Each skill point you spend on a cross-class skill gets your character 1/2 rank in that skill. Cross-class skills are skills not found on your character’s class skill list. (Half ranks do not improve your skill check, but two 1/2 ranks make 1 rank.) You can’t save skill points to spend later.</p><p>The maximum rank in a class skill is the character’s level + 3. If it’s a cross-class skill, the maximum rank is half of that number (do not round up or down).</p><p>Regardless of whether a skill is purchased as a class skill or a cross-class skill, if it is a class skill for any of your classes, your maximum rank equals your total character level + 3.</p></section><section id="h1-2-using-skills"><h1>스킬 사용하기</h1><p>When your character uses a skill, you make a skill check to see how well he or she does. The higher the result of the skill check, the better. Based on the circumstances, your result must match or beat a particular number (a DC or the result of an opposed skill check) for the check to be successful. The harder the task, the higher the number you need to roll.</p><p>Circumstances can affect your check. A character who is free to work without distractions can make a careful attempt and avoid simple mistakes. A character who has lots of time can try over and over again, thereby assuring the best outcome. If others help, the character may succeed where otherwise he or she would fail.</p><section id="h2-3-skill-checks"><h2>스킬 판정</h2><p>A skill check takes into account a character’s training (skill rank), natural talent (ability modifier), and luck (the die roll). It may also take into account his or her race’s knack for doing certain things (racial bonus) or what armor he or she is wearing (armor check penalty), or a certain feat the character possesses, among other things. </p><p>To make a skill check, roll 1d20 and add your character’s skill modifier for that skill. The skill modifier incorporates the character’s ranks in that skill and the ability modifier for that skill’s key ability, plus any other miscellaneous modifiers that may apply, including racial bonuses and armor check penalties. The higher the result, the better. Unlike with attack rolls and saving throws, a natural roll of 20 on the d20 is not an automatic success, and a natural roll of 1 is not an automatic failure.</p><section id="h5-4-difficulty-class"><h5>난이도</h5><p>Some checks are made against a Difficulty Class (DC).

If these scores are the same, roll again to break the tie.</p><div class="table-container"><table><caption>Table: Example Opposed Checks</caption><tbody><tr><th style="min-width: 12.975em;">작업</th><th style="min-width: 10.725em;">스킬 (핵심 능력)</th><th style="min-width: 13.725em;">반대 스킬 (핵심 능력)</th></tr><tr><td>건 someone</td><td>허세 (매)</td><td>의도 파악 (혜)</td></tr><tr><td>Pretend to be someone else</td><td>변장 (매)</td><td>감지 (혜)</td></tr><tr><td>Create a false map</td><td>위조 (지)</td><td>위조 (지)</td></tr><tr><td>숨기 from someone</td><td>숨기 (민)</td><td>감지 (혜)</td></tr><tr><td>Make a bully back down</td><td>위협 (매)</td><td>특수<sup>1</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Sneak up on someone</td><td>조용히 이동 (민)</td><td>듣기 (혜)</td></tr><tr><td>Steal a coin pouch</td><td>날렵한 손재주 (민)</td><td>감지 (혜)</td></tr><tr><td>Tie a prisoner securely</td><td>밧줄 사용 (민)</td><td>탈출 전문가 (민)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><sup>1</sup>위협 판정 is opposed by the target의 레벨 판정, not 스킬 판정.

Some skills, however, have consequences of failure that must be taken into account. A few skills are virtually useless once a check has failed on an attempt to accomplish a particular task. For most skills, when a character has succeeded once at a given task, additional successes are meaningless.</p></section><section id="h5-7-untrained-skill-checks"><h5>비훈련시 스킬 판정</h5><p>Generally, if your character attempts to use a skill he or she does not possess, you make a skill check as normal. The skill modifier doesn’t have a skill rank added in because the character has no ranks in the skill. Any other applicable modifiers, such as the modifier for the skill’s key ability, are applied to the check.</p><p>Many skills can be used only by someone who is trained in them.</p></section><section id="h5-8-favorable-and-unfavorable-conditions"><h5>호조건 및 악조건</h5><p>Some situations may make a skill easier or harder to use, resulting in a bonus or penalty to the skill modifier for a skill check or a change to the DC of the skill check.</p><p>The chance of success can be altered in four ways to take into account exceptional circumstances.</p><p>1. Give the skill user a +2 circumstance bonus to represent conditions that improve performance, such as having the perfect tool for the job, getting help from another character (see Combining Skill Attempts), or possessing unusually accurate information. </p><p>2. Give the skill user a –2 circumstance penalty to represent conditions that hamper performance, such as being forced to use improvised tools or having misleading information.</p><p>3. Reduce the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task easier, such as having a friendly audience or doing work that can be subpar.</p><p>4. Increase the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task harder, such as having an uncooperative audience or doing work that must be flawless.</p><p>Conditions that affect your character’s ability to perform the skill change the skill modifier. Conditions that modify how well the character has to perform the skill to succeed change the DC. A bonus to the skill modifier and a reduction in the check’s DC have the same result: They create a better chance of success. But they represent different circumstances, and sometimes that difference is important.</p></section><section id="h5-9-time-and-skill-checks"><h5>시간 및 스킬 판정</h5><p>Using a skill might take a round, take no time, or take several rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are standard actions, move actions, or full-round actions. Types of actions define how long activities take to perform within the framework of a combat round (6 seconds) and how movement is treated with respect to the activity. Some skill checks are instant and represent reactions to an event, or are included as part of an action.</p><p>These skill checks are not actions. Other skill checks represent part of movement.</p></section><section id="h5-10-checks-without-rolls"><h5>굴림 없이 판정</h5><p>A skill check represents an attempt to accomplish some goal, usually while under some sort of time pressure or distraction. Sometimes, though, a character can use a skill under more favorable conditions and eliminate the luck factor.</p><p><strong>10 받기:</strong> When your character is not being threatened or distracted, you may choose to take 10. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, calculate your result as if you had rolled a 10. For many routine tasks, taking 10 makes them automatically successful. Distractions or threats (such as combat) make it impossible for a character to take 10. In most cases, taking 10 is purely a safety measure —you know (or expect) that an average roll will succeed but fear that a poor roll might fail, so you elect to settle for the average roll (a 10). Taking 10 is especially useful in situations where a particularly high roll wouldn’t help.</p><p><strong>20 받기:</strong>When you have plenty of time (generally 2 minutes for a skill that can normally be checked in 1 round, one full-round action, or one standard action), you are faced with no threats or distractions, and the skill being attempted carries no penalties for failure, you can take 20. In other words, eventually you will get a 20 on 1d20 if you roll enough times. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, just calculate your result as if you had rolled a 20.</p><p>Taking 20 means you are trying until you get it right, and it assumes that you fail many times before succeeding. Taking 20 takes twenty times as long as making a single check would take.</p><p>Since taking 20 assumes that the character will fail many times before succeeding, if you did attempt to take 20 on a skill that carries penalties for failure, your character would automatically incur those penalties before he or she could complete the task. Common “take 20” skills include Escape Artist, Open Lock, and Search.</p><p><strong>능력 판정과 시전자 레벨 판정:</strong> The normal take 10 and take 20 rules apply for ability checks. Neither rule applies to caster level checks.</p></section></section><section id="h2-11-combining-skill-attempts"><h2>스킬 시도를 조합하기</h2><p>When more than one character tries the same skill at the same time and for the same purpose, their efforts may overlap.</p><section id="h5-12-individual-events"><h5>개별 사건</h5><p>Often, several characters attempt some action and each succeeds or fails independently. The result of one character’s Climb check does not influence the results of other characters Climb check.</p></section><section id="h5-13-aid-another"><h5>타인 보조하기</h5><p>You can help another character achieve success on his or her skill check by making the same kind of skill check in a cooperative effort. If you roll a 10 or higher on your check, the character you are helping gets a +2 bonus to his or her check, as per the rule for favorable conditions. (You can’t take 10 on a skill check to aid another.) In many cases, a character’s help won’t be beneficial, or only a limited number of characters can help at once. </p><p>In cases where the skill restricts who can achieve certain results you can’t aid another to grant a bonus to a task that your character couldn’t achieve alone.</p></section><section id="h5-14-skill-synergy"><h5>스킬 시너지</h5><p>It’s possible for a character to have two skills that work well together. In general, having 5 or more ranks in one skill gives the character a +2 bonus on skill checks with each of its synergistic skills, as noted in the skill description. In some cases, this bonus applies only to specific uses of the skill in question, and not to all checks. Some skills provide benefits on other checks made by a character, such as those checks required to use certain class features.</p></section></section><section id="h2-15-ability-checks"><h2>능력 판정</h2><p>Sometimes a character tries to do something to which no specific skill really applies. In these cases, you make an ability check. An ability check is a roll of 1d20 plus the appropriate ability modifier. Essentially, you’re making an untrained skill check. </p><p>In some cases, an action is a straight test of one’s ability with no luck involved. Just as you wouldn’t make a height check to see who is taller, you don’t make a Strength check to see who is stronger.</p></section></section><section id="h1-16-skill-descriptions"><h1>스킬 설명</h1><p>This section describes each skill, including common uses and typical modifiers. Characters can sometimes use skills for purposes other than those noted here.</p><p>Here is the format for skill descriptions.</p><section id="h2-17-skill-name"><h2>스킬 이름</h2><p>The skill name line includes (in addition to the name of the skill) the following information.</p><p><strong>핵심 능력:</strong> The abbreviation of the ability whose modifier applies to the skill check. <i>Exception:</i> Speak Language has “None” as its key ability because the use of this skill does not require a check.</p><p><strong>훈련 필요:</strong> If this notation is included in the skill name line, you must have at least 1 rank in the skill to use it.

After the description are a few other types of information:</p><p><strong>판정:</strong> What a character (“you” in the skill description) can do with a successful skill check and the check’s DC.</p><p><strong>행동:</strong> The type of action using the skill requires, or the amount of time required for a check.</p><p><strong>다시 시도하기:</strong> Any conditions that apply to successive attempts to use the skill successfully. If the skill doesn’t allow you to attempt the same task more than once, or if failure carries an inherent penalty (such as with the Climb skill), you can’t take 20. If this paragraph is omitted, the skill can be retried without any inherent penalty, other than the additional time required.</p><p><strong>특수:</strong> Any extra facts that apply to the skill, such as special effects deriving from its use or bonuses that certain characters receive because of class, feat choices, or race.</p><p><strong>시너지:</strong> Some skills grant a bonus to the use of one or more other skills because of a synergistic effect. This entry, when present, indicates what bonuses this skill may grant or receive because of such synergies. See Table 4–5 for a complete list of bonuses granted by synergy between skills (or between a skill and a class feature).</p><p><strong>제한사항:</strong> The full utility of certain skills is restricted to characters of certain classes or characters who possess certain feats. This entry indicates whether any such restrictions exist for the skill.</p><p><strong>비훈련시:</strong> This entry indicates what a character without at least 1 rank in the skill can do with it.

See the accompanying table for examples of different kinds of bluffs and the modifier to the target’s Sense Motive check for each one.</p><p>Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome of a bluff. Two circumstances can weigh against you: The bluff is hard to believe, or the action that the target is asked to take goes against its self-interest, nature, personality, orders, or the like. If it’s important, you can distinguish between a bluff that fails because the target doesn’t believe it and one that fails because it just asks too much of the target. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus on its Sense Motive check because the bluff demands something risky, and the Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didn’t so much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. A target that succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the bluff.</p><p>A successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as you wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less) or believes something that you want it to believe. Bluff, however, is not a <i>suggestion</i> spell. </p><p>A bluff requires interaction between you and the target. Creatures unaware of you cannot be bluffed.</p><p><em>전투 중 속임동작:</em> You can also use Bluff to mislead an opponent in melee combat (so that it can’t dodge your next attack effectively). To feint, make a Bluff check opposed by your target’s Sense Motive check, but in this case, the target may add its base attack bonus to the roll along with any other applicable modifiers.</p><p>If your Bluff check result exceeds this special Sense Motive check result, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for the next melee attack you make against it. This attack must be made on or before your next turn.</p><p>Feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult because it’s harder to read a strange creature’s body language; you take a –4 penalty on your Bluff check. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2) it’s even harder; you take a –8 penalty. Against a nonintelligent creature, it’s impossible.</p><p>Feinting in combat does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p><p><em>숨기 위해 주의 돌리기:</em> You can use the Bluff skill to help you hide. A successful Bluff check gives you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you. This usage does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p><p><em>비밀 메세지 전달하기:</em> You can use Bluff to get a message across to another character without others understanding it. The DC is 15 for simple messages, or 20 for complex messages, especially those that rely on getting across new information. Failure by 4 or less means you can’t get the message across. Failure by 5 or more means that some false information has been implied or inferred. Anyone listening to the exchange can make a Sense Motive check opposed by the Bluff check you made to transmit in order to intercept your message (see Sense Motive).</p><p><strong>행동:</strong> Varies. A Bluff check made as part of general interaction always takes at least 1 round (and is at least a full-round action), but it can take much longer if you try something elaborate. A Bluff check made to feint in combat or create a diversion to hide is a standard action. A Bluff check made to deliver a secret message doesn’t take an action; it is part of normal communication.</p><p><strong>다시 시도하기:</strong> Varies. Generally, a failed Bluff check in social interaction makes the target too suspicious for you to try again in the same circumstances, but you may retry freely on Bluff checks made to feint in combat. Retries are also allowed when you are trying to send a message, but you may attempt such a retry only once per round.</p><p>Each retry carries the same chance of miscommunication.</p><p><strong>특수:</strong> A ranger gains a bonus on Bluff checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.</p><p>The master of a snake familiar gains a +3 bonus on Bluff checks.</p><p>If you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Bluff checks.</p><p><strong>시너지:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sleight of Hand checks, as well as on Disguise checks made when you know you’re being observed and you try to act in character.</p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><th colspan="2">허세 예</th></tr><tr><th>예 상황</th><th>의도 파악 수정치</th></tr><tr><td>목표물 wants to believe you.</td><td>–5</td></tr><tr><td>허세 is believable 및 doesn’t affect 목표물 much.</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>허세 is a little hard to believe or puts 목표물 at some risk.</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>허세 is hard to believe or puts 목표물 at significant risk.</td><td>+10</td></tr><tr><td>허세 is way out there, almost too incredible to consider.</td><td>+20</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id="h2-21-climb-str-armor-check-penalty"><h2>등반<small>(근; 갑옷 판정 페널티)</small></h2><p><strong>판정:</strong> With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds) at one-quarter your normal speed. A slope is considered to be any incline at an angle measuring less than 60 degrees; a wall is any incline at an angle measuring 60 degrees or more.</p><p>A Climb check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained.</p><p>A climber’s kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks.</p><p>The DC of the check depends on the conditions of the climb.

Doing so takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per 3 feet of distance. As with any surface that offers handholds and footholds, a wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the same way, a climber with a handaxe or similar implement can cut handholds in an ice wall.</p><p><em>떨어질 때 무언가 잡기:</em> It’s practically impossible to catch yourself on a wall while falling. Make a Climb check (DC = wall’s DC + 20) to do so. It’s much easier to catch yourself on a slope (DC = slope’s DC + 10).</p><p><em>등반 중 떨어지는 캐릭터 잡기:</em> If someone climbing above you or adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch the falling character if he or she is within your reach. Doing so requires a successful melee touch attack against the falling character (though he or she can voluntarily forego any Dexterity bonus to AC if desired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC = wall’s DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling character, but his or her total weight, including equipment, cannot exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail your Climb check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character’s fall but don’t lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to stop the character’s fall and begin falling as well.</p><p><strong>행동:</strong> Climbing is part of movement, so it’s generally part of a move action (and may be combined with other types of movement in a move action). Each move action that includes any climbing requires a separate Climb check. Catching yourself or another falling character doesn’t take an action.</p><p><strong>특수:</strong> You can use a rope to haul a character upward (or lower a character) through sheer strength. You can lift double your maximum load in this manner.</p><p>A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Climb checks because halflings are agile and surefooted.</p><p>The master of a lizard familiar gains a +3 bonus on Climb checks.</p><p>If you have the Athletic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks.</p><p>A creature with a climb speed has a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. The creature must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC higher than 0, but it always can choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened while climbing. If a creature with a climb speed chooses an accelerated climb (see above), it moves at double its climb speed (or at its land speed, whichever is slower) and makes a single Climb check at a –5 penalty. Such a creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.</p><p><strong>시너지:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks made to climb a rope, a knotted rope, or a rope-and-wall combination.</p></section><section id="h2-22-concentration-con"><h2>집중<small>(건)</small></h2><p><strong>판정:</strong> You must make a Concentration check whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by harsh weather, and so on) while engaged in some action that requires your full attention. Such actions include casting a spell, concentrating on an active spell, directing a spell, using a spell-like ability, or using a skill that would provoke an attack of opportunity. In general, if an action wouldn’t normally provoke an attack of opportunity, you need not make a Concentration check to avoid being distracted.</p><p>If the Concentration check succeeds, you may continue with the action as normal. If the check fails, the action automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of casting a spell, the spell is lost. If you were concentrating on an active spell, the spell ends as if you had ceased concentrating on it. If you were directing a spell, the direction fails but the spell remains active. If you were using a spell-like ability, that use of the ability is lost. A skill use also fails, and in some cases a failed skill check may have other ramifications as well.</p><p>The table below summarizes various types of distractions that cause you to make a Concentration check.

You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill.</p><p>A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the heading of a Profession skill.</p><p><strong>판정:</strong> You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft’s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)</p><p>The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check results, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item’s finished price also determines the cost of raw materials.</p><p>In some cases, the <i>fabricate</i> spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. However, you must make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.</p><p>A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the <i>ironwood</i> spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.</p><p>When casting the spell <i>minor creation</i>, you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.</p><p>All crafts require artisan’s tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a –2 circumstance penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan’s tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.</p><p>To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.</p><p>1. Find the item’s price. Put the price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).</p><p>2. Find the DC from the table below.</p><p>3. Pay one-third of the item’s price for the cost of raw materials.</p><p>4. Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week’s work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result × the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you’ve completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result × the DC doesn’t equal the price, then it represents the progress you’ve made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces.</p><p>If you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week.</p><p>If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p><p><em>일일 진행도:</em> You can make checks by the day instead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result × DC) is in copper pieces instead of silver pieces.</p><p><em>명품 아이템 만들기:</em> You can make a masterwork item—a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship, not through being magical. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. <i>Note:</i> The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.</p><p><em>아이템 수리:</em> Generally, you can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place.

A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the spell level of the magic used to create it.</p><p>The spells <i>fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol,</i> and <i>teleportation circle</i> also create traps that a rogue can disarm with a successful Disable Device check. <i>Spike growth</i> and <i>spike stones,</i> however, create magic traps against which Disable Device checks do not succeed.

Failing that, it’s possible to plug up the holes from which the projectiles emerge. Doing this prevents the trap from firing unless its ammunition does enough damage to break through the plugs.</p><p><strong>근접 공격 함정:</strong> These devices can be thwarted by smashing the mechanism or blocking the weapons, as noted above. Alternatively, if a character studies the trap as it triggers, he might be able to time his dodges just right to avoid damage. A character who is doing nothing but studying a trap when it first goes off gains a +4 dodge bonus against its attacks if it is triggered again within the next minute.</p><p><strong>구덩이:</strong> Disabling a pit trap generally ruins only the trapdoor, making it an uncovered pit. Filling in the pit or building a makeshift bridge across it is an application of manual labor, not the Disable Device skill. Characters could neutralize any spikes at the bottom of a pit by attacking them—they break just as daggers do.</p><p><strong>마법 함정:</strong> <i>Dispel magic</i> helps here. Someone who succeeds on a caster level check against the level of the trap’s creator suppresses the trap for 1d4 rounds.

This category also covers making an animal perform a forced march or forcing it to hustle for more than 1 hour between sleep cycles. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2.

An animal with an Intelligence score of 1 can learn a maximum of three tricks, while an animal with an Intelligence score of 2 can learn a maximum of six tricks. Possible tricks (and their associated DCs) include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following.</p><p>Attack (DC 20): The animal attacks apparent enemies. You may point to a particular creature that you wish the animal to attack, and it will comply if able. Normally, an animal will attack only humanoids, monstrous humanoids, giants, or other animals. Teaching an animal to attack all creatures (including such unnatural creatures as undead and aberrations) counts as two tricks.</p><p>Come (DC 15): The animal comes to you, even if it normally would not do so.</p><p>Defend (DC 20): The animal defends you (or is ready to defend you if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, you can command the animal to defend a specific other character.</p><p>Down (DC 15): The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. An animal that doesn’t know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.</p><p>Fetch (DC 15): The animal goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the animal fetches some random object.</p><p>Guard (DC 20): The animal stays in place and prevents others from approaching.</p><p>Heel (DC 15): The animal follows you closely, even to places where it normally wouldn’t go.</p><p>Perform (DC 15): The animal performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.</p><p>Seek (DC 15): The animal moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate.</p><p>Stay (DC 15): The animal stays in place, waiting for you to return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by,</p><p>though it still defends itself if it needs to.</p><p>Track (DC 20): The animal tracks the scent presented to it. (This requires the animal to have the scent ability)</p><p>Work (DC 15): The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy load.</p><p><em>목적을 가지고 동물 가르치기:</em> Rather than teaching an animal individual tricks, you can simply train it for a general purpose. Essentially, an animal’s purpose represents a preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or heavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal prerequisites for all tricks included in the training package. If the package includes more than three tricks, the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2.</p><p>An animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though if the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and beyond those included in its general purpose), it may do so. Training an animal for a purpose requires fewer checks than teaching individual tricks does, but no less time. </p><p>Combat Riding (DC 20): An animal trained to bear a rider into combat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel. Training an animal for combat riding takes six weeks. You may also “upgrade” an animal trained for riding to one trained for combat riding by spending three weeks and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check. The new general purpose and tricks completely replace the animal’s previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Warhorses and riding dogs are already trained to bear riders into combat, and they don’t require any additional training for this purpose.</p><p>Fighting (DC 20): An animal trained to engage in combat knows the tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an animal for fighting takes three weeks.</p><p>Guarding (DC 20): An animal trained to guard knows the tricks attack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal for guarding takes four weeks.</p><p>Heavy Labor (DC 15): An animal trained for heavy labor knows the tricks come and work. Training an animal for heavy labor takes two weeks.</p><p>Hunting (DC 20): An animal trained for hunting knows the tricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and track. Training an animal for hunting takes six weeks.</p><p>Performance (DC 15): An animal trained for performance knows the tricks come, fetch, heel, perform, and stay. Training an animal for performance takes five weeks.</p><p>Riding (DC 15): An animal trained to bear a rider knows the tricks come, heel, and stay. Training an animal for riding takes three weeks.</p><p><em>야생 동물 키우기:</em> To rear an animal means to raise a wild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated.

Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, calculate your result as if you had rolled a 10. For many routine tasks, taking 10 makes them automatically successful. Distractions or threats (such as combat) make it impossible for a character to take 10. In most cases, taking 10 is purely a safety measure —you know (or expect) that an average roll will succeed but fear that a poor roll might fail, so you elect to settle for the average roll (a 10). Taking 10 is especially useful in situations where a particularly high roll wouldn’t help.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e20 받기:\u003c/strong\u003eWhen you have plenty of time (generally 2 minutes for a skill that can normally be checked in 1 round, one full-round action, or one standard action), you are faced with no threats or distractions, and the skill being attempted carries no penalties for failure, you can take 20. In other words, eventually you will get a 20 on 1d20 if you roll enough times. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, just calculate your result as if you had rolled a 20.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTaking 20 means you are trying until you get it right, and it assumes that you fail many times before succeeding.

Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result × the DC doesn’t equal the price, then it represents the progress you’ve made this week.

To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20.

Training an animal for a purpose requires fewer checks than teaching individual tricks does, but no less time. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCombat Riding (DC 20): An animal trained to bear a rider into combat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel. Training an animal for combat riding takes six weeks. You may also “upgrade” an animal trained for riding to one trained for combat riding by spending three weeks and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check. The new general purpose and tricks completely replace the animal’s previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Warhorses and riding dogs are already trained to bear riders into combat, and they don’t require any additional training for this purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFighting (DC 20): An animal trained to engage in combat knows the tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an animal for fighting takes three weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuarding (DC 20): An animal trained to guard knows the tricks attack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal for guarding takes four weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHeavy Labor (DC 15): An animal trained for heavy labor knows the tricks come and work. Training an animal for heavy labor takes two weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHunting (DC 20): An animal trained for hunting knows the tricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and track. Training an animal for hunting takes six weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerformance (DC 15): An animal trained for performance knows the tricks come, fetch, heel, perform, and stay. Training an animal for performance takes five weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRiding (DC 15): An animal trained to bear a rider knows the tricks come, heel, and stay.

A handler can rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA successfully domesticated animal can be taught tricks at the same time it’s being raised, or it can be taught as a domesticated animal later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e행동:\u003c/strong\u003e Varies. Handling an animal is a move action, while pushing an animal is a full-round action. (A druid or ranger can handle her animal companion as a free action or push it as a move action.) For tasks with specific time frames noted above, you must spend half this time (at the rate of 3 hours per day per animal being handled) working toward completion of the task before you attempt the Handle Animal check. If the check fails, your attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal fails and you need not complete the teaching, rearing, or training time. If the check succeeds, you must invest the remainder of the time to complete the teaching, rearing, or training. If the time is interrupted or the task is not followed through to completion, the attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal automatically fails.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e다시 시도하기:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes, except for rearing an animal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e특수:\u003c/strong\u003e You can use this skill on a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 that is not an animal, but the DC of any such check increases by 5.
