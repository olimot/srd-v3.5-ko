          <p>
            The four basic dungeon types are defined by their current 상태확인. Many 던전 are variations on these basic
            types or combinations of more than one of them. Sometimes old 던전 are used again and again by different
            inhabitants for different 목적.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700">Ruined Structure:</span
            ><span>
              Once occupied, this place is now abandoned (completely or in part) by its original creator or creators,
              and other creatures have wandered in. Many subterranean creatures look for abandoned underground 제작 in
              which to make their lairs. Any 함정 that might exist have probably been set off, but wandering beasts
              might very well be common.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700">Occupied Structure:</span
            ><span>
              This type of dungeon is still in use. Creatures (usually intelligent) live there, although they may not be
              the dungeon’s creators. An occupied structure might be a home, a fortress, a temple, an active mine, a
              prison, or a headquarters. This type of dungeon is less likely to have 함정 or wandering beasts, and more
              likely to have organized guards—both on watch and on patrol. 함정 or wandering beasts that might be
              encountered are usually under the control of the occupants. Occupied structures have furnishings to suit
              the inhabitants, as well as decorations, supplies, and the ability for occupants to 이동 around (문 they
              can open, hallways large enough for them to pass through, and so on). The inhabitants might have a
              communication system, and they almost certainly control an access to the outside.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Some 던전 are partially occupied and partially empty or in 파멸. In such cases, the occupants are typically
            not the original builders but instead a group of intelligent creatures that have set up their base, lair, or
            fortification within an abandoned dungeon.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700">Safe Storage: </span
            ><span
              >When people want to protect something, they might bury it underground. Whether the item they want to
              protect is a fabulous 전리품, a forbidden artifact, or 죽음 body of an important figure, these
              valuable objects are placed within a dungeon and surrounded by barriers, 함정, and guardians.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The safe storage type of dungeon is the most likely to have 함정 but the least likely to have wandering
            beasts. This type of dungeon normally is built for function rather than appearance, but sometimes it has
            ornamentation in the form of statuary or painted 벽. This is particularly true of the tombs of important
            people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes, however, a vault or a crypt is constructed in such a way as to house living guardians. The
            problem with this strategy is that something must be done to keep the creatures alive between intrusion
            attempts. Magic is usually the best solution to provide food and water for these creatures. Even if there’s
            no way anything living can survive in a safe storage dungeon, certain 몬스터 can still serve as guardians.
            Builders of vaults or tombs often place undead creatures or constructs, both of which which have no need for
            생활 유지 or rest, to guard their 던전. 마법 함정 can 공격 intruders by summoning 몬스터 into the dungeon.
            These guardians also need no 생활 유지, since they appear only when they’re needed and disappear when their
            task is done.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700">Natural Cavern Complex:</span
            ><span>
              Underground caves provide homes for all sorts of subterranean 몬스터. Created naturally and connected by a
              labyrinthine tunnel system, these caverns lack any sort of pattern, order, or decoration. With no
              intelligent force behind its 제작, this type of dungeon is the least likely to have 함정 or even 문.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Fungi of all sorts thrive in caves, sometimes growing in huge forests of mushrooms and puffballs.
            Subterranean predators prowl these forests, looking for those feeding upon the fungi. Some varieties of 버섯
            give off a phosphorescent glow, providing a natural cavern complex with its own limited 빛 source. In other
            범위, a <span style="font-style: italic">햇살 </span>spell or similar magical effect can provide enough 빛
            for green plants to grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often, a natural cavern complex connects with another type of 던전, the caves having been discovered when
            the manufactured dungeon was delved. A cavern complex can connect two otherwise unrelated 던전, sometimes
            creating a strange mixed 환경. A natural cavern complex joined with another dungeon often provides a route
            by which subterranean creatures find their way into a manufactured dungeon and populate it.

            Sometimes, masonry 벽—stones piled on top of each other (usually but not always held in place with
            mortar)—divide 던전 into 통로 and chambers. Dungeon 벽 can also be hewn from solid rock, leaving them with a
            rough, chiseled look. Or, dungeon 벽 can be the smooth, unblemished stone of a naturally occurring cave.
            Dungeon 벽 are difficult to break down or through, but they’re generally easy to 등반.

              The most common kind of dungeon wall, masonry 벽 are usually at least 1 foot thick. Often these ancient 벽
              sport cracks and crevices, and sometimes dangerous slimes or small 몬스터 live in these 범위 and wait for
              prey. Masonry 벽 stop all but the loudest noises. It takes a DC 20 등반 check to travel along a masonry
              wall.</span

            ><span>
              Sometimes masonry 벽 are better built (smoother, with tighter-fitting stones and less cracking), and
              occasionally these superior 벽 are covered with plaster or stucco. Covered 벽 often bear paintings, carved
              reliefs, or other decoration. Superior masonry 벽 are no more difficult to destroy than regular masonry 벽
              but are more difficult to 등반(DC 25).</span

            ><span>
              Such 벽 usually result when a chamber or passage is tunneled out from solid rock. The rough surface of a
              hewn wall frequently provides minuscule ledges where 버섯 grows and fissures where vermin, 박쥐, and
              subterranean 뱀 live. When such a wall has an “other side” (it separates two chambers in the dungeon), the
              wall is usually at least 3 feet thick; anything thinner risks collapsing from the weight of all the stone
              overhead. It takes a DC 25 등반 check to 등반 a hewn stone wall.</span

              These surfaces are uneven and rarely flat. They are smooth to the touch but filled with tiny holes, hidden
              alcoves, and ledges at various heights. They’re also usually wet or at least damp, since it’s water that
              most frequently creates natural caves. When such a wall has an “other side,” the wall is usually at least
              5 feet thick. It takes a DC 15 등반 check to 이동 along an unworked stone wall.

              Some 바닥 are designed to become suddenly dangerous. With the application of just the right amount of

              designed to make 전투 more exciting and deadly. Construct these 바닥 as you would any other trap.

              >Constructed of thick planks nailed together, sometimes bound with iron for 근력(and to reduce swelling
              from dungeon dampness), wooden 문 are the most common type. Wooden 문 come in varying 근력: simple, good,
              and strong 문. Simple 문(break DC 13) are not meant to keep out motivated attackers. Good 문(break DC
              16), while sturdy and long-lasting, are still not meant to take much punishment. Strong 문(break DC 23)
              are bound in iron and are a sturdy barrier to those attempting to get past them. Iron hinges fasten the
              door to its frame, and typically a circular pull-ring in the center is there to help open it. Sometimes,
              instead of a pull-ring, a door has an iron pull-bar on one or both sides of the door to serve as a handle.
              In inhabited 던전, these 문 are usually well maintained (not stuck) and unlocked, although important 범위

            Attempts to literally chop a door down with a slashing or bludgeoning weapon use the hardness and 히트

            but by breaking its lock, bar, or hinges. When assigning a DC to an attempt to 똑똑똑 a door down, use the

            <span style="font-weight: 700">Locks:</span
            ><span>
              Dungeon 문 are often locked, and thus 자물쇠 열기 skill comes in very handy. Locks are usually built
              into the door, either on the edge opposite the hinges or right in the middle of the door. Builtin locks
              either control an iron bar that juts out of the door and into the wall of its frame, or else a sliding
              iron bar or heavy wooden bar that rests behind the entire door. By contrast, padlocks are not built-in but
              usually 달리기 through two 반지, one on the door and the other on the wall. More complex locks, such as
              combination locks and puzzle locks, are usually built into the door itself. Because such keyless locks are
              larger and more complex, they are typically only found in sturdy 문(strong wooden, stone, or iron
              문).</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            자물쇠 열기 DC to pick a lock often falls into 거리 of 20 to 30, although locks with lower or higher
            DCs can exist. A door can have more than one lock, each of which must be unlocked separately. Locks are
            often trapped, usually with 독 needles that extend out to prick a 도적’s finger.
          </p>
          <p>
            Breaking a lock is sometimes quicker than breaking the whole door. If a PC wants to whack at a lock with a
            weapon, treat the typical lock as having hardness 15 and 30 히트 포인트. A lock can only be broken if it can
            be attacked separately from the door, which means that a built-in lock is immune to this sort of treatment.
            In an occupied dungeon, every locked door should have a key somewhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            A special door (see below for examples) might have a lock with no key, instead requiring that the right
            combination of nearby levers must be manipulated or the right symbols must be pressed on a keypad in the
            correct sequence to open the door.

              successful 장치 무력화 checks (assuming the hinges are on their side of the door, of course). Such a task
              has a DC of 20 because most hinges are rusted or stuck. Breaking a hinge is difficult. Most have hardness

              These hinges are built into the wall and allow the door to swing open in either direction. PCs can’t get
              at the hinges to fool with them unless they break through the doorframe or wall. Nested hinges are
              typically found on stone 문 but sometimes on wooden or iron 문 as well.

              >Pivots aren’t really hinges at all, but simple knobs jutting from the top and bottom of the door that fit
              into holes in the doorframe, allowing the door to spin. The advantages of pivots is that they can’t be
              dismantled like hinges and they’re simple to make. The disadvantage is that since the door pivots on its
              center of gravity (typically in the middle), nothing larger than half the door’s width can fit through. 문
              with pivots are usually stone and are often quite wide to overcome this disadvantage. Another solution is
              to place the pivot toward one side and have the door be thicker at that end and thinner toward the other
              end so that it opens more like a normal door. Secret 문 in 벽 often turn on pivots, since the lack of
              hinges makes it easier to 숨기 the door’s presence. Pivots also allow objects such as bookcases to be used

            Builders might put a secret door down low near the floor or high up in a wall, making it difficult to find

              venerate something of great historical or personal value. Depending on the creature’s resources and piety,
              a shrine can be humble or extensive. A shrine is where PCs will likely encounter NPC 사제, and it’s common

            Cave-ins and collapsing tunnels are extremely dangerous. Not only do dungeon explorers face the danger of
            being crushed by tons of 낙하 rock, even if they survive they may be buried beneath a pile of rubble or cut
            off from the only known exit. A cave-in buries anyone in the middle of the collapsing 범위, and then sliding
            debris 피해 anyone in the periphery of the collapse. A typical corridor subject to a cave-in might have a
            bury zone with a 15-foot radius and a 10-foot-radius slide zone extending beyond the bury zone. A weakened
            ceiling can be spotted with a DC 20 지식(architecture and engineering) or DC 20 제작(stonemasonry) check.
            Remember that 제작 checks can be made untrained as 지능 checks. 드워프 can make such a check if he simply
            passes within 10 feet of a weakened ceiling.
          </p>
          <p>
            A weakened ceiling may collapse when subjected to a major impact or concussion. A character can cause a

          </p>
          <p>
            Characters in the bury zone of a cave-in take 8d6 points of 피해, or half that amount if they make a DC 15
            Reflex save. They are subsequently buried. Characters in the slide zone take 3d6 points of 피해, or no 피해
            at all if they make a DC 15 Reflex save. Characters in the slide zone who fail their 내성 굴림 are buried.
          </p>
          <p>
            Characters take 1d6 points of 비치명적인 피해 per minute while buried. If such a character falls
            unconscious, he must make a DC 15 건강 check. If it fails, he takes 1d6 points of lethal 피해 each minute
            thereafter until freed or 죽음.
          </p>
          <p>
            Characters who aren’t buried can dig out their friends. In 1 minute, using only her hands, a character can
            clear rocks and debris equal to five times her heavy load limit. The amount of loose stone that fills a
            5-foot-by-5-foot 범위 weighs one ton (2,000 pounds). Armed with an appropriate tool, such as a pick,
            crowbar, or shovel, a digger can clear loose stone twice as quickly as by hand. You may allow a buried
            character to free himself with a DC 25 근력 check.

            first round of contact, the slime can be scraped off a creature (most likely destroying the scraping
            device), but after that it must be frozen, burned, or cut away (dealing 피해 to the victim as well).
            Anything that deals cold or fire 피해, sunlight, or a

            There are many ways to get lost in 야생. Following an obvious road, trail, or feature such as a stream
            or shoreline prevents any possibility of becoming lost, but travelers striking off cross-country may become
            disoriented—especially in 상태이상 of poor visibility or in difficult terrain.

              Any time characters cannot see at least 60 feet in the prevailing 상태이상 of visibility, they may become
              lost. Characters traveling through 안개, snow, or a downpour might easily lose the ability to see any
              landmarks not in their immediate vicinity. Similarly, characters traveling at night may be at risk, too,
              depending on the quality of their 빛 sources, the amount of moonlight, and whether they have 암흑시야 or
              lowlight 시야.</span

                are often clustered together. Undergrowth and trees aren’t mutually exclusive; it’s common for a 5-foot
                square to have both a tree and undergrowth.</span

                It’s common for 엘프 and other forest dwellers to live on raised platforms far above the surface floor.
                These wooden platforms generally have rope bridges between them. To get to the treehouses, characters
                generally ascend the trees’ branches (등반 DC 15), 밧줄 사용 ladders (등반 DC 0), or take pulley
                elevators (which can be made to rise a number of feet equal to a 근력 check, made each round as a
                full-round action). Creatures on platforms or branches in a forest canopy are considered to have 엄폐

            <div class="original-headline">Forest Fires (CR 6)</div>
            <p>
              Most campfire sparks ignite nothing, but if 상태이상 are dry, 바람 are strong, or the forest floor is
              dried out and flammable, a forest fire can result. Lightning strikes often set trees afire and start 숲
              화재 in this way. Whatever the cause of the fire, travelers can get caught in the conflagration.
            </p>
            <p>
              A forest fire can be spotted from as far away as 2d6×100 feet by a character who makes a 감지 check,
              treating the fire as a Colossal creature (reducing the DC by 16). If all characters fail their 감지
              checks, the fire 이동 closer to them. They automatically see it when it closes to half the original
              distance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Characters who are blinded or otherwise unable to make 감지 checks can feel the heat of the fire (and thus
              automatically “감지” it) when it is 100 feet away.
            </p>
            <p>
              The leading edge of a fire (the downwind side) can advance faster than a human can 달리기(assume 120 feet
              per round for 바람 of moderate 근력). Once a particular portion of the forest is ablaze, it remains so for
              2d4×10 minutes before 죽어가고 있음 to a smoking smolder. Characters overtaken by a forest fire may find
              the leading edge of the fire advancing away from them faster than they can keep up, trapping them deeper
              and deeper in its grasp.
            </p>
            <p>
              Within the bounds of a forest fire, a character faces three dangers: heat 피해, 불 붙음, and smoke
              inhalation.

              ><span>
                Getting caught within a forest fire is even worse than being exposed to extreme heat (see 고온 피해).
                Breathing the air causes a character to take 1d6 points of 피해 per round (no save). In addition, a
                character must make a Fortitude save every 5 rounds (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of
                비치명적인 피해. A character who holds his breath can avoid the lethal 피해, but not 비치명적인

            The three 산악 지형 categories are alpine meadows, rugged mountains, and forbidding mountains. As characters
            ascend into a mountainous 범위, they’re likely to face each terrain category in turn, beginning with alpine
            meadows, extending through rugged mountains, and reaching forbidding mountains near the summit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mountains have an important terrain element, the rock wall, that is marked on the border between squares
            rather than taking up squares itself.

                Most alpine meadows begin above the tree line, so trees and other forest elements are rare in the

                streambeds (treat as a trench 5 to 10 feet across). Particularly high-altitude 범위 tend to be colder

                As a guideline, the maximum distance in 산악 지형 at which a 감지 check for detecting the nearby

            <div class="original-headline">Avalanches (CR 7)</div>
            <p>
              The combination of high peaks and heavy snowfalls means that 만년설 산악 지형 are a deadly peril in many
              mountainous 범위. While 만년설 산악 지형 of snow and ice are common, it’s also possible to have an
              avalanche of rock and soil.
            </p>
            <p>
              An avalanche can be spotted from as far away as 1d10×500 feet downslope by a character who makes a DC 20
              감지 check, treating the avalanche as a Colossal creature. If all characters fail their 감지 checks to
              determine the encounter distance, the avalanche 이동 closer to them, and they automatically become aware
              of it when it closes to half the original distance. It’s possible to hear an avalanche coming even if you
              can’t see it. Under optimum 상태이상(no other loud noises occurring), a character who makes a DC 15 듣기
              check can hear the avalanche or landslide when it is 1d6×500 feet away. This check might have a DC of 20,
              25, or higher in 상태이상 where hearing is difficult (such as in the middle of a thunderstorm).
            </p>
            <p>
              A landslide or avalanche consists of two distinct 범위: the bury zone (in the direct path of 낙하
              debris) and the slide zone (범위 the debris spreads out to encompass). Characters in the bury zone
              always take 피해 from the avalanche; characters in the slide zone may be able to get out of the way.
              Characters in the bury zone take 8d6 points of 피해, or half that amount if they make a DC 15 Reflex save.
              They are subsequently buried (see below). Characters in the slide zone take 3d6 points of 피해, or no 피해
              if they make a DC 15 Reflex save. Those who fail their 내성 굴림 are buried.
            </p>
            <p>
              Buried characters take 1d6 points of 비치명적인 피해 per minute. If a buried character falls unconscious,
              he or she must make a DC 15 건강 check or take 1d6 points of lethal 피해 each minute thereafter until
              freed or 죽음.
            </p>
            <p>
              The typical avalanche has a width of 1d6×100 feet, from one edge of the slide zone to the opposite edge.
              The bury zone in the center of the avalanche is half as wide as the avalanche’s full width.
            </p>
            <p>
              To determine the precise location of characters in the path of an avalanche, roll 1d6×20; the result is
              the number of feet from the center of the path taken by the bury zone to the center of the party’s
              location. 만년설 산악 지형 of snow and ice advance at a 속도 of 500 feet per round, and rock 만년설 산악
              지형 travel at a 속도 of 250 feet per round.

          <p>
            사막 지형 exists in warm, temperate, and cold climates, but all deserts share one common trait: little rain.
            The three categories of 사막 지형 are tundra (cold deserts), rocky desert (often temperate), and sandy
            desert (often warm).
          </p>
          <p>
            Tundra differs from the other desert categories in two important ways. Because snow and ice 엄폐 much of the
            landscape, it’s easy to find water. And during the height of summer, the permafrost thaws to a depth of a
            foot or so, turning the landscape into a vast field of mud. The muddy tundra affects 이동 and skill use as
            the shallow bogs described in 늪지대, although there’s little standing water.
          </p>
          <p>
            The table above describes terrain elements found in each of the three desert categories. The terrain
            elements on this table are mutually exclusive; for instance, a square of tundra may contain either 빛
            undergrowth or an ice sheet, but not both.

                Tundra is sometimes bordered by forests, and the occasional tree isn’t out of place in the cold wastes.
                Rocky deserts have towers and mesas consisting of flat ground surrounded on all sides by cliffs and
                steep slopes (described in 산악 지형, above). Sandy deserts sometimes have quicksand; this functions as
                described in 늪지대, above, although desert quicksand is a waterless mixture of fine sand and dust. All
                사막 지형 is crisscrossed with dry streambeds (treat as trenches 5 to 15 feet wide) that fill with water

            Plains come in three categories: farms, grasslands, and battlefields. Farms are common in settled 범위, of
            course, while grasslands represent untamed plains. The battlefields where large armies clash are temporary
            places, usually reclaimed by natural vegetation or the farmer’s plow. Battlefields represent a third terrain
            category because adventurers tend to spend a lot of time there, not because they’re particularly prevalent.
          </p>
          <p>
            The table below shows the proportions of terrain elements in the different categories of plains. On a farm,
            빛 undergrowth represents most mature grain crops, so farms growing vegetable crops will have less 빛
            undergrowth, as will all farms during the time between harvest and a few months after planting.

                opponents who have <span style="font-style: italic">이동의 자유 </span>effects ignore this 엄폐 when
                making melee 공격 against targets in the water. A completely submerged creature has total 엄폐 against
                opponents on land unless those opponents have
                <span style="font-style: italic">이동의 자유 </span>effects. Magical effects are unaffected except for
                those that require 명중 굴림(which are treated like any other effects) and fire effects.</span

                Nonmagical fire (including alchemist’s fire) does not burn underwater. 주문 or spell-like effects with

                레벨). If the check succeeds, the spell creates a bubble of steam instead of its usual fiery effect, but
                otherwise the spell works as described. A supernatural fire effect is ineffective underwater unless its

              In spring, an enormous snowmelt can engorge the streams and rivers it feeds. Other catastrophic events

              During a flood, rivers become wider, deeper, and swifter. Assume that a river rises by 1d10+10 feet during
              the spring flood, and its width increases by a factor of 1d4×50%. Fords may disappear for days, bridges
              may be swept away, and even ferries might not be able to manage the crossing of a flooded river. A river
              in flood makes 수영 checks one category harder (calm water becomes rough, and rough water becomes stormy).

          <div class="original-headline">URBAN ADVENTURES</div>
          <p>
            At first glance, a city is much like a dungeon, made up of 벽, 문, 방, and 통로. Adventures that take place
            in cities have two salient differences from their dungeon counterparts, however. Characters have 상급 access
            to resources, and they must contend with law enforcement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700">Access to Resources:</span
            ><span>
              Unlike in 던전 and 야생, characters can buy and sell gear quickly in a city. A large city or
              metropolis probably has high-레벨 NPCs and 전문가 in obscure fields of 지식 who can provide assistance and
              decipher clues. And when the PCs are battered and bruised, they can retreat to the comfort of a room at
              the inn.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            자유 to retreat and 준비 access to the marketplace means that the players have a 상급 degree of control
            over the pacing of an urban adventure.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700">&nbsp;Law Enforcement:</span
            ><span>
              The other key distinctions between adventuring in a city and delving into a dungeon is that a dungeon is,
              almost by definition, a lawless place where the only law is that of the jungle: Kill or be killed. A city,
              on the other hand, is held together by a code of laws, many of which are explicitly designed to prevent
              the sort of behavior that adventurers engage in all the time: killing and looting. Even so, most cities’
              laws recognize 몬스터 as a threat to the stability the city relies on, and prohibitions about murder
              rarely apply to 몬스터 such as aberrations or evil outsiders. Most evil humanoids, however, are typically
              protected by the same laws that protect all the citizens of the city. Having an evil 성향 is not a crime
              (except in some severely theocratic cities, perhaps, with the magical power to back up the law); only evil
              deeds are against the law. Even when adventurers encounter an evildoer in the act of perpetrating some
              heinous evil upon the populace of the city, the law tends to frown on the sort of vigilante justice that
              leaves the evildoer 죽음 or otherwise unable to testify at a trial.</span

              Different cities have different laws about such issues as carrying 무기 in public and restricting

            </p>
            <p>
              The city’s laws may not affect all characters equally. A 수도사 isn’t hampered at all by a law about
              peace-bonding 무기, but a 사제 is reduced to a fraction of his power if all holy symbols are confiscated
              at the city’s 관문.

            <p>
              Many cities are surrounded by 벽. A typical small city wall is a fortified stone wall 5 feet thick and 20
              feet high. Such a wall is fairly smooth, requiring a DC 30 등반 check to scale. 벽 are crenellated on
              one side to provide a low wall for the guards atop it, and there is just barely room for guards to walk
              along the top of the wall. A typical small city wall has AC 3, hardness 8, and 450 hp per 10-foot section.
            </p>
            <p>
              A typical large city wall is 10 feet thick and 30 feet high, with crenellations on both sides for the
              guards on top of the wall. It is likewise smooth, requiring a DC 30 등반 check to scale. Such a wall has
              AC 3, hardness 8, and 720 hp per 10-foot section.
            </p>

              A typical metropolis wall is 15 feet thick and 40 feet tall. It has crenellations on both sides and often
              has a tunnel and small 방 running through its interior. Metropolis 벽 have AC 3, hardness 8, and 1,170 hp
              per 10- foot section.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike smaller cities, metropolises often have interior 벽 as well as surrounding 벽—either old 벽 that
              the city has outgrown, or 벽 dividing individual districts from each other. Sometimes these 벽 are as
              large and thick as the outer 벽, but more often they have the characteristics of a large city’s or small
              city’s 벽.

              ><span>
                Some city 벽 are adorned with watch towers set at irregular intervals. Few cities have enough guards to
                keep someone constantly stationed at every tower, unless the city is expecting 공격 from outside. The
                towers provide a superior view of the surrounding countryside as well as a point of defense against
                invaders.</span

            </p>
            <p>
              Watch towers are typically 10 feet higher than the wall they adjoin, and their diameter is 5 times the
              thickness of the wall. Arrow slits line the outer sides of the upper stories of a tower, and the top is
              crenellated like the surrounding 벽 are. In a small tower (25 feet in diameter adjoining a 5-foot-thick
              wall), a simple ladder typically connect the tower’s stories and the roof. In a larger tower, stairs serve
              that 목적.

              Heavy wooden 문, reinforced with iron and bearing good locks (자물쇠 열기 DC 30), block entry to a tower,
              unless the tower is in regular use. As a rule, the captain of the guard keeps the key to the tower secured
              on her person, and a second copy is in the city’s inner fortress or barracks.

              ><span>
                A typical city 관문 is a gatehouse with two portcullises and murder holes above the space between them.
                In towns and some small cities, the primary entry is through iron double 문 set into the city
                wall.</span

            </p>
            <p>
              관문 are usually open during the day and locked or barred at night. Usually, one 관문 lets in travelers
              after sunset and is staffed by guards who will open it for someone who seems honest, presents proper
              papers, or offers a large enough bribe (depending on the city and the guards).

              A city typically has full-time military personnel equal to 1% of its adult population, in addition to
              militia or conscript soldiers equal to 5% of the population. The full-time soldiers are city guards
              responsible for maintaining order within the city, similar to the role of modern police, and (to a 하급
              extent) for defending the city from outside assault. Conscript soldiers are called up to serve in case of
              an 공격 on the city.

                Table 3–26. If the check succeeds, the catapult stone hits the square the catapult was aimed at, dealing
                the indicated 피해 to any object or character in the square. Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Reflex
                save take half 피해. Once a catapult stone hits a square, subsequent shots hit the same square unless

              If a catapult stone misses, roll 1d8 to determine where it lands. This determines 눈속임 of the throw,
              with 1 being back toward the catapult and 2 through 8 counting clockwise around the target square. Then,
              count 3 squares away from the target square for every 거리 increment of 공격.

              Loading a catapult requires a series of 전체 라운드 행동. It takes a DC 15 근력 check to winch the
              throwing arm down; most catapults have wheels to allow up to two crew members to use 보조하기 action,
              assisting the main winch operator. A DC 15 전문직(siege engineer) check latches the arm into place, and
              then another DC 15 전문직(siege engineer) check loads the catapult ammunition. It takes four 전체 라운드
              행동 to reaim a heavy catapult (multiple crew members can 공연 these 전체 라운드 행동 in the same round,
              so it would take a crew of four only 1 round to reaim the catapult).

              Some cities have no larger thoroughfares, particularly cities that gradually grew from small settlements
              to larger cities. Cities that are planned, or perhaps have suffered a major fire that allowed authorities
              to construct new roads through formerly inhabited 범위, might have a few larger streets through town.
              These main roads are 25 feet wide—offering room for wagons to pass each other—with 5-foot-wide sidewalks

            <p>
              Most 도시의 건물 fall into three categories. The majority of buildings in the city are two to five stories
              high, built side by side to form long rows separated by secondary or main streets. These row houses
              usually have businesses on the ground floor, with offices or apartments above.

            <p>
              Inns, successful businesses, and large warehouses—as well as millers, tanners, and other businesses that
              require extra space— are generally large, free-standing buildings with up to five stories.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, small residences, shops, warehouses, or storage sheds are simple, one-story wooden buildings,
              especially if they’re in poorer neighborhoods.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most 도시의 건물 are made of a combination of stone or clay brick (on the lower one or two stories) and
              timbers (for the upper stories, interior 벽, and 바닥). Roofs are a mixture of boards, thatch, and slates,
              sealed with pitch. A typical lower-story wall is 1 foot thick, with AC 3, hardness 8, 90 hp, and a 등반 DC
              of 25. Upper-story 벽 are 6 inches thick, with AC 3, hardness 5, 60 hp, and a 등반 DC of 21. Exterior 문
              on most buildings are good wooden 문 that are usually kept locked, except on public buildings such as
              shops and taverns.

                Instead of being blown away (see 표: Wind Effects), characters in close proximity to a tornado who
                fail their Fortitude 내성 굴림 are sucked toward the tornado. Those who come in contact with the actual
                funnel cloud are picked up and whirled around for 1d10 rounds, taking 6d6 points of 피해 per round,
                before being violently expelled (낙하 피해 may apply). While a tornado’s rotational 속도 can be as great
                as 300 mph, the funnel itself 이동 forward at an average of 30 mph (roughly 250 feet per round). A

            Cold and exposure deal 비치명적인 피해 to the victim. This 비치명적인 피해 cannot be recovered until the
            character gets out of the cold and warms up again. Once a character is rendered unconscious through the
            accumulation of 비치명적인 피해, the cold and exposure begins to deal lethal 피해 at the same rate.

            An unprotected character in cold 날씨(below 40° F) must make a Fortitude save each hour (DC 15, + 1 per
            previous check) or take 1d6 points of 비치명적인 피해. A character who has 생존 skill may receive a

            In 상태이상 of severe cold or exposure (below 0° F), an unprotected character must make a Fortitude save
            once every 10 minutes (DC 15, +1 per previous check), taking 1d6 points of 비치명적인 피해 on each failed

            보너스 to other characters as well (see the skill 묘사). Characters wearing winter 의류 only need check once

            A character who takes any 비치명적인 피해 from cold or exposure is beset by frostbite or hypothermia (treat

          <div class="original-headline">DARKNESS</div>
          <p>
            암흑시야 allows many characters and 몬스터 to see perfectly well without any 빛 at all, but characters with
            normal 시야(or 저광시야, for that matter) can be rendered completely blind by putting out 빛. Torches
            or lanterns can be blown out by sudden gusts of subterranean wind, magical 빛 sources can be dispelled or
            countered, or magical 함정 might create fields of impenetrable 암흑.
          </p>
          <p>
            In many cases, some characters or 몬스터 might be able to see, while others are blinded. For 목적 of the
            following points, a blinded creature is one who simply can’t see through the surrounding 암흑.
          </p>
          <p>
            —Creatures blinded by 암흑 lose the ability to deal extra 피해 due to precision (for example, a sneak 공격).
          </p>
          <p>
            —Blinded creatures are hampered in their 이동, and pay 2 squares of 이동 per square moved into (double
            normal cost). Blinded creatures can’t 달리기 or 돌격.
          </p>
          <p>
            —All opponents have total 은폐 from a blinded creature, so the blinded creature has a 50% miss chance in
            전투. A blinded creature must first pinpoint the location of an opponent in order to 공격 the right square;
            if the blinded creature launches an 공격 without pinpointing its foe, it 공격 a random square within its
            reach. For ranged 공격 or 주문 against a foe whose location is not pinpointed, roll to determine which
            adjacent square the blinded creature is facing; its 공격 is directed at the closest target that lies in that
            direction.
          </p>
          <p>—A blinded creature loses its 민첩 adjustment to AC and takes a –2 페널티 to AC.</p>
          <p>
            —A blinded creature takes a –4 페널티 on 탐색 checks and most 근력- and 민첩-based 스킬 판정, including any
            with an 갑옷 check 페널티. A creature blinded by 암흑 automatically fails any skill check relying on 시야.
          </p>
          <p>—Creatures blinded by 암흑 cannot use 시선 공격 and are immune to 시선 공격.</p>
          <p>
            A creature blinded by 암흑 can make a 듣기 check as a free action each round in order to locate foes (DC
            equal to opponents’ 조용히 이동 checks). A successful check lets a blinded character hear an unseen creature
            “over there somewhere.” It’s almost impossible to pinpoint the location of an unseen creature. A 듣기 check
            that beats the DC by 20 reveals the unseen creature’s square (but the unseen creature still has total 은폐
            from the blinded creature).
          </p>
          <p>
            —A blinded creature can grope about to find unseen creatures. A character can make a touch 공격 with his
            hands or a weapon into two adjacent squares using a standard action. If an unseen target is in the
            designated square, there is a 50% miss chance on the touch 공격. If successful, the groping character deals
            no 피해 but has pinpointed the unseen creature’s current location. (If the unseen creature 이동, its
            location is once again unknown.)
          </p>
          <p>
            —If a blinded creature is struck by an unseen foe, the blinded character pinpoints the location of the
            creature that struck him (until the unseen creature 이동, of course). The only exception is if the unseen
            creature has a reach 상급 than 5 feet (in which case the blinded character knows the location of the unseen
            opponent, but has not pinpointed him) or uses a ranged 공격(in which case, the blinded character knows the
            general direction of the foe, but not his location).
          </p>
          <p>
            —A creature with 냄새 ability automatically pinpoints unseen creatures within 5 feet of its location.

            <span style="font-weight: 700">낙하 피해:</span

          </p>
          <p>
            If a character deliberately 도약 instead of merely slipping or 낙하, 피해 is the same but the first 1d6
            is 비치명적인 피해. A DC 15 도약 check or DC 15 재주넘기 check allows the character to avoid any 피해 from
            the first 10 feet fallen and converts any 피해 from the second 10 feet to 비치명적인 피해. Thus, a character
            who slips from a ledge 30 feet up takes 3d6 피해. If the same character deliberately jumped, he takes 1d6
            points of 비치명적인 피해 and 2d6 points of lethal 피해. And if the character leaps down with a successful
            도약 or 재주넘기 check, he takes only 1d6 points of 비치명적인 피해 and 1d6 points of lethal 피해 from the
            plunge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Falls onto yielding surfaces (soft ground, mud) also convert the first 1d6 of 피해 to 비치명적인 피해. This
            reduction is cumulative with reduced 피해 due to deliberate 도약 and 도약 skill.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700">낙하 into Water:</span
            ><span>
              Falls into water are handled somewhat differently. If the water is at least 10 feet deep, the first 20
              feet of 낙하 do no 피해. The next 20 feet do 비치명적인 피해(1d3 per 10-foot increment). Beyond that,
              낙하 피해 is lethal 피해(1d6 per additional 10-foot increment).</span
            >

          <p>
            Characters who deliberately dive into water take no 피해 on a successful DC 15 수영 check or DC 15 재주넘기
            check, so long as the water is at least 10 feet deep for every 30 feet fallen. However, the DC of the check
            increases by 5 for every 50 feet of the dive.

            Just as characters take 피해 when they fall more than 10 feet, so too do they take 피해 when they are hit by
            물체 낙하.
          </p>
          <p>Objects that fall upon characters deal 피해 based on their weight and the distance they have fallen.</p>
          <p>
            For each 200 pounds of an object’s weight, the object deals 1d6 points of 피해, provided it falls at least
            10 feet. Distance also comes into play, adding an additional 1d6 points of 피해 for every 10-foot increment
            it falls beyond the first (to a maximum of 20d6 points of 피해).
          </p>

            In severe heat (above 110° F), a character must make a Fortitude save once every 10 minutes (DC 15, +1 for
            each previous check) or take 1d4 points of 비치명적인 피해. Characters wearing heavy 의류 or 갑옷 of any
            sort take a –4 페널티 on their 내성 굴림. A character with 생존 skill may receive 보너스 on this 내성
            굴림 and may be able to apply this 보너스 to other characters as well. Characters reduced to unconsciousness
            begin taking lethal 피해(1d4 points per each 10-minute period).
          </p>
          <p>
            A character who takes any 비치명적인 피해 from heat exposure now suffers from heatstroke and is fatigued.
          </p>
          <p>These 페널티 end when the character recovers 비치명적인 피해 she took from the heat.</p>
          <p>
            Extreme heat (air temperature over 140° F, fire, boiling water, lava) deals lethal 피해. Breathing air in
            these temperatures deals 1d6 points of 피해 per minute (no save). In addition, a character must make a
            Fortitude save every 5 minutes (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of 비치명적인 피해. Those
            wearing heavy 의류 or any sort of 갑옷 take a –4 페널티 on their 내성 굴림. In addition, those wearing
            metal 갑옷 or coming into contact with very hot metal are affected as if by a
            <span style="font-style: italic">금속 가열 </span>spell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Boiling water deals 1d6 points of scalding 피해, unless the character is fully immersed, in which case it
            deals 10d6 points of 피해 per round of exposure.

            <p>
              Characters exposed to burning oil, bonfires, and noninstantaneous magic firesmight find their clothes,
              hair, or 장비 on fire. 주문 with an instantaneous durationdon’t normally set a character on fire, since
              the heat and flame from these come and go in a flash.
            </p>
            <p>
              Characters at risk of catching fire are allowed a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid this fate. If a character’s
              clothes or hair catch fire, he takes 1d6 points of 피해 immediately. In each subsequent round, the burning
              character must make another Reflex 내성 굴림. Failure means he takes another 1d6 points of 피해 that
              round. Success means that the fire has gone out. (That is, once he succeeds on his 내성 굴림, he’s no
              longer on fire.)
            </p>
            <p>
              A character on fire may automatically extinguish the flames by jumping into enough water to douse himself.
              If no body of water is at hand, rolling on the ground or smothering the fire with cloaks or the like
              permits the character another save with a +4 보너스.
            </p>
            <p>
              Those unlucky enough to have their clothes or 장비 catch fire must make DC 15 Reflex 내성 굴림 for each
              item. Flammable items that fail take the same amount of 피해 as the character.
            </p>

            <div class="original-headline">Lava Effects</div>
            <p>
              Lava or magma deals 2d6 points of 피해 per round of exposure, except in the case of total immersion (such
              as when a character falls into the crater of an active volcano), which deals 20d6 points of 피해 per
              round.
            </p>
            <p>
              피해 from magma continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional 피해 is only half of
              that dealt during actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 10d6 points per round).
            </p>
            <p>
              An immunity or 저항 to fire serves as an immunity to lava or magma. However, a creature immune to fire
              might still drown if completely immersed in lava (see 숨참기, below).

            A character who breathes heavy smoke must make a Fortitude save each round (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or
            spend that round choking and coughing. A character who chokes for 2 consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of

          <p>
            Characters might find themselves without food or water and with no means to obtain them. In normal climates,
            Medium characters need at least a gallon of fluids and about a pound of decent food per day to avoid
            starvation. (소형 캐릭터 need half as much.) In very hot climates, characters need two or three times as
            much water to avoid dehydration.
          </p>
          <p>
            A character can go without water for 1 day plus a number of hours equal to his 건강 score. After this time,
            the character must make a 건강 check each hour (DC 10, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d6 points of
            비치명적인 피해.
          </p>
          <p>
            A character can go without food for 3 days, in growing discomfort. After this time, the character must make
            a 건강 check each day (DC 10, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d6 points of 비치명적인 피해.
          </p>
          <p>
            Characters who have taken 비치명적인 피해 from lack of food or water are fatigued. 비치명적인 피해 from
            thirst or starvation cannot be recovered until the character gets food or water, as needed—not even magic
            that restores 히트 포인트 치료 this 피해.

            A character who has no air to breathe can hold her breath for 2 rounds per point of 건강. After this period
            of time, the character must make a DC 10 건강 check in order to continue holding her breath. The save must
            be repeated each round, with the DC increasing by +1 for each previous success.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the character fails one of these 건강 checks, she begins to suffocate. In the first round, she falls
            unconscious (0 히트 포인트). In the following round, she drops to –1 히트 포인트 and is 죽어가고 있음. In

              A Medium character can breathe easily for 6 hours in a sealed chamber measuring 10 feet on a side. After
              that time, the character takes 1d6 points of 비치명적인 피해 every 15 minutes. Each additional Medium
              character or significant fire source (a torch, for example) proportionally reduces the time the air will

          <p>
            Any character can wade in relatively calm water that isn’t over his head, no check required. Similarly,
            swimming in calm water only requires 스킬 판정 with a DC of 10. Trained swimmers can just take 10.
            (Remember, however, that 갑옷 or heavy gear makes any attempt at swimming much more difficult. See 수영
            skill 묘사<span style="font-style: italic">.</span>)
          </p>
          <p>
            By contrast, fast-moving water is much more dangerous. On a successful DC 15 수영 check or a DC 15 근력
            check, it deals 1d3 points of 비치명적인 피해 per round (1d6 points of lethal 피해 if flowing over rocks and
            cascades). On a failed check, the character must make another check that round to avoid going under.
          </p>
          <p>
            Very deep water is not only generally pitch black, posing a navigational hazard, but worse, it deals water
            pressure 피해 of 1d6 points per minute for every 100 feet the character is below the surface. A successful
            Fortitude save (DC 15, +1 for each previous check) means the diver takes no 피해 in that minute. Very cold
            water deals 1d6 points of 비치명적인 피해 from hypothermia per minute of exposure.

              Any character can hold her breath for a number of rounds equal to twice her 건강 score. After this period
              of time, the character must make a DC 10 건강 check every round in order to continue holding her breath.
              Each round, the DC increases by 1.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the character finally fails her 건강 check, she begins to drown. In the first round, she falls
              unconscious (0 hp). In the following round, she drops to –1 히트 포인트 and is 죽어가고 있음. In the third
              round, she drowns.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is possible to drown in substances other than water, such as sand, quicksand, fine dust, and silos full

\u003cp\u003e\n            The four basic dungeon types are defined by their current 상태확인. Many 던전 are variations on these basic\n            types or combinations of more than one of them. Sometimes old 던전 are used again and again by different\n            inhabitants for different 목적.\n          \u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003cp\u003e\n            \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 700\"\u003eRuined Structure:\u003c/span\n            \u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n              Once occupied, this place is now abandoned (completely or in part) by its original creator or creators,\n              and other creatures have wandered in. Many subterranean creatures look for abandoned underground 제작 in\n              which to make their lairs. Any 함정 that might exist have probably been set off, but wandering beasts\n              might very well be common.\u003c/span\n            \u003e\n          \u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003cp\u003e\n            \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 700\"\u003eOccupied Structure:\u003c/span\n            \u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n              This type of dungeon is still in use. Creatures (usually intelligent) live there, although they may not be\n              the dungeon’s creators. An occupied structure might be a home, a fortress, a temple, an active mine, a\n              prison, or a headquarters. This type of dungeon is less likely to have 함정 or wandering beasts, and more\n              likely to have organized guards—both on watch and on patrol. 함정 or wandering beasts that might be\n              encountered are usually under the control of the occupants. Occupied structures have furnishings to suit\n              the inhabitants, as well as decorations, supplies, and the ability for occupants to 이동 around (문 they\n              can open, hallways large enough for them to pass through, and so on). The inhabitants might have a\n              communication system, and they almost certainly control an access to the outside.\u003c/span\n            \u003e\n          \u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003cp\u003e\n            Some 던전 are partially occupied and partially empty or in 파멸. In such cases, the occupants are typically\n            not the original builders but instead a group of intelligent creatures that have set up their base, lair, or\n            fortification within an abandoned dungeon.\n          \u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003cp\u003e\n            \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 700\"\u003eSafe Storage: \u003c/span\n            \u003e\u003cspan\n              \u003eWhen people want to protect something, they might bury it underground. Whether the item they want to\n              protect is a fabulous 전리품, a forbidden artifact, or 죽음 body of an important figure, these\n              valuable objects are placed within a dungeon and surrounded by barriers, 함정, and guardians.\u003c/span\n            \u003e\n          \u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003cp\u003e\n            The safe storage type of dungeon is the most likely to have 함정 but the least likely to have wandering\n            beasts. This type of dungeon normally is built for function rather than appearance, but sometimes it has\n            ornamentation in the form of statuary or painted 벽. This is particularly true of the tombs of important\n            people.\n          \u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003cp\u003e\n            Sometimes, however, a vault or a crypt is constructed in such a way as to house living guardians. The\n            problem with this strategy is that something must be done to keep the creatures alive between intrusion\n            attempts. Magic is usually the best solution to provide food and water for these creatures. Even if there’s\n            no way anything living can survive in a safe storage dungeon, certain 몬스터 can still serve as guardians.\n            Builders of vaults or tombs often place undead creatures or constructs, both of which which have no need for\n            생활 유지 or rest, to guard their 던전. 마법 함정 can 공격 intruders by summoning 몬스터 into the dungeon.\n            These guardians also need no 생활 유지, since they appear only when they’re needed and disappear when their\n            task is done.\n          \u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003cp\u003e\n            \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 700\"\u003eNatural Cavern Complex:\u003c/span\n            \u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n              Underground caves provide homes for all sorts of subterranean 몬스터. Created naturally and connected by a\n              labyrinthine tunnel system, these caverns lack any sort of pattern, order, or decoration. With no\n              intelligent force behind its 제작, this type of dungeon is the least likely to have 함정 or even 문.\u003c/span\n            \u003e\n          \u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003cp\u003e\n            Fungi of all sorts thrive in caves, sometimes growing in huge forests of mushrooms and puffballs.\n            Subterranean predators prowl these forests, looking for those feeding upon the fungi. Some varieties of 버섯\n            give off a phosphorescent glow, providing a natural cavern complex with its own limited 빛 source. In other\n            범위, a \u003cspan style=\"font-style: italic\"\u003e햇살 \u003c/span\u003espell or similar magical effect can provide enough 빛\n            for green plants to grow.\n          \u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003cp\u003e\n            Often, a natural cavern complex connects with another type of 던전, the caves having been discovered when\n            the manufactured dungeon was delved. A cavern complex can connect two otherwise unrelated 던전, sometimes\n            creating a strange mixed 환경. A natural cavern complex joined with another dungeon often provides a route\n            by which subterranean creatures find their way into a manufactured dungeon and populate it.\n          \u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003c/section\u003e\n      \u003c/section\u003e\n      \u003csection id=\"h2-3-dungeon-terrain\"\u003e\n        \u003ch2\u003e던전 지형\u003c/h2\u003e\n        \u003cdiv class=\"original-headline\"\u003eDUNGEON TERRAIN\u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003csection id=\"h3-4-walls\"\u003e\n          \u003ch3\u003e벽\u003c/h3\u003e\n          \u003cdiv class=\"original-headline\"\u003eWALLS\u003c/div\u003e\n          \u003cp\u003e\n            Sometimes, masonry 벽—stones piled on top of each other (usually but not always held in place with\n            mortar)—divide 던전 into 통로 and chambers. Dungeon 벽 can also be hewn from solid rock, leaving them with a\n            rough, chiseled look. Or, dungeon 벽 can be the smooth, unblemished stone of a naturally occurring cave.\n            Dungeon 벽 are difficult to break down or through, but they’re generally easy to 등반.\n          \u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003cdiv class=\"table-container\"\u003e\n            \u003ctable style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

A\n              typical 1-inch-thick iron grate has 25 히트 포인트, hardness 10, and a DC of 27 for 근력 checks to break\n              through it or tear it loose.\u003c/span\n            \u003e\n          \u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003cp\u003e\n            \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 700\"\u003eLedge: \u003c/span\n            \u003e\u003cspan\n              \u003eLedges allow creatures to walk above some lower 범위.

By contrast, padlocks are not built-in but\n              usually 달리기 through two 반지, one on the door and the other on the wall. More complex locks, such as\n              combination locks and puzzle locks, are usually built into the door itself. Because such keyless locks are\n              larger and more complex, they are typically only found in sturdy 문(strong wooden, stone, or iron\n              문).\u003c/span\n            \u003e\n          \u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003cp\u003e\n            자물쇠 열기 DC to pick a lock often falls into 거리 of 20 to 30, although locks with lower or higher\n            DCs can exist.

A city,\n              on the other hand, is held together by a code of laws, many of which are explicitly designed to prevent\n              the sort of behavior that adventurers engage in all the time: killing and looting. Even so, most cities’\n              laws recognize 몬스터 as a threat to the stability the city relies on, and prohibitions about murder\n              rarely apply to 몬스터 such as aberrations or evil outsiders. Most evil humanoids, however, are typically\n              protected by the same laws that protect all the citizens of the city. Having an evil 성향 is not a crime\n              (except in some severely theocratic cities, perhaps, with the magical power to back up the law); only evil\n              deeds are against the law. Even when adventurers encounter an evildoer in the act of perpetrating some\n              heinous evil upon the populace of the city, the law tends to frown on the sort of vigilante justice that\n              leaves the evildoer 죽음 or otherwise unable to testify at a trial.\u003c/span\n            \u003e\n          \u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003csection id=\"h4-37-weapon-and-spell-restrictions\"\u003e\n            \u003ch4\u003e무기 및 주문 제한\u003c/h4\u003e\n            \u003cdiv class=\"original-headline\"\u003eWeapon And Spell Restrictions\u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003e\n              Different cities have different laws about such issues as carrying 무기 in public and restricting\n              spellcasters.\n            \u003c/p\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003e\n              The city’s laws may not affect all characters equally.

To\n                fire a heavy catapult, the crew chief makes a special check against DC 15 using only his base 공격\n                보너스, 지능 수정치, 거리 increment 페널티, and the appropriate 수정치 from the lower section of\n                Table 3–26. If the check succeeds, the catapult stone hits the square the catapult was aimed at, dealing\n                the indicated 피해 to any object or character in the square. Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Reflex\n                save take half 피해. Once a catapult stone hits a square, subsequent shots hit the same square unless\n                the catapult is reaimed or the wind changes direction or 속도.\u003c/span\n              \u003e\n            \u003c/p\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003e\n              If a catapult stone misses, roll 1d8 to determine where it lands.

Similarly,\n            swimming in calm water only requires 스킬 판정 with a DC of 10. Trained swimmers can just take 10.\n            (Remember, however, that 갑옷 or heavy gear makes any attempt at swimming much more difficult.

On a successful DC 15 수영 check or a DC 15 근력\n            check, it deals 1d3 points of 비치명적인 피해 per round (1d6 points of lethal 피해 if flowing over rocks and\n            cascades).

A successful\n            Fortitude save (DC 15, +1 for each previous check) means the diver takes no 피해 in that minute.
