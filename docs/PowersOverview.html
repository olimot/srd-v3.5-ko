      <h1>사이오닉 파워 개요</h1>
      <div class="original-headline">PSIONIC POWERS OVERVIEW</div>
      <p>
        사이오닉 파워 spring from sentient minds. Even an undead creature or a being that has no physical form can
        create a reserve of inner 근력 necessary to manifest powers, as long as it has an 지능 score of at least 1.
        Vermin possessed of a hive mind ability are an exception to this rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        A psionic power is a one-time psionic effect. Psionic characters and creatures need not prepare their powers for
        use ahead of time. They either have sufficient 파워 포인트 to manifest a power or they do not.
      </p>
      <p>
        A power is manifested when a psionic character pays its power point cost. Some 사이오닉 생명체 automatically
        manifest powers, called 유사사이오닉 능력, without paying a power point cost. Other creatures pay 파워 포인트 to
        manifest their powers, just as characters do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each power has a specific effect. A power known to a psionic character can be used whenever he or she has 파워
        포인트 to pay for it.
      </p>
      <section id="h3-1-manifesting-powers">
        <h3>파워 구현</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">MANIFESTING POWERS</div>
        <p>
          Psionic characters and creatures manifest powers. Whether they cost 파워 포인트 when manifest by a psionic
          character, or are manifested as 유사사이오닉 능력, powers’ effects remain the same. The process of manifesting
          a power is akin to casting a spell, but with significant differences.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="h3-2-choosing-a-power">
        <h3>파워 선택하기</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">CHOOSING A POWER</div>
        <p>
          First you must choose which power to manifest. You can select any power you know, provided you are capable of
          파워 구현 of that 레벨 or higher. To manifest a power, you must pay 파워 포인트, which count against your
          daily total. You can manifest the same power multiple times if you have points left to pay for it.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="h3-3-concentration">
        <h3>집중</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">CONCENTRATION</div>
        <p>
          To manifest a power, you must concentrate. If something threatens to interrupt your 집중 while you’re
          manifesting a power, you must succeed on a 집중 check or lose 파워 포인트 without manifesting the power. The
          more distracting the interruption and the higher 레벨 of the power that you are trying to manifest, the higher
          the DC. (Higher-레벨 powers require more mental effort.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Injury:</b><span>
            Getting hurt or being affected by hostile 사이오닉 while trying to manifest a power can break your 집중 and
            파멸 a power. If you take 피해 while trying to manifest a power, you must make a 집중 check (DC 10 + points
            of 피해 taken + 레벨 of the power you’re manifesting). The interrupting event strikes during manifestation
            if it occurs between when you start and when you complete manifesting a power (for a power with a 구현 시간
            of 1 round or longer) or if it comes in response to your manifesting the power (such as an 공격 of
            opportunity provoked by the manifesting of the power or a contingent 공격 from a readied action).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are taking continuous 피해 half 피해 is considered to take place while you are manifesting a power. You
          must make a 집중 check (DC 10 + 1/2 피해 that the continuous source last dealt + 레벨 of the power you’re
          manifesting).
        </p>
        <p>
          If the last 피해 dealt was the last 피해 that the effect could deal then 피해 is over, and it does not
          주의산만 you.
        </p>
        <p>Repeated 피해 does not count as continuous 피해.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Power:</b><span>
            If you are affected by a power while attempting to manifest a power of your own, you must make a 집중 check
            or lose the power you are manifesting. If the power affecting you deals 피해, 집중 DC is 10 + points of 피해
            + 레벨 of the power you’re manifesting. If the power interferes with you or 주의산만 you in some other way,
            집중 DC is the power’s save DC + 레벨 of the power you’re manifesting. For a power with no 내성 굴림, it’s
            the DC that the power’s 내성 굴림 would have if a save were allowed.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Grappling or Pinned:</b><span>
            To manifest a power while grappling or pinned, you must make a 집중 check (DC 20 + 레벨 of the power you’re
            manifesting) or lose the power.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Vigorous Motion: </b><span>If you are riding on a moving 탈것 소환, taking a bouncy 탑승 in a wagon, on a small boat in rough water,
            belowdecks in a storm-tossed ship, or simply being jostled in a similar fashion, you must make a 집중 check
            (DC 10 + 레벨 of the power you’re manifesting) or lose the power.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Violent Motion: </b><span>If you are on a galloping 말, taking a very rough 탑승 in a wagon, on a small boat in rapids or in a storm,
            on deck in a storm-tossed ship, or being tossed roughly about in a similar fashion, you must make a 집중
            check (DC 15 + 레벨 of the power you’re manifesting) or lose the power.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Violent 날씨: </b><span>If you are in a high wind carrying blinding rain or sleet, the DC is 5 + 레벨 of the power you’re
            manifesting. If you are in wind-driven hail, dust, or debris, the DC is 10 + 레벨 of the power you’re
            manifesting. In either case, you lose the power if you fail 집중 check. If 날씨 is caused by a power, use
            the rules in the Power subsection above.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>파워 구현 on the Defensive:</b><span>
            If you want to manifest a power without provoking 기회 공격, you need to 회피 and weave. You must make a
            집중 check (DC 15 + 레벨 of the power you’re manifesting) to succeed. You lose 파워 포인트 without
            successful manifestation if you fail.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Entangled:</b><span>
            If you want to manifest a power while entangled in a net or while affected by a power with similar effects
            you must make a DC 15 집중 check to manifest the power. You lose the power if you fail.</span>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="h3-4-manifester-level">
        <h3>구현자 레벨</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">MANIFESTER LEVEL</div>
        <p>
          The variables of a power’s effect often depend on its 구현자 레벨, which is equal to your psionic class 레벨.
          A power that can be augmented for additional effect is also limited by your 구현자 레벨(you can’t spend more
          파워 포인트 on a power than your 구현자 레벨). See Augment under 설명 문구, below.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can manifest a power at a lower 구현자 레벨 than normal, but 구현자 레벨 must be high enough for you to
          manifest the power in question, and all 레벨-dependent features must be based on the same 구현자 레벨.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event that a class feature or other special ability provides an adjustment to your 구현자 레벨, this
          adjustment applies not only to all effects based on 구현자 레벨(such as 거리, 지속시간, and augmentation
          potential) but also to your 구현자 레벨 check to overcome your target’s 파워 저항 and to 구현자 레벨 used in
          dispel checks (both the dispel check and the DC of the check).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="h3-5-power-failure">
        <h3>파워 실패</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">POWER FAILURE</div>
        <p>
          If you try to manifest a power in 상태이상 where the characteristics of the power (거리, 범위, and so on)
          cannot be made to conform, the manifestation fails and 파워 포인트 are wasted.
        </p>
        <p>Powers also fail if your 집중 is broken (see 집중, above).</p>
      </section>
      <section id="h3-6-the-power-s-result">
        <h3>파워의 결과</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">THE POWER’S RESULT</div>
        <p>
          Once you know which creatures (or objects or 범위) are affected, and whether those creatures have made
          successful 내성 굴림(if any were allowed), you can apply whatever results a power entails.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="h3-7-special-power-effects">
        <h3>특수 파워 효과</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">SPECIAL POWER EFFECTS</div>
        <p>Certain special features apply to all powers.</p>
        <p>
          <b>공격:</b><span>
            Some powers refer to attacking. All offensive 전투 actions, even those that don’t 피해 opponents, such as
            무장해제 and 황소 쇄도, are considered 공격. All powers that opponents can resist with 내성 굴림, that deal
            피해, or that otherwise 해악 or hamper subjects are considered 공격.
            <i>영적 구조물 </i>and similar powers are not considered 공격 because the
            powers themselves don’t 해악 anyone.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>보너스 Types:</b><span>
            Many powers give creatures 보너스 to 능력 점수, 방어도, 공격, and other attributes. Each 보너스 has a type
            that indicates how the power grants 보너스. The important aspect of 보너스 types is that two 보너스 of the
            same type don’t generally stack. With the exception of 회피 보너스, most circumstance 보너스, and racial
            보너스, only the better 보너스 works (see 사이오닉과 마법 효과 조합하기, below). The same principle applies
            to 페널티—a character taking two or more 페널티 of the same type applies only the worst one.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Bringing Back 죽음:</b><span>
            Of all 사이오닉 파워, only <i>현실 수정 </i>has the ability to restore
            slain characters to life. When a living creature dies, its soul departs the body, leaves 물질 세계, travels
            through 영적 세계, and goes to abide on the plane where the creature’s deity resides. If the creature did
            not worship a deity, its soul departs to the plane corresponding to its 성향. Bringing someone back from the
            죽음 means retrieving his or her soul and returning it to his or her body.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>레벨 손실: </i><span>The passage from life to death and back again is a wrenching journey for a being’s soul. Consequently, any
            creature brought back to life usually loses one 레벨 of experience. The character’s new experience point
            total is midway between the minimum needed for his or her new (reduced) 레벨 and the minimum needed for the
            next one. If the character was 1 레벨 at the time of death, he or she loses 2 points of 건강 instead of
            losing a 레벨. This 레벨 손실 or 건강 loss cannot be repaired by any mortal means, even 주문
            <i>소원 </i>or <i>기적</i>. A revived
            character can regain a lost 레벨 by earning XP through further adventuring. A revived character who was 1
            레벨 at the time of death can regain lost points of 건강 by improving his or her 건강 score when he or she
            attains a 레벨 that allows an ability score increase.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Preventing Revivif cation: </i><span>Enemies can take steps to make it more difficult for a character to be returned from 죽음. Keeping the body
            prevents others from using a single manifestation of <i>현실 수정 </i>to
            restore the slain character to life.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Revivif cation Against One’s Will: </i><span>A soul cannot be returned to life if it does not 소원 to be. A soul knows 이름, 성향, and patron deity (if
            any) of the character attempting to revive it and may refuse to return on that basis.</span>

        <h3>사이오닉과 마법 효과 조합하기</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">COMBINING PSIONIC AND MAGICAL EFFECTS</div>
        <p>
          The default rule for the interaction of 사이오닉 and magic is simple: Powers interact with 주문 and 주문
          interact with powers in the same way a spell or normal spell-like ability interacts with another spell or
          spell-like ability. This is known as 사이오닉–magic transparency.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>사이오닉–Magic Transparency:</b><span>
            Though not explicitly called out in 주문 설명 or 마법 아이템 설명<i>, </i>주문, spell-like 능력, and 마법 아이템 that could potentially affect 사이오닉 do affect 사이오닉.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>When the rule about 사이오닉–magic transparency is in effect, it has the following ramifications.</p>
        <p>
          주문 저항 is effective against powers, using the same mechanics. Likewise, 파워 저항 is effective against
          주문, using the same mechanics as 주문 저항. If a creature has one kind of 저항, it is assumed to have the
          other. (The effects have similar ends despite having been brought about by different means.)
        </p>
        <p>
          All 주문 that 마법 무효화 have equal effect against powers of the same 레벨 using the same mechanics, and vice
          versa.
        </p>
        <p>
          The spell <i>마법 감지 </i>detects powers, their number, and their 근력 and
          location within 3 rounds (though a 사이크래프트 check is necessary to 식별 분야 of the psionic aura).
        </p>
        <p>죽음 magic 범위 are also 죽음 사이오닉 범위.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Multiple Effects:</b><span>
            Powers or psionic effects usually work as described no matter how many other powers, psionic effects, 주문,
            or magical effects happen to be operating in the same 범위 or on the same recipient. Except in special
            cases, a power does not affect the way another power or spell operates. Whenever a power has a specific
            effect on other powers or 주문, the power 묘사 explains the effect (and vice versa for 주문 that affect
            powers). Several other general rules apply when powers, 주문, magical effects, or psionic effects operate in
            the same place.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Stacking Effects:</b><span>
            Powers that provide 보너스 or 페널티 on 명중 굴림, 피해 rolls, 내성 굴림, and other attributes usually do
            not stack with themselves. More generally, two 보너스 of the same type don’t stack even if they come from
            different powers, or one from a power and one from a spell. You use whichever 보너스 gives you the better
            result.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Different 보너스 Types</i><span>: 보너스 or 페널티 from two different powers, or a power and a spell, stack if the effects are of different
            types. 보너스 that isn’t named (just a “+2 보너스” rather than a “+2 insight 보너스”) stacks with any
            보너스.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Same Effect More than Once in Different 근력</i><span>: In cases when two or more similar or identical effects are operating in the same 범위 or on the same
            target, but at different 근력, only the best one applies. If one power or spell is dispelled or its 지속시간
            달리기 out, the other power or spell remains in effect (assuming its 지속시간 has not yet expired).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Same Effect with Differing Results</i><span>: The same power or spell can sometimes produce varying effects if applied to the same recipient more than
            once. The last effect in a series trumps the others. None of the previous 주문 or powers are actually
            removed or dispelled, but their effects become irrelevant while the final spell or power in the series
            lasts.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>One Effect Makes Another Irrelevant: </i><span>Sometimes, a power can render another power irrelevant.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Multiple Mental Control Effects</i><span>: Sometimes psionic or magical effects that establish mental control render one another irrelevant. Mental
            controls that don’t remove the recipient’s ability to act usually do not interfere with one another, though
            one may modify another. If a creature is under the control of two or more creatures, it tends to obey each
            to the best of its ability, and to the extent of the control each effect allows. If the controlled creature
            receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the competing controllers must make opposed 매력 checks to
            determine which one the creature obeys.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Powers and 주문 with Opposite Effects:</b><span>
            Powers and 주문 with opposite effects apply normally, with all 보너스, 페널티, or changes accruing in the
            order that they apply. Some powers and 주문 negate or counter each other. This is a special effect that is
            noted in a power’s or spell’s 묘사.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Instantaneous Effects:</b><span>
            Two or more magical or psionic effects with instantaneous 지속시간 work cumulatively when they affect the
            same object, place, or creature.

        <div class="original-headline">POWERS AND POWER POINTS</div>
        <p>
          Psionic characters manifest powers, which involve the direct manipulation of personal mental energy. These
          manipulations require natural talent and personal meditation. A psionic character’s 레벨 limits the number of
          파워 포인트 available to manifest powers. A psionic character’s relevant high score might allow him to gain
          extra 파워 포인트. He can manifest the same power more than once, but each manifestation subtracts 파워 포인트
          from his daily limit. Manifesting a power is an arduous mental task. To do so, a psionic character must have a
          핵심 능력 score of at least 10 + the power’s 레벨.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Daily Power Point Acquisition:</b><span>
            To regain used daily 파워 포인트, a psionic character must have a clear mind. To clear his mind, he must
            first 수면 for 8 hours. The character does not have to slumber for every minute of the time, but he must
            refrain from 이동, 전투, 파워 구현, skill use, conversation, or any other demanding physical or mental task
            during the rest period. If his rest is interrupted, each interruption adds 1 hour to the total amount of
            time he has to rest to clear his mind, and he must have at least 1 hour of rest immediately prior to
            regaining lost 파워 포인트. If the character does not need to 수면 for some reason, he still must have 8
            hours of restful calm before regaining 파워 포인트.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Recent Manifesting Limit/Rest Interruptions:</b><span>
            If a psionic character has manifested powers recently, the drain on his resources reduces his capacity to
            regain 파워 포인트. When he regains 파워 포인트 for the coming day, all 파워 포인트 he has used within the
            last 8 hours count against his daily limit.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Peaceful 환경: </b><span>To regain 파워 포인트, a psionic character must have enough peace, quiet, and comfort to allow for proper
            집중. The psionic character’s surroundings need not be luxurious, but they must be free from overt
            distractions, such as 전투 raging nearby or other loud noises. Exposure to inclement 날씨 prevents the
            necessary 집중, as does any injury or failed 내성 굴림 the character might incur while concentrating on
            regaining 파워 포인트.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Regaining 파워 포인트:</b><span>
            Once the character has rested in a suitable 환경, it takes only an act of 집중 spanning 1 full round to
            regain all 파워 포인트 of the psionic character’s daily limit.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Death and 파워 포인트:</b><span>
            If a character dies, all daily 파워 포인트 stored in his mind are wiped away. A potent effect (such as
            <i>현실 수정</i>) can recover the lost 파워 포인트 when it recovers the
            character.</span>

            Psionic characters can learn new powers when they attain a new 레벨. A 사이언 can learn any power from the
            사이언/와일더 list and powers from his chosen 분야’s list. A 와일더 can learn any power from the
            사이언/와일더 list. A 사이킥 군인 can learn any power from 사이킥 군인 list.

          <p>
            <b>Powers Gained at a New 레벨: </b><span>사이언 and other psionic characters 공연 a certain amount of personal meditation between adventures in an
              attempt to unlock latent mental 능력. Each time a psionic character attains a new 레벨, he or she learns
              additional powers according to his class 묘사. 사이언, 사이킥 군인, and 와일더 learn new powers of their
              choice in this fashion. These powers represent 능력 unlocked from latency. The powers must be of 레벨 the
              characters can manifest.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Independent Research:</b><span>
              A 사이언 also can research a power independently, duplicating an existing power or creating an entirely
              new one. If characters are allowed to develop new powers, use these guidelines to handle the
              situation.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Any kind of manifester can create a new power. The research involved requires access to a retreat conducive
            to uninterrupted meditation. Research involves an expenditure of 200 XP per week and takes one week per 레벨
            of the power. At the end of that time, the character makes a 사이크래프트 check (DC 10 + spell 레벨). If
            that check succeeds, the character learns the new power if her research produced a viable power. If the
            check fails, the character must go through the research process again if she wants to keep trying.

            <div class="original-headline">Manifest an Unknown Power from Another’s Powers Known</div>
            <p>
              A psionic character can attempt to manifest a power from a source other than his own 지식(usually a power
              stone or another willing psionic character). To do so, the character must first make contact (a process
              similar to addressing a power stone, requiring a 사이크래프트 check against a DC of 15+ 레벨 of the power
              to be manifested). A psionic character can make contact with only a willing psionic character or creature
              (unconscious creatures are considered willing, but not psionic characters under the effects of other
              immobilizing 상태이상). Characters who can’t use 파워스톤 for any reason are also banned from attempting
              to manifest powers from 지식 of other psionic characters. Mental contact requires 1 full round of physical
              contact, which can provoke 기회 공격. Once contact is achieved, the character becomes aware of all the
              powers stored in the power stone or all the powers the other character knows up to the highest 레벨 of
              power the contactor knows himself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, the psionic character must choose one of the powers and make a second 사이크래프트 check (DC 15 +
              the power’s 레벨) to see if he understands it. If the power is not on his class list, he automatically
              fails this check.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon successfully making contact with another willing psionic character or creature and learning what he
              can of one power in particular, the character can immediately attempt to manifest that power even if he
              doesn’t know it (and assuming he has 파워 포인트 left for the day). He can attempt to manifest the power
              normally on his next turn, and he succeeds if he makes one additional 사이크래프트 check (DC 15 + the
              power’s 레벨). He retains the ability to manifest the selected power for only 1 round. If he doesn’t
              manifest the power, fails 사이크래프트 check, or manifests a different power, he loses his chance to
              manifest that power for the day.

            A variety of 사이오닉 아이템 exist to store 파워 포인트 for later use, in particular a storage device called
            a <i>cognizance crystal</i>. Regardless of what sort of item stores the
            파워 포인트, all psionic characters must follow strict rules when tapping stored 파워 포인트.

          <p>
            <b>A Single Source: </b><span>When using 파워 포인트 from a storage item to manifest a power, a psionic character may not pay the
              power’s cost with 파워 포인트 from more than one source. He must either use an item, his own power point
              reserve, or some other discrete power point source to pay the manifestation cost.

          </p>

            <b>Recharging: </b><span>Most power point storage devices allow psionic characters to “recharge” the item with their own 파워

              a power; however, those 파워 포인트 remain indefinitely stored. The opposite is not true—psionic
              characters may not use 파워 포인트 stored in a storage item to replenish their own power point

          사이오닉 생명체 can create psionic effects without having 레벨 in a psionic class (although they can take a
          psionic class to further enhance their 능력); such creatures have 사이오닉 하위 유형.
        </p>
        <p>
          Characters using 도르제, <i>인식의 결정, </i>and other 사이오닉 아이템 can
          also create psionic effects. In addition to existing spell-like and supernatural 능력, creatures can also have
          유사사이오닉 능력. (사이오닉 생명체 may also have extraordinary and natural 능력.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>유사사이오닉 능력(Ps):</b><span>
            The manifestation of powers by a psionic character is considered a psi-like ability, as is the manifestation
            of powers by creatures without a psionic class (creatures with 사이오닉 하위 유형, also simply called
            사이오닉 생명체). Usually, a psionic creature’s psi-like ability works just like the power of that 이름. A
            few 유사사이오닉 능력 are unique; these are explained in the text where they are described.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          유사사이오닉 능력 have no verbal, somatic, or material 구성요소, nor do they require a focus or have an XP
          cost (even if the equivalent power has an XP cost). The user activates them mentally. 갑옷 never affects a
          psi-like ability’s use. A psi-like ability has a 구현 시간 of 1 standard action unless noted otherwise in the
          ability 묘사. In all other ways, a psi-like ability functions just like a power. However, a psionic creature
          does not have to pay a psi-like ability’s power point cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          유사사이오닉 능력 are subject to 파워 저항 and to being dispelled by

        <p>
          <b>Ability Burn:</b><span>
            This is a special form of ability 피해 that cannot be magically or psionically healed. It is caused by the
            use of certain 사이오닉 특기 and powers. It returns only through natural 치료.</span>

        </p>
        <p>
          A psionic cascade is a loss of control over psionic 능력. Using 파워 포인트 becomes dangerous for a character
          infected by cascade flu, once the incubation period has 달리기 its course. Every time an afflicted character
          manifests a power, she must make a DC 16 집중 check. On a failed check, a psionic cascade is triggered. The
          power operates normally, but during the following round, without the character’s volition, two additional
          powers she knows manifest randomly, and their power cost is deducted from the character’s reserve. During the
          next round, three additional powers manifest, and so on, until all the psionic character’s 파워 포인트 are
          drained. Powers with a 거리 of personal or touch always affect the diseased character. For other powers that
          affect targets, roll d%: On a 01–50 result, the power affects the diseased character, and 51–00 indicates that
          the power targets other creatures in the vicinity. 사이오닉 생명체(those that manifest their powers without
          paying points) cascade until all the powers they know have manifested at least twice.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with any 질병, a psionic character who is injured or attacked by a creature carrying a 질병 or parasite, or
          who otherwise has contact with contaminated material, must make an immediate Fortitude save. On a success, the
          질병 fails to gain a foothold. On a failure, the character takes 피해(or incurs the specified effect) after
          the incubation period. Once per day afterward, the afflicted character must make a successful Fortitude save
          to avoid repeating 피해. Two successful 내성 굴림 in a row indicate she has fought off 질병.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>질병, Cerebral Parasites:</b><span>
            Spread by contact with infected 사이오닉 생명체; contact; DC 15; incubation 1d4 days; 피해 1d8 파워 포인트.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Cerebral parasites are tiny organisms, undetectable to normal sight. An afflicted character may not even know
          he carries the parasites—until he discovers he has fewer 파워 포인트 for the day than expected. 사이오닉
          생명체 with cerebral parasites are limited to using each of their known powers only once per day (instead of
          freely manifesting them). See the note about 질병 under Cascade Flu, above.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Negative 레벨:</b><span>
            Psionic characters can gain negative 레벨 just like members of other character classes. A psionic character
            loses access to one power per negative 레벨 from the highest 레벨 of power he can manifest; he also loses a
            number of 파워 포인트 equal to the cost of that power. If two or more powers fit these criteria, the
            manifester decides which one becomes inaccessible. The lost power becomes available again as soon the
            negative 레벨 is removed, providing the manifester is capable of using it at that time. Lost 파워 포인트
            also return.</span>

            Every power is associated with one of six 분야. A 분야 is a group of related powers that work in similar
            ways. Each of 분야 is discussed below.

          <h3>초감각</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">Clairsentience</div>
          <p>
            초감각 powers enable you to learn secrets long forgotten, to glimpse the immediate future and predict the
            far future, to find hidden objects, and to know what is normally unknowable.
          </p>
          <p>
            For 목적 of 사이오닉–magic transparency, 초감각 powers are equivalent to powers of 점술 학파(thus, creatures
            immune to 점술 주문 are also immune to 초감각 powers).
          </p>
          <p>
            Many 초감각 powers have cone-shaped 범위. These 이동 with you and extend in the direction you look. The cone
            defines 범위 that you can sweep each round. If you study the same 범위 for multiple rounds, you can often
            gain additional information, as noted in 설명 문구 for the power.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>염탐:</b><span>
              A power of 염탐 subdiscipline creates an invisible sensor that sends you information. Unless noted
              otherwise, the sensor has the same powers of sensory acuity that you possess. This includes any powers or
              effects that target you, but not powers or effects that emanate from you. However, the sensor is treated
              as a separate, independent sensory organ of yours, and thus functions normally even if you have been
              blinded, deafened, or otherwise suffered sensory impairment. Any creature with an 지능 score of 12 or
              higher can notice the sensor by making a DC 20 지능 check. The sensor can be dispelled as if it were an
              active power. Lead sheeting or psionic protection blocks 염탐 powers, and you sense that the power is so
              blocked.</span>

          <div class="original-headline">Metacreativity</div>
          <p>
            재귀창조 powers 물체 생성, creatures, or some form of matter. Creatures you create usually, but not always,
            obey your 명령.
          </p>
          <p>
            A 재귀창조 power draws raw ectoplasm from 영적 세계 to create an object or creature in the place the psionic
            character designates (subject to the limits noted above). Objects created in this fashion are as solid and
            durable as normal objects, despite their originally diaphanous substance. 사이오닉 생명체 created with
            재귀창조 powers are considered constructs, not outsiders.
          </p>
          <p>
            A creature or object brought into being cannot appear inside another creature or object, nor can it appear
            floating in an empty space. It must arrive in an open location on a surface capable of supporting it. The
            creature or object must appear within the power’s 거리, but it does not have to remain within 거리.
          </p>
          <p>
            For 목적 of 사이오닉–magic transparency, 재귀창조 powers are equivalent to powers of 소환술 학파 (thus,
            creatures immune to 소환술 주문 are also immune to 재귀창조 powers).
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Creation:</b><span>
              A power of the creation subdiscipline creates an object or creature in the place the manifester designates
              (subject to the limits noted above). If the power has a 지속시간 other than instantaneous, psionic energy
              holds the creation together, and when the power ends, the created creature or object vanishes without a
              trace, except for a thin film of glistening ectoplasm that quickly evaporates. If the power has an
              instantaneous 지속시간, the created object or creature is merely assembled through 사이오닉. It lasts
              indefinitely and does not depend on 사이오닉 for its existence.</span>

              A power of the teleportation subdiscipline 운송수단 one or more creatures or objects a great distance. The

              otherwise noted) and not dispellable. Teleportation is instantaneous travel through 영적 세계. Anything

          <p>
            Appearing on the same line as 분야 and subdiscipline (when applicable) is a descriptor that further
            categorizes the power in some way. Some powers have more than one descriptor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The descriptors that apply to powers are acid, cold, death, electricity, evil, fire, force, good,
            language-dependent, 빛, 정신영향계, and sonic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of these descriptors have no game effect by themselves, but they govern how the power interacts with
            other powers, with 주문, with 특수 능력, with unusual creatures, with 성향, and so on.
          </p>
          <p>A language-dependent power uses intelligible language as a medium.</p>

          <div class="original-headline">LEVEL</div>
          <p>
            The next line of the power 묘사 gives a power’s 레벨, a number between 1 and 9 that defines the power’s
            relative 근력. This number is preceded by 이름 of the class whose members can manifest the power. If a power
            is part of a 분야’s list instead of 사이언’s general 파워 목록, this will be indicated by 이름 of 분야’s
            specialist. The specialists a power can be associated with include 에고이스트 (정신적대사작용),
            염동력자(염동력), 유목민(시공간초월), 예언가(초감각), 조형가(재귀창조), and 정신감응가 (정신감응).

          <h3>표시</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">DISPLAY</div>
          <p>
            When a power is manifested, a 표시 may accompany the primary effect. This secondary effect may be auditory,
            material, mental, olfactory, or visual. No power’s 표시 is significant enough to create consequences for the
            사이오닉 생명체, allies, or opponents during 전투. The secondary effect for a power occurs only if the
            power’s 묘사 indicates it. If multiple powers with similar 표시 are in effect simultaneously, 표시 do not
            necessary become more intense. Instead, the overall 표시 remains much the same, though with minute spikes in
            intensity. A 사이크래프트 check (DC 10 + 1 per additional power in use) reveals the exact number of
            simultaneous powers in play.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Dispense with 표시: </i><span>Despite the fact that almost every power has a 표시, a psionic character can always choose to manifest
              the power without the flashy accompaniment. To manifest a power without any 표시(no matter how many 표시
              it might have), a manifester must make a 집중 check (DC 15 + 레벨 of the power). This check is part of the
              action of manifesting the power. If the check is unsuccessful, the power manifests normally with its
              표시.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if a manifester manifests a power without a 표시, he is still subject to 기회 공격 in appropriate
            circumstances. (Of course, another 집중 check can be made as normal to either manifest defensively or
            maintain the power if attacked.)
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Auditory: </b><span>A bass-pitched hum issues from the manifester’s vicinity or in the vicinity of the power’s subject
              (manifester’s choice), eerily akin to many deep-pitched voices. The sound grows in a second from hardly
              noticeable to as loud as a 힘찬 함성 strident enough to be heard within 100 feet. At the manifester’s
              option, the instantaneous sound can be so soft that it can be heard only within 15 feet with a successful
              DC 10 듣기 check. Some powers describe unique auditory 표시.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Material:</b><span>
              The subject or 범위 is briefly slicked with a translucent, shimmering substance. The glistening substance
              evaporates after 1 round regardless of the power’s 지속시간. Sophisticated 사이언 recognize the material
              as ectoplasmic seepage from 영적 세계; this substance is completely inert.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Mental:</b><span>
              A subtle chime 반지 once in the minds of creatures within 15 feet of either the manifester or the subject
              (at the manifester’s option). At the manifester’s option, the chime can ring continuously for the power’s
              지속시간. Some powers describe unique mental 표시.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Olfactory:</b><span>
              An odd but familiar odor brings to mind a brief mental flash of a long-buried memory. 냄새 is difficult to
              pin down, and no two individuals ever describe it the same way. The odor originates from the manifester
              and spreads to a distance of 20 feet, then fades in less than a second (or lasts for the 지속시간, at the
              manifester’s option).</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Visual: </b><span>The manifester’s eyes burn like points of silver fire while the power remains in effect. A rainbow-flash
              of 빛 sweeps away from the manifester to a distance of 5 feet and then dissipates, unless a unique visual
              표시 is described. This is the case when 표시 entry includes “see text,” which means that a visual effect
              is described somewhere in the text of the power.

          <h3>구현 시간</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">MANIFESTING TIME</div>
          <p>
            Most powers have a manifesing time of 1 standard action. Others take 1 round or more, while a few require
            only a free action.
          </p>
          <p>
            A power that takes 1 round to manifest requires a full-round action. It comes into effect just before the
            beginning of your turn in the round after you began manifesting the power. You then act normally after the
            power is completed.
          </p>
          <p>
            A power that takes 1 minute to manifest comes into effect just before your turn 1 minute later (and for each
            of those 10 rounds, you are manifesting a power as a full-round action, as noted above for 1-round 구현
            시간). These actions must be consecutive and uninterrupted, or 파워 포인트 are lost and the power fails.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you use a power that takes 1 round or longer to manifest, you must continue 집중 from the current round
            to just before your turn in the next round (at least). If you lose 집중 before 구현 시간 is complete, 파워
            포인트 are lost and the power fails.
          </p>
          <p>
            You make all pertinent decisions about a power (거리, target, 범위, effect, version, and so forth) when the
            power comes into effect.

          <h3>새로운 행동 유형</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">New Action Types</div>
          <p>
            <b>Swift Action: </b><span>A swift action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort and
              energy than a free action. You can 공연 one swift action per turn without affecting your ability to 공연
              other actions. In that regard, a swift action is like a free action. However, you can 공연 only a single
              swift action per turn, regardless of what other actions you take. You can take a swift action any time you
              would normally be allowed to take a free action. Swift actions usually involve 사이오닉 or the activation
              of 사이오닉 아이템; many characters (especially those who don’t use 사이오닉) never have an opportunity to
              take a swift action.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Manifesting a quickened power is a swift action. In addition, manifesting any power with a 시전 시간 of 1
            swift action is a swift action.
          </p>
          <p>Manifesting a power with a 구현 시간 of 1 swift action does not provoke 기회 공격.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Immediate Action:</b><span>
              Much like a swift action, an immediate action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a
              larger expenditure of effort and energy than a free action. However, unlike a swift action, an immediate
              action can be performed at any time—even if it’s not your turn. Using an immediate action on your turn is
              the same as using a swift action, and counts as your swift action for that turn. You cannot use another
              immediate action or a swift action until after your next turn if you have used an immediate action when it
              is not currently your turn (effectively, using an immediate action before your turn is equivalent to using
              your swift action for the coming turn). You also cannot use an immediate action if you are currently
              flat-footed.</span>

            A power’s 거리 indicates how far from you it can reach, as defined in 거리 entry of the power 묘사. A
            power’s 거리 is the maximum distance from you that the power’s effect can occur, as well as the maximum
            distance at which you can designate the power’s point of origin. If any portion of 범위 would extend beyond
            거리, that 범위 is wasted. Standard 거리 include the following.
          </p>
          <p><b>Personal: </b><span>The power affects only you.</span></p>
          <p>
            <b>Touch:</b><span>
              You must touch a creature or object to affect it. A touch power that deals 피해 can score a critical hit
              just as a weapon can. A touch power threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double 피해
              on a successful critical hit. Some touch powersallow you to touch multiple targets. You can touch as many
              willing targets as you can reach, but all targets of the spell must be touched in the same round that you
              manifest the power.</span>

            If you manifest a targeted power on the wrong type of target the power has no effect. If the target of a
            power is yourself (the power 묘사 has a line that reads “Target: You”), you do not receive a 내성 굴림 and
            파워 저항 does not apply. 내성 굴림 and 파워 저항 lines are omitted from such powers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some powers can be manifested only on willing targets. Declaring yourself as a willing target is something
            that can be done at any time (even if you’re flat-footed or it isn’t your turn). Unconscious creatures are
            automatically considered willing, but a character who is conscious but immobile or helpless (such as one who
            is bound, cowering, grappling, paralyzed, pinned, or stunned) is not automatically willing. 내성 굴림 and
            파워 저항 lines are usually omitted from such powers, since only willing subjects can be targeted.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>효과:</b><span>
              Some powers, such as most 재귀창조 powers, create things rather than affect things that are already
              present. Unless otherwise noted in the power 묘사, you must designate the location where these things are
              to appear, either by seeing it or defining it. 거리 determines how far away an effect can appear, but if
              the effect is mobile, it can 이동 regardless of the power’s 거리 once created.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Ray: </i><span>Some effects are 광선. You aim a ray as if using a ranged weapon, though typically you make a ranged
              touch 공격 rather than a normal ranged 공격. As with a ranged weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an
              invisible creature and hope you hit something. You don’t have to see the creature you’re trying to hit, as
              you do with a targeted power. Intervening creatures and obstacles, however, can block your line of sight
              or provide 엄폐 for the creature you’re aiming at.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If a ray power has a 지속시간, it’s 지속시간 of the effect that the ray causes, not the length of time the
            ray itself persists.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a ray power deals 피해, you can score a critical hit just as if it were a weapon. A ray power threatens a
            critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double 피해 on a successful critical hit.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Spread: </i><span>Some effectsspread out from a point of origin (which may be a grid intersection, or may be the
              manifester) to a distance described in the power. The effect can extend around corners and into 범위 that
              you can’t see. Figure distance by actual distance traveled, taking into account turns the effect may take.
              When determining distance for spread effects, count around 벽, not through them. As with 이동, do not
              trace diagonals across corners. You must designate the point of origin for such an effect (unless the
              effect is centered on you), but you need not have line of effect (see below) to all portions of the
              effect.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>(S) Shapeable: </i><span>If an Effect line ends with “(S)” you can shape the power. A shaped effect can have no dimension smaller
              than 10 feet.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>범위:</b><span>
              Some powers affect an 범위. Sometimes a power 묘사 specifies a specially defined 범위, but usually an 범위
              falls into one of the categories defined below.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of the shape of 범위, you select the point where the power originates, but otherwise you usually
            don’t control which creatures or objects the power affects. The point of origin of a power that affects an
            범위 is always a grid intersection. When determining whether a given creature is within 범위 of a power,
            count out the distance from the point of origin in squares just as you do when moving a character or when
            determining 거리 for a ranged 공격. The only difference is that instead of counting from the center of one
            square to the center of the next, you count from intersection to intersection.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can count diagonally across a square, but every second diagonal counts as 2 squares of distance. If the
            far edge of a square is within the power’s 범위, anything within that square is within the power’s 범위. If
            the power’s 범위 touches only the near edge of a square, however, anything within that square is unaffected
            by the power.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>폭발, Emanation, or Spread: </i><span>Most powers that affect an 범위 function as a 폭발, an emanation, or a spread. In each case, you select
              the power’s point of origin and measure its effect from that point. A 폭발 power affects whatever it
              catches in its 범위, even including creatures that you can’t see. It can’t affect creatures with total
              엄폐 from its point of origin (in other words, its effects don’t extend around corners). The default shape
              for a 폭발 effect is a sphere, but some 폭발 powers are specifically described as cone-shaped.</span>
          </p>
          <p>A 폭발’s 범위 defines how far from the point of origin the power’s effect extends.</p>
          <p>
            An emanation power functions like a 폭발 power, except that the effect continues to radiate from the point
            of origin for 지속시간 of the power.
          </p>
          <p>
            A spread power spreads out like a 폭발 but can turn corners. You select the point of origin, and the power
            spreads out a given distance in all directions. Figure 범위 the power effect fills by taking into account
            any turns the effect takes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Cone, Line, or Sphere: </i><span>Most powers that affect an 범위 have a particular shape, such as a cone, line, or sphere. A cone-shaped
              power shoots away from you in a quarter-circle in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner
              of your square and widens out as it goes. Most cones are either 폭발 or emanations (see above), and thus
              won’t go around corners.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            A line-shaped power shoots away from you in a line in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner
            of your square and extends to the limit of its 거리 or until it strikes a barrier that blocks line of
            effect. A line-shaped power affects all creatures in squares that the line passes through or touches.
          </p>
          <p>
            A sphere-shaped power expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical 범위. Spheres may be 폭발,
            emanations, or spreads.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Other: </i><span>A power can have a unique 범위, as defined in its 묘사.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Line of 효과:</b><span>
              A line of effect is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what a power can affect. A solid barrier
              cancels a line of effect, but it is not blocked by 안개, 암흑, and other factors that limit normal sight.
              You must have a clear line of effect to any target that you manifest a power on or to any space in which
              you 소원 to create an effect. You must have a clear line of effect to the point of origin of any power you
              manifest.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            A 폭발, cone, or emanation power affects only an 범위, creatures, or objects to which it has line of effect
            from its origin (a spherical 폭발’s center point, a cone-shaped 폭발’s starting point, or an emanation’s
            point of origin). An otherwise solid barrier with a hole of at least 1 square foot through it does not block
            a power’s line of effect. Such an opening means that the 5-foot length of wall containing the hole is no
            longer considered a barrier for 목적 of determining a power’s line of effect.

          <h3>지속시간</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">DURATION</div>
          <p>A power’s 지속시간 line tells you how long the psionic energy of the power lasts.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Timed 지속시간:</b><span>
              Many 지속시간 are measured in rounds, minutes, hours, or some other increment. When the time is up, the
              psionic energy sustaining the effect fades, and the power ends. If a power’s 지속시간 is variable it is
              rolled secretly.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Instantaneous: </b><span>The psionic energy comes and goes the instant the power is manifested, though the consequences might be
              long-lasting.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Permanent: </b><span>The energy remains as long as the effect does. This means the power is vulnerable to
              <i>사이오닉 무효화</i>.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>집중:</b><span>
              The power lasts as long as you concentrate on it. Concentrating to maintain a power is a standard action
              that does not provoke 기회 공격. Anything that could break your 집중 when manifesting a power can also
              break your 집중 while you’re maintaining one, causing the power to end. You can’t manifest a power while
              concentrating on another one. Some powers may last for a short time after you cease concentrating. In such
              a case, the power keeps going for the given length of time after you stop concentrating, but no longer.
              Otherwise, you must concentrate to maintain the power, but you can’t maintain it for more than a stated
              지속시간 in any event. If a target 이동 out of 거리, the power reacts as if your 집중 had been
              broken.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Subjects, Effects, and 범위:</b><span>
              If the power affects creatures directly the result travels with the subjects for the power’s 지속시간. If
              the power creates an effect, the effect lasts for 지속시간. The effect might 이동 or remain still. Such an
              effect can be destroyed prior to when its 지속시간 ends. If the power affects an 범위 then the power stays
              with that 범위 for its 지속시간. Creatures become subject to the power when they enter the 범위 and are no
              longer subject to it when they leave.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Touch Powers and Holding 돌격:</b><span>
              In most cases, if you don’t discharge a touch power on the round you manifest it, you can hold 돌격
              (postpone the discharge of the power) indefinitely. You can make touch 공격 round after round. If you
              touch anything with your hand while holding a 돌격, the power discharges. If you manifest another power,
              the touch power dissipates.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Some touch powersallow you to touch multiple targets as part of the power. You can’t hold 돌격 of such a
            power; you must touch all the targets of the power in the same round that you finish manifesting the power.
            You can touch one friend (or yourself) as a standard action or as many as six friends as a full round
            action.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Discharge: </b><span>Occasionally a power lasts for a set 지속시간 or until triggered or discharged.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>(D) Dismissible:</b><span>
              If 지속시간 line ends with “(D),” you can dismiss the power at will. You must be within 거리 of the
              power’s effect and must mentally will 차원 강제퇴거, which causes the same 표시 as when you first
              manifested the power. Dismissing a power is a standard action that does not provoke 기회 공격. A power
              that depends on 집중 is dismissible by its very nature, and dismissing it does not take an action or cause
              a 표시, since all you have to do to end the power is to stop concentrating on your turn.</span>

          <h3>내성 굴림</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">SAVING THROW</div>
          <p>
            Usually a harmful power allows a target to make a 내성 굴림 to avoid some or all of the effect. 내성 굴림
            line in a power 묘사 defines which type of 내성 굴림 the power allows and describes how 내성 굴림 against
            the power work.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Negates:</b><span> The power has no effect on a subject that makes a successful 내성 굴림.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Partial:</b><span>
              The power causes an effect on its subject, such as death. A successful 내성 굴림 means that some 하급
              effect occurs (such as being dealt 피해 rather than being killed).</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Half:</b><span> The power deals 피해, and a successful 내성 굴림 halves 피해 taken (round down). </span>
          </p>
          <p><b>None: </b><span>No 내성 굴림 is allowed.</span></p>
          <p>
            <b>(object):</b><span>
              The power can be manifested on objects, which receive 내성 굴림 only if they are psionic or if they are
              attended (held, worn, grasped, or the like) by a creature resisting the power, in which case the object
              uses the creature’s 내성 굴림 보너스 unless its own 보너스 is 상급. (This notation does not mean that a
              power can be manifested only on objects. Some powers of this sort can be manifested on creatures or
              objects.) A psionic item’s 내성 굴림 보너스 are each equal to 2 + one-half the item’s 구현자 레벨.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>(harmless):</b><span>
              The power is usually beneficial, not harmful, but a targeted creature can attempt a 내성 굴림 if it
              desires.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>내성 굴림 난이도 등급:</b><span>
              A 내성 굴림 against your power has a DC 10 + 레벨 of the power + your 핵심 능력 수정치 (지능 for a 사이언,
              지혜 for a 사이킥 군인, or 매력 for a 와일더). A power’s 레벨 can vary depending on your class. Always use
              the power 레벨 applicable to your class.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Succeeding on a 내성 굴림:</b><span>
              A creature that successfully 내성 굴림 against a power that has no obvious physical effects feels a
              hostile force or a tingle, but cannot deduce the exact nature of 공격. Likewise, if a creature’s 내성 굴림
              succeeds against a targeted power you sense that the power has failed. You do not sense when creatures
              succeed on 내성 굴림 against effect and 범위 powers.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Failing a 내성 굴림 against 정신영향계 Powers: </b><span>If you fail your save, you are unaware that you have been affected by a power.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Automatic Failures and Successes:</b><span>
              A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a 내성 굴림 is always a failure, and the power may deal 피해 to
              exposed items (see Items Surviving after a 내성 굴림, below). A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always
              a success.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Voluntarily Giving up a 내성 굴림:</b><span>
              A creature can voluntarily forego a 내성 굴림 and willingly accept a power’s result. Even a character with
              a special 저항 to 사이오닉 can suppress this quality.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Items Surviving after a 내성 굴림:</b><span>
              Unless 설명 문구 for the power specifies otherwise, all items carried or worn by a creature are assumed to
              survive a psionic 공격. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its 내성 굴림 against the effect, however, an
              exposed item is harmed (if 공격 can 해악 objects). Refer to 표: Items Affected by Psionic 공격.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Determine which four objects carried or worn by the creature are most likely to be affected and roll
            randomly among them. The randomly determined item must make a 내성 굴림 against 공격 form or take whatever
            피해 공격 deals.

          <div class="original-headline">POWER RESISTANCE</div>
          <p>
            파워 저항 is a special defensive ability. If your power is being resisted by a creature with 파워 저항, you
            must make a 구현자 레벨 check (d20 + 구현자 레벨) at least equal to the creature’s 파워 저항 for the power
            to affect that creature. The defender’s 파워 저항 functions like an 방어도 against psionic 공격. 주문 저항
            is equivalent to 파워 저항 unless 사이오닉 Is Different option is in use. Include any adjustments to your
            구현자 레벨 on this 구현자 레벨 check.
          </p>
          <p>
            파워 저항 line and 설명 문구 of a power 묘사 tell you whether 파워 저항 protects creatures from the power.
            In many cases, 파워 저항 applies only when a resistant creature is targeted by the power, not when a
            resistant creature encounters a power that is already in place.
          </p>
          <p>
            The terms “object” and “harmless” mean the same thing for 파워 저항 as they do for 내성 굴림. A creature
            with 파워 저항 must voluntarily lower 저항(a standard action) to be affected by a power noted as 해악 less.
            In such a case, you do not need to make 구현자 레벨 check described above.

            The psionic character class tables show how many 파워 포인트 a character has access to each day, depending
            on 레벨.

            A power’s cost is determined by its 레벨, as shown below. Every power’s cost is noted in its 묘사 for ease

            <b>Power Point Limit:</b><span>
              Some powers allow you to spend more than their base cost to achieve an improved effect, or augment the
              power. The maximum number of points you can spend on a power (for any reason) is equal to your 구현자
              레벨.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>XP Cost (XP):</b><span>
              On the same line that the power point cost of a power is indicated, the power’s 경험치 비용, if any, is
              noted. Particularly powerful effects entail an 경험치 비용 to you. No spell or power can restore XP lost
              in this manner. You cannot spend so much XP that you lose a 레벨, so you cannot manifest a power with an
              XP cost unless you have enough XP to spare. However, you can, on gaining enough XP to attain a new 레벨,
              use those XP for manifesting a power rather than keeping them and advancing a 레벨. The XP are expended
              when you manifest the power, whether or not the manifestation succeeds.</span>

          <div class="original-headline">DESCRIPTIVE TEXT</div>
          <p>
            This portion of a power 묘사 details what the power does and how it works. If one of the previous lines in
            묘사 included “see text,” this is where the explanation is found. If the power you’re reading about is based
            on another power you might have to refer to a different power for the “see text” information. If a power is
            the equivalent of a spell an entry of “see spell text” directs you to the appropriate spell 묘사<i>.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Augment:</b><span>
              Many powers have variable effects based on the number of 파워 포인트 you spend when you manifest them. The
              more points spent, the more powerful the manifestation. How this extra expenditure affects a power is
              specific to the power. Some augmentations allow you to increase the number of 피해 주사위, while others
              extend a power’s 지속시간 or modify a power in unique ways. Each power that can be augmented includes an
              entry giving how many 파워 포인트 it costs to augment and the effects of doing so. However, you can spend
              only a total number of points on a power equal to your 구현자 레벨.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Augmenting a power takes place as part of another action (manifesting a power). Unless otherwise noted in
            the Augment section of an individual power 묘사, you can augment a power only at the time you manifest it.
