License v1.0a.</p><section id="h1-0-psionic-powers-overview"><h1>사이오닉 파워 개요</h1><div class="original-headline">PSIONIC POWERS OVERVIEW</div><p>사이오닉 파워
spring from sentient minds. Even an undead creature or a being that has no
physical form can create a reserve of inner 근력 necessary to manifest
powers, as long as it has an 지능 score of at least 1. Vermin possessed
of a hive mind ability are an exception to this rule.</p><p>A psionic power
is a one-time psionic effect. Psionic characters and creatures need not prepare
their powers for use ahead of time. They either have sufficient 파워 포인트 to
manifest a power or they do not.</p><p>A power is
manifested when a psionic character pays its power point cost. Some 사이오닉 생명체 automatically manifest powers, called 유사사이오닉 능력, without
paying a power point cost. Other creatures pay 파워 포인트 to manifest their
powers, just as characters do.</p><p>Each power has
a specific effect. A power known to a psionic character can be used whenever he
or she has 파워 포인트 to pay for it.</p><section id="h3-1-manifesting-powers"><h3>파워 구현</h3><div class="original-headline">MANIFESTING POWERS</div><p>Psionic
characters and creatures manifest powers. Whether they cost 파워 포인트 when
manifest by a psionic character, or are manifested as 유사사이오닉 능력,
powers’ effects remain the same. The process of manifesting a power is akin to
casting a spell, but with significant differences.</p></section><section id="h3-2-choosing-a-power"><h3>파워 선택하기</h3><div class="original-headline">CHOOSING A POWER</div><p>First you must
choose which power to manifest. You can select any power you know, provided you
are capable of 파워 구현 of that 레벨 or higher. To manifest a power,
you must pay 파워 포인트, which count against your daily total. You can
manifest the same power multiple times if you have points left to pay for it.</p></section><section id="h3-3-concentration"><h3>집중</h3><div class="original-headline">CONCENTRATION</div><p>To manifest a
power, you must concentrate. If something threatens to interrupt your
집중 while you’re manifesting a power, you must succeed on a
집중 check or lose the 파워 포인트 without manifesting the power. The
more distracting the interruption and the higher the 레벨 of the power that
you are trying to manifest, the higher the DC. (Higher-레벨 powers require
more mental effort.)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Injury:</span><span> Getting hurt or being affected by hostile 사이오닉 while trying to
manifest a power can break your 집중 and 파멸 a power. If you take
피해 while trying to manifest a power, you must make a 집중 check
(DC 10 + points of 피해 taken + the 레벨 of the power you’re manifesting).
The interrupting event strikes during manifestation if it occurs between when
you start and when you complete manifesting a power (for a power with a
구현 시간 of 1 round or longer) or if it comes in response to your
manifesting the power (such as an 공격 of opportunity provoked by the
manifesting of the power or a contingent 공격 from a readied action).</span></p><p>If you are
taking continuous 피해 half the 피해 is considered to take place while you
are manifesting a power. You must make a 집중 check (DC 10 + 1/2 the
피해 that the continuous source last dealt + the 레벨 of the power you’re
manifesting).</p><p>If the last
피해 dealt was the last 피해 that the effect could deal then the 피해 is
over, and it does not 주의산만 you.</p><p>Repeated 피해
does not count as continuous 피해.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Power:</span><span> If you are affected by a power while attempting to manifest a power
of your own, you must make a 집중 check or lose the power you are
manifesting. If the power affecting you deals 피해, the 집중 DC is
10 + points of 피해 + the 레벨 of the power you’re manifesting. If the power
interferes with you or 주의산만 you in some other way, the 집중 DC is
the power’s save DC + the 레벨 of the power you’re manifesting. For a power
with no 내성 굴림, it’s the DC that the power’s 내성 굴림 would have if a
save were allowed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Grappling or
Pinned:</span><span> To manifest a power while grappling or
pinned, you must make a 집중 check (DC 20 + the 레벨 of the power
you’re manifesting) or lose the power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Vigorous
Motion: </span><span>If you are riding on a moving 탈것 소환, taking
a bouncy 탑승 in a wagon, on a small boat in rough water, belowdecks in a
storm-tossed ship, or simply being jostled in a similar fashion, you must make
a 집중 check (DC 10 + the 레벨 of the power you’re manifesting) or
lose the power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Violent
Motion: </span><span>If you are on a galloping 말, taking a
very rough 탑승 in a wagon, on a small boat in rapids or in a storm, on deck in
a storm-tossed ship, or being tossed roughly about in a similar fashion, you
must make a 집중 check (DC 15 + the 레벨 of the power you’re
manifesting) or lose the power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Violent
날씨: </span><span>If you are in a high wind carrying
blinding rain or sleet, the DC is 5 + the 레벨 of the power you’re
manifesting. If you are in wind-driven hail, dust, or debris, the DC is 10 +
the 레벨 of the power you’re manifesting. In either case, you lose the power
if you fail the 집중 check. If the 날씨 is caused by a power, use
the rules in the Power subsection above.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">파워 구현 on the Defensive:</span><span> If you want to manifest a
power without provoking 기회 공격, you need to 회피 and weave.
You must make a 집중 check (DC 15 + the 레벨 of the power you’re
manifesting) to succeed. You lose the 파워 포인트 without successful
manifestation if you fail.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Entangled:</span><span> If you want to manifest a power while entangled in a net or while
affected by a power with similar effects you must make a DC 15 집중
check to manifest the power. You lose the power if you fail.</span></p></section><section id="h3-4-manifester-level"><h3>구현자 레벨</h3><div class="original-headline">MANIFESTER LEVEL</div><p>The variables
of a power’s effect often depend on its 구현자 레벨, which is equal to
your psionic class 레벨. A power that can be augmented for additional effect
is also limited by your 구현자 레벨 (you can’t spend more 파워 포인트 on
a power than your 구현자 레벨). See Augment under 설명 문구, below.</p><p>You can
manifest a power at a lower 구현자 레벨 than normal, but the 구현자 레벨 must be high enough for you to manifest the power in question, and all
레벨-dependent features must be based on the same 구현자 레벨.</p><p>In the event
that a class feature or other special ability provides an adjustment to your
구현자 레벨, this adjustment applies not only to all effects based on
구현자 레벨 (such as 범위, 지속시간, and augmentation potential) but also
to your 구현자 레벨 check to overcome your target’s 파워 저항 and
to the 구현자 레벨 used in dispel checks (both the dispel check and the DC
of the check).</p></section><section id="h3-5-power-failure"><h3>파워 실패</h3><div class="original-headline">POWER FAILURE</div><p>If you try to
manifest a power in 상태이상 where the characteristics of the power (범위,
area, and so on) cannot be made to conform, the manifestation fails and the
파워 포인트 are wasted. </p><p>Powers also
fail if your 집중 is broken (see 집중, above).</p></section><section id="h3-6-the-power-s-result"><h3>파워의 결과</h3><div class="original-headline">THE POWER’S RESULT</div><p>Once you know
which creatures (or objects or areas) are affected, and whether those creatures
have made successful 내성 굴림 (if any were allowed), you can apply
whatever results a power entails.</p></section><section id="h3-7-special-power-effects"><h3>특수 파워 효과</h3><div class="original-headline">SPECIAL POWER EFFECTS</div><p>Certain special
features apply to all powers.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">공격:</span><span> Some powers refer to attacking. All offensive 전투 actions, even
those that don’t 피해 opponents, such as 무장해제 and 황소 쇄도, are considered
공격. All powers that opponents can resist with 내성 굴림, that deal
피해, or that otherwise 해악 or hamper subjects are considered 공격. <span style="font-style: italic;">영적 구조물 </span>and similar powers are not considered 공격 because the powers
themselves don’t 해악 anyone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Bonus Types:</span><span> Many powers give creatures bonuses to 능력 점수, 방어도,
공격, and other attributes. Each bonus has a type that indicates how the
power grants the bonus. The important aspect of bonus types is that two bonuses
of the same type don’t generally stack. With the exception of 회피 bonuses,
most circumstance bonuses, and racial bonuses, only the better bonus works (see
사이오닉과 마법 효과 조합하기, below). The same principle applies to
penalties—a character taking two or more penalties of the same type applies
only the worst one.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Bringing
Back the 죽음:</span><span> Of all the 사이오닉 파워, only <span style="font-style: italic;">현실 수정 </span>has the ability to restore slain characters to life. When a living
creature dies, its soul departs the body, leaves 물질 세계, travels
through 영적 세계, and goes to abide on the plane where the creature’s
deity resides. If the creature did not worship a deity, its soul departs to the
plane corresponding to its 성향. Bringing someone back from the 죽음 means
retrieving his or her soul and returning it to his or her body.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">레벨 손실: </span><span>The passage from life to death and back again is a wrenching journey
for a being’s soul. Consequently, any creature brought back to life usually
loses one 레벨 of experience. The character’s new experience point total is
midway between the minimum needed for his or her new (reduced) 레벨 and the minimum
needed for the next one. If the character was 1 레벨 at the time of death,
he or she loses 2 points of 건강 instead of losing a 레벨. This 레벨 손실 or 건강 loss cannot be repaired by any mortal means, even the
주문 <span style="font-style: italic;">소원 </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">기적</span>. A revived character can regain a lost
레벨 by earning XP through further adventuring. A revived character who was
1 레벨 at the time of death can regain lost points of 건강 by
improving his or her 건강 score when he or she attains a 레벨 that
allows an ability score increase.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Preventing
Revivif cation: </span><span>Enemies can take steps to make it
more difficult for a character to be returned from the 죽음. Keeping the body
prevents others from using a single manifestation of <span style="font-style: italic;">현실 수정 </span>to
restore the slain character to life.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Revivif
cation Against One’s Will: </span><span>A soul cannot be
returned to life if it does not 소원 to be. A soul knows the 이름, 성향,
and patron deity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and may
refuse to return on that basis.</span></p></section><section id="h3-8-combining-psionic-and-magical-effects"><h3>사이오닉과 마법 효과 조합하기</h3><div class="original-headline">COMBINING PSIONIC AND MAGICAL EFFECTS</div><p>The default
rule for the interaction of 사이오닉 and magic is simple: Powers interact with
주문 and 주문 interact with powers in the same way a spell or normal
spell-like ability interacts with another spell or spell-like ability. This is
known as 사이오닉–magic transparency.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">사이오닉–Magic
Transparency:</span><span> Though not explicitly called out in
the 주문 설명 or 마법 아이템 설명<span style="font-style: italic;">, </span>주문, spell-like
능력, and 마법 아이템 that could potentially affect 사이오닉 do affect
사이오닉. </span></p><p>When the rule
about 사이오닉–magic transparency is in effect, it has the following
ramifications.</p><p>주문 저항 is effective against powers, using the same mechanics. Likewise,
파워 저항 is effective against 주문, using the same mechanics as 주문 저항. If a creature has one kind of 저항, it is assumed to have the
other. (The effects have similar ends despite having been brought about by
different means.)</p><p>All 주문 that
마법 무효화 have equal effect against powers of the same 레벨 using the same
mechanics, and vice versa.</p><p>The spell <span style="font-style: italic;">마법 감지 </span>detects powers, their number, and their 근력 and location within
3 rounds (though a 사이크래프트 check is necessary to 식별 the 분야 of
the psionic aura).</p><p>죽음 magic
areas are also 죽음 사이오닉 areas.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Multiple
Effects:</span><span> Powers or psionic effects usually work as
described no matter how many other powers, psionic effects, 주문, or magical
effects happen to be operating in the same area or on the same recipient.
Except in special cases, a power does not affect the way another power or spell
operates. Whenever a power has a specific effect on other powers or 주문, the
power 묘사 explains the effect (and vice versa for 주문 that affect
powers). Several other general rules apply when powers, 주문, magical
effects, or psionic effects operate in the same place.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Stacking
Effects:</span><span> Powers that provide bonuses or penalties
on 명중 굴림, 피해 rolls, 내성 굴림, and other attributes usually do
not stack with themselves. More generally, two bonuses of the same type don’t
stack even if they come from different powers, or one from a power and one from
a spell. You use whichever bonus gives you the better result. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Different
Bonus Types</span><span>: The bonuses or penalties from two
different powers, or a power and a spell, stack if the effects are of different
types. A bonus that isn’t named (just a “+2 bonus” rather than a “+2 insight
bonus”) stacks with any bonus.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Same Effect
More than Once in Different 근력</span><span>: In cases
when two or more similar or identical effects are operating in the same area or
on the same target, but at different 근력, only the best one applies. If
one power or spell is dispelled or its 지속시간 달리기 out, the other power or
spell remains in effect (assuming its 지속시간 has not yet expired).</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Same Effect
with Differing Results</span><span>: The same power or spell can
sometimes produce varying effects if applied to the same recipient more than
once. The last effect in a series trumps the others. None of the previous
주문 or powers are actually removed or dispelled, but their effects become
irrelevant while the final spell or power in the series lasts.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">One Effect
Makes Another Irrelevant: </span><span>Sometimes, a power can
render another power irrelevant.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Multiple
Mental Control Effects</span><span>: Sometimes psionic or
magical effects that establish mental control render one another irrelevant.
Mental controls that don’t remove the recipient’s ability to act usually do not
interfere with one another, though one may modify another. If a creature is
under the control of two or more creatures, it tends to obey each to the best
of its ability, and to the extent of the control each effect allows. If the
controlled creature receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the competing
controllers must make opposed 매력 checks to determine which one the
creature obeys.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Powers and
주문 with Opposite Effects:</span><span> Powers and 주문
with opposite effects apply normally, with all bonuses, penalties, or changes
accruing in the order that they apply. Some powers and 주문 negate or counter
each other. This is a special effect that is noted in a power’s or spell’s
묘사.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Instantaneous
Effects:</span><span> Two or more magical or psionic effects
with instantaneous 지속시간 work cumulatively when they affect the same
object, place, or creature. </span></p></section><section id="h2-9-powers-and-power-points"><h2>파워와 파워 포인트</h2><div class="original-headline">POWERS AND POWER POINTS</div><p>Psionic
characters manifest powers, which involve the direct manipulation of personal
mental energy. These manipulations require natural talent and personal
meditation. A psionic character’s 레벨 limits the number of 파워 포인트
available to manifest powers. A psionic character’s relevant high score might
allow him to gain extra 파워 포인트. He can manifest the same power more than
once, but each manifestation subtracts 파워 포인트 from his daily limit.
Manifesting a power is an arduous mental task. To do so, a psionic character
must have a key ability score of at least 10 + the power’s 레벨.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Daily Power
Point Acquisition:</span><span> To regain used daily 파워 포인트, a psionic character must have a clear mind. To clear his mind, he must
first 수면 for 8 hours. The character does not have to slumber for every
minute of the time, but he must refrain from 이동, 전투, 파워 구현,
skill use, conversation, or any other demanding physical or mental task during
the rest period. If his rest is interrupted, each interruption adds 1 hour to
the total amount of time he has to rest to clear his mind, and he must have at
least 1 hour of rest immediately prior to regaining lost 파워 포인트. If the
character does not need to 수면 for some reason, he still must have 8 hours of
restful calm before regaining 파워 포인트.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Recent
Manifesting Limit/Rest Interruptions:</span><span> If a psionic
character has manifested powers recently, the drain on his resources reduces
his capacity to regain 파워 포인트. When he regains 파워 포인트 for the
coming day, all 파워 포인트 he has used within the last 8 hours count against
his daily limit.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Peaceful
환경: </span><span>To regain 파워 포인트, a psionic
character must have enough peace, quiet, and comfort to allow for proper
집중. The psionic character’s surroundings need not be luxurious, but
they must be free from overt distractions, such as 전투 raging nearby or

manifester can create a new power. The research involved requires access to a
retreat conducive to uninterrupted meditation. Research involves an expenditure
of 200 XP per week and takes one week per 레벨 of the power. At the end of
that time, the character makes a 사이크래프트 check (DC 10 + spell 레벨). If that
check succeeds, the character learns the new power if her research produced a
viable power. If the check fails, the character must go through the research
process again if she wants to keep trying.</p><section id="h5-11-manifest-an-unknown-power-from-another-s-powers-known"><h5>다른이의 모르는 파워 구현</h5><div class="original-headline">Manifest an Unknown Power from Another’s Powers Known</div><p>A psionic
character can attempt to manifest a power from a source other than his own
지식 (usually a power stone or another willing psionic character). To do
so, the character must first make contact (a process similar to addressing a
power stone, requiring a 사이크래프트 check against a DC of 15+ the 레벨 of the
power to be manifested). A psionic character can make contact with only a
willing psionic character or creature (unconscious creatures are considered
willing, but not psionic characters under the effects of other immobilizing
상태이상). Characters who can’t use 파워스톤 for any reason are also
banned from attempting to manifest powers from the 지식 of other psionic
characters. Mental contact requires 1 full round of physical contact, which can
provoke 기회 공격. Once contact is achieved, the character becomes
aware of all the powers stored in the power stone or all the powers the other
character knows up to the highest 레벨 of power the contactor knows himself. </p><p>Next, the
psionic character must choose one of the powers and make a second 사이크래프트
check (DC 15 + the power’s 레벨) to see if he understands it. If the power is
not on his class list, he automatically fails this check.</p><p>Upon
successfully making contact with another willing psionic character or creature
and learning what he can of one power in particular, the character can
immediately attempt to manifest that power even if he doesn’t know it (and
assuming he has 파워 포인트 left for the day). He can attempt to manifest the
power normally on his next turn, and he succeeds if he makes one additional
사이크래프트 check (DC 15 + the power’s 레벨). He retains the ability to manifest
the selected power for only 1 round. If he doesn’t manifest the power, fails
the 사이크래프트 check, or manifests a different power, he loses his chance to
manifest that power for the day.</p></section></section><section id="h3-12-using-stored-power-points"><h3>저장된 파워 포인트 사용하기</h3><div class="original-headline">USING STORED POWER POINTS</div><p>A variety of

action of manifesting the power. If the check is unsuccessful, the power
manifests normally with its 표시.</span></p><p>Even if a

vicinity of the power’s subject (manifester’s choice), eerily akin to many
deep-pitched voices. The sound grows in a second from hardly noticeable to as
loud as a 힘찬 함성 strident enough to be heard within 100 feet. At the
manifester’s option, the instantaneous sound can be so soft that it can be
heard only within 15 feet with a successful DC 10 듣기 check. Some powers
describe unique auditory 표시.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Material:</span><span> The subject or the area is briefly slicked with a translucent,
shimmering substance. The glistening substance evaporates after 1 round
regardless of the power’s 지속시간. Sophisticated 사이언 recognize the material
as ectoplasmic seepage from 영적 세계; this substance is completely
inert.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Mental:</span><span> A subtle chime 반지 once in the minds of creatures within 15 feet
of either the manifester or the subject (at the manifester’s option). At the
manifester’s option, the chime can ring continuously for the power’s 지속시간.
Some powers describe unique mental 표시. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Olfactory:</span><span> An odd but familiar odor brings to mind a brief mental flash of a
long-buried memory. The 냄새 is difficult to pin down, and no two individuals
ever describe it the same way. The odor originates from the manifester and
spreads to a distance of 20 feet, then fades in less than a second (or lasts
for the 지속시간, at the manifester’s option).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Visual: </span><span>The manifester’s eyes burn like points of silver fire while the
power remains in effect. A rainbow-flash of 빛 sweeps away from the
manifester to a distance of 5 feet and then dissipates, unless a unique visual
표시 is described. This is the case when the 표시 entry includes “see

Action: </span><span>A swift action consumes a very small amount

regardless of what other actions you take. You can take a swift action any time
you would normally be allowed to take a free action. Swift actions usually
involve 사이오닉 or the activation of 사이오닉 아이템; many characters
(especially those who don’t use 사이오닉) never have an opportunity to take a
swift action.</span></p><p>Manifesting a
quickened power is a swift action. In addition, manifesting any power with a

Action:</span><span> Much like a swift action, an immediate
action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a larger
expenditure of effort and energy than a free action. However, unlike a swift
action, an immediate action can be performed at any time—even if it’s not your
turn. Using an immediate action on your turn is the same as using a swift
action, and counts as your swift action for that turn. You cannot use another
immediate action or a swift action until after your next turn if you have used
an immediate action when it is not currently your turn (effectively, using an
immediate action before your turn is equivalent to using your swift action for
the coming turn). You also cannot use an immediate action if you are currently
flat-footed.</span></p></section><section id="h3-29-range"><h3>범위</h3><div class="original-headline">RANGE</div><p>A power’s 범위

until you finish manifesting the power.</span></p><p>If you manifest
a targeted power on the wrong type of target the power has no effect. If the
target of a power is yourself (the power 묘사 has a line that reads
“Target: You”), you do not receive a 내성 굴림 and 파워 저항 does not
apply. The 내성 굴림 and 파워 저항 lines are omitted from such
powers.</p><p>Some powers can
be manifested only on willing targets. Declaring yourself as a willing target
is something that can be done at any time (even if you’re flat-footed or it
isn’t your turn). Unconscious creatures are automatically considered willing,
but a character who is conscious but immobile or helpless (such as one who is
bound, cowering, grappling, paralyzed, pinned, or stunned) is not automatically
willing. The 내성 굴림 and 파워 저항 lines are usually omitted from
such powers, since only willing subjects can be targeted.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Effect:</span><span> Some powers, such as most 재귀창조 powers, create things
rather than affect things that are already present. Unless otherwise noted in
the power 묘사, you must designate the location where these things are
to appear, either by seeing it or defining it. 범위 determines how far away an
effect can appear, but if the effect is mobile, it can 이동 regardless of the
power’s 범위 once created.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ray: </span><span>Some effects are 광선. You aim a ray as if using a ranged weapon,
though typically you make a ranged touch 공격 rather than a normal ranged
공격. As with a ranged weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an invisible
creature and hope you hit something. You don’t have to see the creature you’re
trying to hit, as you do with a targeted power. Intervening creatures and
obstacles, however, can block your line of sight or provide 엄폐 for the
creature you’re aiming at.</span></p><p>If a ray power
has a 지속시간, it’s the 지속시간 of the effect that the ray causes, not the
length of time the ray itself persists.</p><p>If a ray power
deals 피해, you can score a critical hit just as if it were a weapon. A ray
power threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double 피해
on a successful critical hit.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Spread: </span><span>Some effectsspread out from a point of origin (which may be
a grid intersection, or may be the manifester) to a distance described in the
power. The effect can extend around corners and into areas that you can’t see.
Figure distance by actual distance traveled, taking into account turns the
effect may take. When determining distance for spread effects, count around
벽, not through them. As with 이동, do not trace diagonals across
corners. You must designate the point of origin for such an effect (unless the
effect is centered on you), but you need not have line of effect (see below) to
all portions of the effect.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">(S)
Shapeable: </span><span>If an Effect line ends with “(S)” you
can shape the power. A shaped effect can have no dimension smaller than 10
feet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Area:</span><span> Some powers affect an area. Sometimes a power 묘사 specifies
a specially defined area, but usually an area falls into one of the categories
defined below.</span></p><p>Regardless of
the shape of the area, you select the point where the power originates, but
otherwise you usually don’t control which creatures or objects the power
affects. The point of origin of a power that affects an area is always a grid
intersection. When determining whether a given creature is within the area of a
power, count out the distance from the point of origin in squares just as you
do when moving a character or when determining the 범위 for a ranged 공격.
The only difference is that instead of counting from the center of one square
to the center of the next, you count from intersection to intersection.</p><p>You can count
diagonally across a square, but every second diagonal counts as 2 squares of
distance. If the far edge of a square is within the power’s area, anything
within that square is within the power’s area. If the power’s area touches only
the near edge of a square, however, anything within that square is unaffected
by the power.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">폭발,
Emanation, or Spread: </span><span>Most powers that affect an
area function as a 폭발, an emanation, or a spread. In each case, you select
the power’s point of origin and measure its effect from that point. A 폭발
power affects whatever it catches in its area, even including creatures that
you can’t see. It can’t affect creatures with total 엄폐 from its point of origin
(in other words, its effects don’t extend around corners). The default shape
for a 폭발 effect is a sphere, but some 폭발 powers are specifically
described as cone-shaped.</span></p><p>A 폭발’s area
defines how far from the point of origin the power’s effect extends.</p><p>An emanation
power functions like a 폭발 power, except that the effect continues to radiate
from the point of origin for the 지속시간 of the power.</p><p>A spread power
spreads out like a 폭발 but can turn corners. You select the point of origin,
and the power spreads out a given distance in all directions. Figure the area
the power effect fills by taking into account any turns the effect takes.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Cone, Line,
or Sphere: </span><span>Most powers that affect an area have a
particular shape, such as a cone, line, or sphere. A cone-shaped power shoots
away from you in a quarter-circle in the direction you designate. It starts
from any corner of your square and widens out as it goes. Most cones are either
폭발 or emanations (see above), and thus won’t go around corners.</span></p><p>A line-shaped
power shoots away from you in a line in the direction you designate. It starts
from any corner of your square and extends to the limit of its 범위 or until
it strikes a barrier that blocks line of effect. A line-shaped power affects
all creatures in squares that the line passes through or touches.</p><p>A sphere-shaped
power expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical area. Spheres may be
폭발, emanations, or spreads.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Other: </span><span>A power can have a unique area, as defined in its 묘사.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Line of
Effect:</span><span> A line of effect is a straight, unblocked
path that indicates what a power can affect. A solid barrier cancels a line of
effect, but it is not blocked by 안개, 암흑, and other factors that limit
normal sight. You must have a clear line of effect to any target that you
manifest a power on or to any space in which you 소원 to create an effect. You
must have a clear line of effect to the point of origin of any power you
manifest.</span></p><p>A 폭발, cone,
or emanation power affects only an area, creatures, or objects to which it has
line of effect from its origin (a spherical 폭발’s center point, a cone-shaped
폭발’s starting point, or an emanation’s point of origin). An otherwise solid
barrier with a hole of at least 1 square foot through it does not block a
power’s line of effect. Such an opening means that the 5-foot length of wall
containing the hole is no longer considered a barrier for the 목적 of
determining a power’s line of effect.</p></section><section id="h3-31-duration"><h3>지속시간</h3><div class="original-headline">DURATION</div><p>A power’s
지속시간 line tells you how long the psionic energy of the power lasts.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Timed
지속시간:</span><span> Many 지속시간 are measured in rounds,
minutes, hours, or some other increment. When the time is up, the psionic
energy sustaining the effect fades, and the power ends. If a power’s 지속시간
is variable it is rolled secretly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Instantaneous:
</span><span>The psionic energy comes and goes the instant the
power is manifested, though the consequences might be long-lasting.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Permanent: </span><span>The energy remains as long as the effect does. This means the power
is vulnerable to <span style="font-style: italic;">사이오닉 무효화</span>.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">집중:</span><span> The power lasts as long as you concentrate on it. Concentrating to
maintain a power is a standard action that does not provoke 기회 공격. Anything that could break your 집중 when manifesting a
power can also break your 집중 while you’re maintaining one, causing
the power to end. You can’t manifest a power while concentrating on another
one. Some powers may last for a short time after you cease concentrating. In
such a case, the power keeps going for the given length of time after you stop
concentrating, but no longer. Otherwise, you must concentrate to maintain the
power, but you can’t maintain it for more than a stated 지속시간 in any event.
If a target 이동 out of 범위, the power reacts as if your 집중 had
been broken.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Subjects,
Effects, and Areas:</span><span> If the power affects creatures
directly the result travels with the subjects for the power’s 지속시간. If the
power creates an effect, the effect lasts for the 지속시간. The effect might
이동 or remain still. Such an effect can be destroyed prior to when its
지속시간 ends. If the power affects an area then the power stays with that area
for its 지속시간. Creatures become subject to the power when they enter the
area and are no longer subject to it when they leave.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Touch Powers
and Holding the 돌격:</span><span> In most cases, if you don’t
discharge a touch power on the round you manifest it, you can hold the 돌격
(postpone the discharge of the power) indefinitely. You can make touch 공격
round after round. If you touch anything with your hand while holding a 돌격,
the power discharges. If you manifest another power, the touch power
dissipates.</span></p><p>Some touch
powersallow you to touch multiple targets as part of the power. You
can’t hold the 돌격 of such a power; you must touch all the targets of the
power in the same round that you finish manifesting the power. You can touch
one friend (or yourself) as a standard action or as many as six friends as a
full round action.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Discharge: </span><span>Occasionally a power lasts for a set 지속시간 or until triggered or
discharged.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">(D)
Dismissible:</span><span> If the 지속시간 line ends with “(D),”
you can dismiss the power at will. You must be within 범위 of the power’s
effect and must mentally will the 차원 강제퇴거, which causes the same 표시 as
when you first manifested the power. Dismissing a power is a standard action
that does not provoke 기회 공격. A power that depends on
집중 is dismissible by its very nature, and dismissing it does not
take an action or cause a 표시, since all you have to do to end the power is
to stop concentrating on your turn.</span></p></section><section id="h3-32-saving-throw"><h3>내성 굴림</h3><div class="original-headline">SAVING THROW</div><p>Usually a
harmful power allows a target to make a 내성 굴림 to avoid some or all of
the effect. The 내성 굴림 line in a power 묘사 defines which type of
내성 굴림 the power allows and describes how 내성 굴림 against the power
work.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Negates:</span><span> The power has no effect on a subject that makes a successful 내성 굴림.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Partial:</span><span> The power causes an effect on its subject, such as death. A
successful 내성 굴림 means that some 하급 effect occurs (such as being
dealt 피해 rather than being killed).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Half:</span><span> The power deals 피해, and a successful 내성 굴림 halves the
피해 taken (round down). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">None: </span><span>No 내성 굴림 is allowed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">(object):</span><span> The power can be manifested on objects, which receive 내성 굴림
only if they are psionic or if they are attended (held, worn, grasped, or the
like) by a creature resisting the power, in which case the object uses the
creature’s 내성 굴림 bonus unless its own bonus is 상급. (This notation
does not mean that a power can be manifested only on objects. Some powers of
this sort can be manifested on creatures or objects.) A psionic item’s 내성 굴림 bonuses are each equal to 2 + one-half the item’s 구현자 레벨.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">(harmless):</span><span> The power is usually beneficial, not harmful, but a targeted
creature can attempt a 내성 굴림 if it desires.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">내성 굴림
난이도 등급:</span><span> A 내성 굴림 against your power
has a DC 10 + the 레벨 of the power + your key ability modifier (지능
for a 사이언, 지혜 for a 사이킥 군인, or 매력 for a 와일더). A power’s
레벨 can vary depending on your class. Always use the power 레벨 applicable
to your class.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Succeeding
on a 내성 굴림:</span><span> A creature that successfully
내성 굴림 against a power that has no obvious physical effects feels a hostile
force or a tingle, but cannot deduce the exact nature of the 공격. Likewise,
if a creature’s 내성 굴림 succeeds against a targeted power you sense that
the power has failed. You do not sense when creatures succeed on 내성 굴림 against
effect and area powers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Failing a
내성 굴림 against Mind-Affecting Powers: </span><span>If you
fail your save, you are unaware that you have been affected by a power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Automatic
Failures and Successes:</span><span> A natural 1 (the d20 comes
up 1) on a 내성 굴림 is always a failure, and the power may deal 피해 to
exposed items (see Items Surviving after a 내성 굴림, below). A natural 20
(the d20 comes up 20) is always a success.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Voluntarily
Giving up a 내성 굴림:</span><span> A creature can
voluntarily forego a 내성 굴림 and willingly accept a power’s result. Even a
character with a special 저항 to 사이오닉 can suppress this quality.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Items
Surviving after a 내성 굴림:</span><span> Unless the
설명 문구 for the power specifies otherwise, all items carried or worn
by a creature are assumed to survive a psionic 공격. If a creature rolls a
natural 1 on its 내성 굴림 against the effect, however, an exposed item is
harmed (if the 공격 can 해악 objects). Refer to Table: Items Affected by
Psionic 공격.</span></p><p>Determine which
four objects carried or worn by the creature are most likely to be affected and
roll randomly among them. The randomly determined item must make a 내성 굴림
against the 공격 form or take whatever 피해 the 공격 deals.</p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 27.9751em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="break-inside: avoid; vertical-align: middle;"><td colspan="2" style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Table: Items Affected by Psionic 공격</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Order<span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 11.1111px; vertical-align: super;">1</span></td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Item</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">1st</td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">방패</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">2nd </td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">갑옷</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">3rd </td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">Psionic or
