Game Content, and is licensed for public use under the terms of the Open Game
License v1.0a.</p><section id="h1-0-psionic-powers-overview"><h1>사이오닉 파워 개요</h1><p>Psionic powers
spring from sentient minds. Even an undead creature or a being that has no
physical form can create a reserve of inner strength necessary to manifest
powers, as long as it has an Intelligence score of at least 1. Vermin possessed
of a hive mind ability are an exception to this rule.</p><p>A psionic power
is a one-time psionic effect. Psionic characters and creatures need not prepare
their powers for use ahead of time. They either have sufficient power points to
manifest a power or they do not.</p><p>A power is
manifested when a psionic character pays its power point cost. Some psionic
creatures automatically manifest powers, called psi-like abilities, without
paying a power point cost. Other creatures pay power points to manifest their
powers, just as characters do.</p><p>Each power has
a specific effect. A power known to a psionic character can be used whenever he
or she has power points to pay for it.</p><section id="h3-1-manifesting-powers"><h3>파워 구현</h3><p>Psionic
characters and creatures manifest powers. Whether they cost power points when
manifest by a psionic character, or are manifested as psi-like abilities,
powers’ effects remain the same. The process of manifesting a power is akin to
casting a spell, but with significant differences.</p></section><section id="h3-2-choosing-a-power"><h3>파워 선택하기</h3><p>First you must
choose which power to manifest. You can select any power you know, provided you
are capable of manifesting powers of that level or higher. To manifest a power,
you must pay power points, which count against your daily total. You can
manifest the same power multiple times if you have points left to pay for it.</p></section><section id="h3-3-concentration"><h3>집중</h3><p>To manifest a
power, you must concentrate. If something threatens to interrupt your
concentration while you’re manifesting a power, you must succeed on a
Concentration check or lose the power points without manifesting the power. The
more distracting the interruption and the higher the level of the power that
you are trying to manifest, the higher the DC. (Higher-level powers require
more mental effort.)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Injury:</span><span> Getting hurt or being affected by hostile psionics while trying to
manifest a power can break your concentration and ruin a power. If you take
damage while trying to manifest a power, you must make a Concentration check
(DC 10 + points of damage taken + the level of the power you’re manifesting).
The interrupting event strikes during manifestation if it occurs between when
you start and when you complete manifesting a power (for a power with a
manifesting time of 1 round or longer) or if it comes in response to your
manifesting the power (such as an attack of opportunity provoked by the
manifesting of the power or a contingent attack from a readied action).</span></p><p>If you are
taking continuous damage half the damage is considered to take place while you
are manifesting a power. You must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2 the
damage that the continuous source last dealt + the level of the power you’re
manifesting).</p><p>If the last
damage dealt was the last damage that the effect could deal then the damage is
over, and it does not distract you.</p><p>Repeated damage
does not count as continuous damage.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Power:</span><span> If you are affected by a power while attempting to manifest a power
of your own, you must make a Concentration check or lose the power you are
manifesting. If the power affecting you deals damage, the Concentration DC is
10 + points of damage + the level of the power you’re manifesting. If the power
interferes with you or distracts you in some other way, the Concentration DC is
the power’s save DC + the level of the power you’re manifesting. For a power
with no saving throw, it’s the DC that the power’s saving throw would have if a
save were allowed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Grappling or
Pinned:</span><span> To manifest a power while grappling or
pinned, you must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + the level of the power
you’re manifesting) or lose the power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Vigorous
Motion: </span><span>If you are riding on a moving mount, taking
a bouncy ride in a wagon, on a small boat in rough water, belowdecks in a
storm-tossed ship, or simply being jostled in a similar fashion, you must make
a Concentration check (DC 10 + the level of the power you’re manifesting) or
lose the power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Violent
Motion: </span><span>If you are on a galloping horse, taking a
very rough ride in a wagon, on a small boat in rapids or in a storm, on deck in
a storm-tossed ship, or being tossed roughly about in a similar fashion, you
must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the power you’re
manifesting) or lose the power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Violent
Weather: </span><span>If you are in a high wind carrying
blinding rain or sleet, the DC is 5 + the level of the power you’re
manifesting. If you are in wind-driven hail, dust, or debris, the DC is 10 +
the level of the power you’re manifesting. In either case, you lose the power
if you fail the Concentration check. If the weather is caused by a power, use
the rules in the Power subsection above.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Manifesting
Powers on the Defensive:</span><span> If you want to manifest a
power without provoking attacks of opportunity, you need to dodge and weave.
You must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the power you’re
manifesting) to succeed. You lose the power points without successful
manifestation if you fail.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Entangled:</span><span> If you want to manifest a power while entangled in a net or while
affected by a power with similar effects you must make a DC 15 Concentration
check to manifest the power. You lose the power if you fail.</span></p></section><section id="h3-4-manifester-level"><h3>구현자 레벨</h3><p>The variables
of a power’s effect often depend on its manifester level, which is equal to
your psionic class level. A power that can be augmented for additional effect
is also limited by your manifester level (you can’t spend more power points on
a power than your manifester level). See Augment under Descriptive Text, below.</p><p>You can
manifest a power at a lower manifester level than normal, but the manifester
level must be high enough for you to manifest the power in question, and all
level-dependent features must be based on the same manifester level.</p><p>In the event
that a class feature or other special ability provides an adjustment to your
manifester level, this adjustment applies not only to all effects based on
manifester level (such as range, duration, and augmentation potential) but also
to your manifester level check to overcome your target’s power resistance and
to the manifester level used in dispel checks (both the dispel check and the DC
of the check).</p></section><section id="h3-5-power-failure"><h3>파워 실패</h3><p>If you try to
manifest a power in conditions where the characteristics of the power (range,
area, and so on) cannot be made to conform, the manifestation fails and the
power points are wasted. </p><p>Powers also
fail if your concentration is broken (see Concentration, above).</p></section><section id="h3-6-the-power-s-result"><h3>파워의 결과</h3><p>Once you know
which creatures (or objects or areas) are affected, and whether those creatures
have made successful saving throws (if any were allowed), you can apply
whatever results a power entails.</p></section><section id="h3-7-special-power-effects"><h3>특수 파워 효과</h3><p>Certain special
features apply to all powers.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Attacks:</span><span> Some powers refer to attacking. All offensive combat actions, even
those that don’t damage opponents, such as disarm and bull rush, are considered
attacks. All powers that opponents can resist with saving throws, that deal
damage, or that otherwise harm or hamper subjects are considered attacks. <span style="font-style: italic;">Astral
construct </span>and similar powers are not considered attacks because the powers
themselves don’t harm anyone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Bonus Types:</span><span> Many powers give creatures bonuses to ability scores, Armor Class,
attacks, and other attributes. Each bonus has a type that indicates how the
power grants the bonus. The important aspect of bonus types is that two bonuses
of the same type don’t generally stack. With the exception of dodge bonuses,
most circumstance bonuses, and racial bonuses, only the better bonus works (see
Combining Psionic and Magical Effects, below). The same principle applies to
penalties—a character taking two or more penalties of the same type applies
only the worst one.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Bringing
Back the Dead:</span><span> Of all the psionic powers, only <span style="font-style: italic;">reality
revision </span>has the ability to restore slain characters to life. When a living
creature dies, its soul departs the body, leaves the Material Plane, travels
through the Astral Plane, and goes to abide on the plane where the creature’s
deity resides. If the creature did not worship a deity, its soul departs to the
plane corresponding to its alignment. Bringing someone back from the dead means
retrieving his or her soul and returning it to his or her body.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Level Loss: </span><span>The passage from life to death and back again is a wrenching journey
for a being’s soul. Consequently, any creature brought back to life usually
loses one level of experience. The character’s new experience point total is
midway between the minimum needed for his or her new (reduced) level and the minimum
needed for the next one. If the character was 1st level at the time of death,
he or she loses 2 points of Constitution instead of losing a level. This level
loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any mortal means, even the
spells <span style="font-style: italic;">wish </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">miracle</span>. A revived character can regain a lost
level by earning XP through further adventuring. A revived character who was
1st level at the time of death can regain lost points of Constitution by
improving his or her Constitution score when he or she attains a level that
allows an ability score increase.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Preventing
Revivif cation: </span><span>Enemies can take steps to make it
more difficult for a character to be returned from the dead. Keeping the body
prevents others from using a single manifestation of <span style="font-style: italic;">reality revision </span>to
restore the slain character to life.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Revivif
cation Against One’s Will: </span><span>A soul cannot be
returned to life if it does not wish to be. A soul knows the name, alignment,
and patron deity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and may
refuse to return on that basis.</span></p></section><section id="h3-8-combining-psionic-and-magical-effects"><h3>사이오닉과 마법 효과 조합하기</h3><p>The default
rule for the interaction of psionics and magic is simple: Powers interact with
spells and spells interact with powers in the same way a spell or normal
spell-like ability interacts with another spell or spell-like ability. This is
known as psionics–magic transparency.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Psionics–Magic
Transparency:</span><span> Though not explicitly called out in
the spell descriptions or magic item descriptions<span style="font-style: italic;">, </span>spells, spell-like
abilities, and magic items that could potentially affect psionics do affect
psionics. </span></p><p>When the rule
about psionics–magic transparency is in effect, it has the following
ramifications.</p><p>Spell
resistance is effective against powers, using the same mechanics. Likewise,
power resistance is effective against spells, using the same mechanics as spell
resistance. If a creature has one kind of resistance, it is assumed to have the
other. (The effects have similar ends despite having been brought about by
different means.)</p><p>All spells that
dispel magic have equal effect against powers of the same level using the same
mechanics, and vice versa.</p><p>The spell <span style="font-style: italic;">detect
magic </span>detects powers, their number, and their strength and location within
3 rounds (though a Psicraft check is necessary to identify the discipline of
the psionic aura).</p><p>Dead magic
areas are also dead psionics areas.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Multiple
Effects:</span><span> Powers or psionic effects usually work as
described no matter how many other powers, psionic effects, spells, or magical
effects happen to be operating in the same area or on the same recipient.
Except in special cases, a power does not affect the way another power or spell
operates. Whenever a power has a specific effect on other powers or spells, the
power description explains the effect (and vice versa for spells that affect
powers). Several other general rules apply when powers, spells, magical
effects, or psionic effects operate in the same place.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Stacking
Effects:</span><span> Powers that provide bonuses or penalties
on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and other attributes usually do
not stack with themselves. More generally, two bonuses of the same type don’t
stack even if they come from different powers, or one from a power and one from
a spell. You use whichever bonus gives you the better result. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Different
Bonus Types</span><span>: The bonuses or penalties from two
different powers, or a power and a spell, stack if the effects are of different
types. A bonus that isn’t named (just a “+2 bonus” rather than a “+2 insight
bonus”) stacks with any bonus.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Same Effect
More than Once in Different Strengths</span><span>: In cases
when two or more similar or identical effects are operating in the same area or
on the same target, but at different strengths, only the best one applies. If
one power or spell is dispelled or its duration runs out, the other power or
spell remains in effect (assuming its duration has not yet expired).</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Same Effect
with Differing Results</span><span>: The same power or spell can
sometimes produce varying effects if applied to the same recipient more than
once. The last effect in a series trumps the others. None of the previous
spells or powers are actually removed or dispelled, but their effects become
irrelevant while the final spell or power in the series lasts.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">One Effect
Makes Another Irrelevant: </span><span>Sometimes, a power can
render another power irrelevant.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Multiple
Mental Control Effects</span><span>: Sometimes psionic or
magical effects that establish mental control render one another irrelevant.
Mental controls that don’t remove the recipient’s ability to act usually do not
interfere with one another, though one may modify another. If a creature is
under the control of two or more creatures, it tends to obey each to the best
of its ability, and to the extent of the control each effect allows. If the
controlled creature receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the competing
controllers must make opposed Charisma checks to determine which one the
creature obeys.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Powers and
Spells with Opposite Effects:</span><span> Powers and spells
with opposite effects apply normally, with all bonuses, penalties, or changes
accruing in the order that they apply. Some powers and spells negate or counter
each other. This is a special effect that is noted in a power’s or spell’s
description.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Instantaneous
Effects:</span><span> Two or more magical or psionic effects
with instantaneous durations work cumulatively when they affect the same
object, place, or creature. </span></p></section><section id="h2-9-powers-and-power-points"><h2>파워와 파워 포인트</h2><p>Psionic
characters manifest powers, which involve the direct manipulation of personal
mental energy. These manipulations require natural talent and personal
meditation. A psionic character’s level limits the number of power points
available to manifest powers. A psionic character’s relevant high score might
allow him to gain extra power points. He can manifest the same power more than
once, but each manifestation subtracts power points from his daily limit.
Manifesting a power is an arduous mental task. To do so, a psionic character
must have a key ability score of at least 10 + the power’s level.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Daily Power
Point Acquisition:</span><span> To regain used daily power
points, a psionic character must have a clear mind. To clear his mind, he must
first sleep for 8 hours. The character does not have to slumber for every
minute of the time, but he must refrain from movement, combat, manifesting powers,
skill use, conversation, or any other demanding physical or mental task during
the rest period. If his rest is interrupted, each interruption adds 1 hour to
the total amount of time he has to rest to clear his mind, and he must have at
least 1 hour of rest immediately prior to regaining lost power points. If the
character does not need to sleep for some reason, he still must have 8 hours of
restful calm before regaining power points.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Recent
Manifesting Limit/Rest Interruptions:</span><span> If a psionic
character has manifested powers recently, the drain on his resources reduces
his capacity to regain power points. When he regains power points for the
coming day, all power points he has used within the last 8 hours count against
his daily limit.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Peaceful
Environment: </span><span>To regain power points, a psionic
character must have enough peace, quiet, and comfort to allow for proper
concentration. The psionic character’s surroundings need not be luxurious, but
they must be free from overt distractions, such as combat raging nearby or
other loud noises. Exposure to inclement weather prevents the necessary
concentration, as does any injury or failed saving throw the character might
incur while concentrating on regaining power points.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Regaining
Power Points:</span><span> Once the character has rested in a
suitable environment, it takes only an act of concentration spanning 1 full
round to regain all power points of the psionic character’s daily limit. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Death and
Power Points:</span><span> If a character dies, all daily power
points stored in his mind are wiped away. A potent effect (such as <span style="font-style: italic;">reality
revision</span>) can recover the lost power points when it recovers the character.</span></p><section id="h3-10-adding-powers"><h3>파워 추가하기</h3><p>Psionic
characters can learn new powers when they attain a new level. A psion can learn
any power from the psion/wilder list and powers from his chosen discipline’s
list. A wilder can learn any power from the psion/wilder list. A psychic
warrior can learn any power from the psychic warrior list. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Powers
Gained at a New Level: </span><span>Psions and other psionic
characters perform a certain amount of personal meditation between adventures
in an attempt to unlock latent mental abilities. Each time a psionic character
attains a new level, he or she learns additional powers according to his class
description. Psions, psychic warriors, and wilders learn new powers of their
choice in this fashion. These powers represent abilities unlocked from latency.
The powers must be of levels the characters can manifest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Independent
Research:</span><span> A psion also can research a power
independently, duplicating an existing power or creating an entirely new one.
If characters are allowed to develop new powers, use these guidelines to handle
the situation.</span></p><p>Any kind of
manifester can create a new power. The research involved requires access to a
retreat conducive to uninterrupted meditation. Research involves an expenditure
of 200 XP per week and takes one week per level of the power. At the end of
that time, the character makes a Psicraft check (DC 10 + spell level). If that
check succeeds, the character learns the new power if her research produced a
viable power. If the check fails, the character must go through the research
process again if she wants to keep trying.</p><section id="h5-11-manifest-an-unknown-power-from-another-s-powers-known"><h5>다른이의 모르는 파워 구현</h5><p>A psionic
character can attempt to manifest a power from a source other than his own
knowledge (usually a power stone or another willing psionic character). To do
so, the character must first make contact (a process similar to addressing a
power stone, requiring a Psicraft check against a DC of 15+ the level of the
power to be manifested). A psionic character can make contact with only a
willing psionic character or creature (unconscious creatures are considered
willing, but not psionic characters under the effects of other immobilizing
conditions). Characters who can’t use power stones for any reason are also
banned from attempting to manifest powers from the knowledge of other psionic
characters. Mental contact requires 1 full round of physical contact, which can
provoke attacks of opportunity. Once contact is achieved, the character becomes
aware of all the powers stored in the power stone or all the powers the other
character knows up to the highest level of power the contactor knows himself. </p><p>Next, the
psionic character must choose one of the powers and make a second Psicraft
check (DC 15 + the power’s level) to see if he understands it. If the power is
not on his class list, he automatically fails this check.</p><p>Upon
successfully making contact with another willing psionic character or creature
and learning what he can of one power in particular, the character can
immediately attempt to manifest that power even if he doesn’t know it (and
assuming he has power points left for the day). He can attempt to manifest the
power normally on his next turn, and he succeeds if he makes one additional
Psicraft check (DC 15 + the power’s level). He retains the ability to manifest
the selected power for only 1 round. If he doesn’t manifest the power, fails
the Psicraft check, or manifests a different power, he loses his chance to
manifest that power for the day.</p></section></section><section id="h3-12-using-stored-power-points"><h3>저장된 파워 포인트 사용하기</h3><p>A variety of
psionic items exist to store power points for later use, in particular a
storage device called a <span style="font-style: italic;">cognizance crystal</span>. Regardless of what sort of
item stores the power points, all psionic characters must follow strict rules
when tapping stored power points.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">A Single
Source: </span><span>When using power points from a storage item
to manifest a power, a psionic character may not pay the power’s cost with
power points from more than one source. He must either use an item, his own
power point reserve, or some other discrete power point source to pay the
manifestation cost. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Recharging: </span><span>Most power point storage devices allow psionic characters to
“recharge” the item with their own power points. Doing this depletes the
character’s power point reserve on a 1-for-1 basis as if he had manifested a
power; however, those power points remain indefinitely stored. The opposite is
not true—psionic characters may not use power points stored in a storage item
to replenish their own power point reserves.</span></p></section></section><section id="h2-13-special-abilities"><h2>특수 능력</h2><p>Psionic
creatures can create psionic effects without having levels in a psionic class
(although they can take a psionic class to further enhance their abilities);
such creatures have the psionic subtype.</p><p>Characters
using dorjes, <span style="font-style: italic;">cognizance crystals, </span>and other psionic items can also
create psionic effects. In addition to existing spell-like and supernatural
abilities, creatures can also have psi-like abilities. (Psionic creatures may
also have extraordinary and natural abilities.)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Psi-Like
Abilities (Ps):</span><span> The manifestation of powers by a
psionic character is considered a psi-like ability, as is the manifestation of
powers by creatures without a psionic class (creatures with the psionic
subtype, also simply called psionic creatures). Usually, a psionic creature’s
psi-like ability works just like the power of that name. A few psi-like
abilities are unique; these are explained in the text where they are described.</span></p><p>Psi-like
abilities have no verbal, somatic, or material components, nor do they require
a focus or have an XP cost (even if the equivalent power has an XP cost). The
user activates them mentally. Armor never affects a psi-like ability’s use. A
psi-like ability has a manifesting time of 1 standard action unless noted
otherwise in the ability description. In all other ways, a psi-like ability
functions just like a power. However, a psionic creature does not have to pay a
psi-like ability’s power point cost.</p><p>Psi-like
abilities are subject to power resistance and to being dispelled by <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel
psionics</span>. They do not function in areas where psionics is suppressed or
negated.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Supernatural
Abilities:</span><span> Some creatures have psionic abilities
that are considered supernatural. Psionic feats are also supernatural
abilities. These abilities cannot be disrupted in combat, as powers can be, and
do not provoke attacks of opportunity (except as noted in their descriptions).
Supernatural abilities are not subject to power resistance and cannot be
negated or dispelled; however, they do not function in areas where psionics is
suppressed<span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></span></p></section><section id="h2-14-psionic-maladies"><h2>사이오닉 질병</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Ability
Burn:</span><span> This is a special form of ability damage that
cannot be magically or psionically healed. It is caused by the use of certain
psionic feats and powers. It returns only through natural healing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Disease,
Cascade Flu:</span><span> Spread by brain moles and other
vermin; injury; DC 13; incubation one day; damage psionic cascade.</span></p><p>A psionic
cascade is a loss of control over psionic abilities. Using power points becomes
dangerous for a character infected by cascade flu, once the incubation period
has run its course. Every time an afflicted character manifests a power, she
must make a DC 16 Concentration check. On a failed check, a psionic cascade is
triggered. The power operates normally, but during the following round, without
the character’s volition, two additional powers she knows manifest randomly,
and their power cost is deducted from the character’s reserve. During the next
round, three additional powers manifest, and so on, until all the psionic
character’s power points are drained. Powers with a range of personal or touch
always affect the diseased character. For other powers that affect targets,
roll d%: On a 01–50 result, the power affects the diseased character, and 51–00
indicates that the power targets other creatures in the vicinity. Psionic
creatures (those that manifest their powers without paying points) cascade
until all the powers they know have manifested at least twice.</p><p>As with any
disease, a psionic character who is injured or attacked by a creature carrying
a disease or parasite, or who otherwise has contact with contaminated material,
must make an immediate Fortitude save. On a success, the disease fails to gain
a foothold. On a failure, the character takes damage (or incurs the specified
effect) after the incubation period. Once per day afterward, the afflicted
character must make a successful Fortitude save to avoid repeating the damage.
Two successful saving throws in a row indicate she has fought off the disease.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Disease,
Cerebral Parasites:</span><span> Spread by contact with infected
psionic creatures; contact; DC 15; incubation 1d4 days; damage 1d8 power
points. </span></p><p>Cerebral
parasites are tiny organisms, undetectable to normal sight. An afflicted
character may not even know he carries the parasites—until he discovers he has
fewer power points for the day than expected. Psionic creatures with cerebral
parasites are limited to using each of their known powers only once per day
(instead of freely manifesting them). See the note about diseases under Cascade
Flu, above.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Negative
Levels:</span><span> Psionic characters can gain negative levels
just like members of other character classes. A psionic character loses access
to one power per negative level from the highest level of power he can
manifest; he also loses a number of power points equal to the cost of that
power. If two or more powers fit these criteria, the manifester decides which
one becomes inaccessible. The lost power becomes available again as soon the
negative level is removed, providing the manifester is capable of using it at
that time. Lost power points also return.</span></p></section><section id="h2-15-power-descriptions"><h2>파워 설명</h2><p>The description
of each power is presented in a standard format. Each category of information
is explained and defined below.</p><section id="h3-16-name"><h3>이름</h3><p>The first line
of every power description gives the name by which the power is generally
known. A power might be known by other names in some locales, and specific
manifesters might have names of their own for their powers.</p></section><section id="h3-17-discipline-subdiscipline"><h3>분야 (하위분야)</h3><p>Beneath the
power name is a line giving the discipline (and the subdiscipline in
parentheses, if appropriate) that the power belongs to.</p><p>Every power is
associated with one of six disciplines. A discipline is a group of related
powers that work in similar ways. Each of the disciplines is discussed below.</p></section><section id="h3-18-clairsentience"><h3>초감각</h3><p>Clairsentience
powers enable you to learn secrets long forgotten, to glimpse the immediate
future and predict the far future, to find hidden objects, and to know what is
normally unknowable.</p><p>For the purpose
of psionics–magic transparency, clairsentience powers are equivalent to powers
of the divination school (thus, creatures immune to divination spells are also
immune to clairsentience powers).</p><p>Many
clairsentience powers have cone-shaped areas. These move with you and extend in
the direction you look. The cone defines the area that you can sweep each
round. If you study the same area for multiple rounds, you can often gain
additional information, as noted in the descriptive text for the power.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Scrying:</span><span> A power of the scrying subdiscipline creates an invisible sensor
that sends you information. Unless noted otherwise, the sensor has the same
powers of sensory acuity that you possess. This includes any powers or effects
that target you, but not powers or effects that emanate from you. However, the
sensor is treated as a separate, independent sensory organ of yours, and thus
functions normally even if you have been blinded, deafened, or otherwise
suffered sensory impairment. Any creature with an Intelligence score of 12 or
higher can notice the sensor by making a DC 20 Intelligence check. The sensor
can be dispelled as if it were an active power. Lead sheeting or psionic
protection blocks scrying powers, and you sense that the power is so blocked.</span></p></section><section id="h3-19-metacreativity"><h3>재귀창조</h3><p>Metacreativity
powers create objects, creatures, or some form of matter. Creatures you create
usually, but not always, obey your commands.</p><p>A
metacreativity power draws raw ectoplasm from the Astral Plane to create an
object or creature in the place the psionic character designates (subject to
the limits noted above). Objects created in this fashion are as solid and durable
as normal objects, despite their originally diaphanous substance. Psionic
creatures created with metacreativity powers are considered constructs, not
outsiders.</p><p>A creature or
object brought into being cannot appear inside another creature or object, nor
can it appear floating in an empty space. It must arrive in an open location on
a surface capable of supporting it. The creature or object must appear within
the power’s range, but it does not have to remain within the range.</p><p>For the purpose
of psionics–magic transparency, metacreativity powers are equivalent to powers
of the conjuration school (thus, creatures immune to conjuration spells are
also immune to metacreativity powers).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Creation:</span><span> A power of the creation subdiscipline creates an object or creature
in the place the manifester designates (subject to the limits noted above). If
the power has a duration other than instantaneous, psionic energy holds the
creation together, and when the power ends, the created creature or object
vanishes without a trace, except for a thin film of glistening ectoplasm that
quickly evaporates. If the power has an instantaneous duration, the created
object or creature is merely assembled through psionics. It lasts indefinitely
and does not depend on psionics for its existence.</span></p></section><section id="h3-20-psychokinesis"><h3>염동력</h3><p>Psychokinesis
powers manipulate energy or tap the power of the mind to produce a desired end.
Many of these powers produce spectacular effects above and beyond the power’s
standard display (see Display, below), such as moving, melting, transforming,
or blasting a target. Psychokinesis powers can deal large amounts of damage.</p><p>For the purpose
of psionics–magic transparency, psychokinesis powers are equivalent to powers
of the evocation school (thus, creatures immune to evocation spells are also
immune to psychokinesis powers).</p></section><section id="h3-21-psychometabolism"><h3>정신적대사작용</h3><p>Psychometabolism
powers change the physical properties of some creature, thing, or condition. </p><p>For the purpose
of psionics– magic transparency, psychometabolism powers are equivalent to
powers of the transmutation school (thus, creatures immune to transmutation
spells are also immune to psychometabolism powers).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Healing:</span><span> Psychometabolism powers of the healing subdiscipline can remove
damage from creatures. However, psionic healing usually falls short of divine
magical healing, in direct comparisons. </span></p></section><section id="h3-22-psychoportation"><h3>시공간초월</h3><p>Psychoportation
powers move the manifester, an object, or another creature through space and
time.</p><p>For the purpose
of psionics–magic transparency, psychoportation powers do not have an
equivalent school.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Teleportation:</span><span> A power of the teleportation subdiscipline transports one or more
creatures or objects a great distance. The most potent of these powers can
cross planar boundaries. Usually the transportation is one-way (unless
otherwise noted) and not dispellable. Teleportation is instantaneous travel
through the Astral Plane. Anything that blocks astral travel also blocks
teleportation.</span></p></section><section id="h3-23-telepathy"><h3>정신감응</h3><p>Telepathy
powers can spy on and affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling
their behavior.</p><p>Most telepathy
powers are mind-affecting.</p><p>For the purpose
of psionics–magic transparency, telepathy powers are equivalent to powers of
the enchantment school (thus, creatures resistant to enchantment spells are
equally resistant to telepathy powers).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Charm:</span><span> A power of the charm subdiscipline changes the way the subject
views you, typically making it see you as a good friend.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Compulsion:</span><span> A power of the compulsion subdiscipline forces the subject to act
in some manner or changes the way her mind works. Some compulsion powers
determine the subject’s actions or the effects on the subject, some allow you
to determine the subject’s actions when you manifest them, and others give you
ongoing control over the subject.</span></p></section><section id="h3-24-descriptor"><h3>[표지]</h3><p>Appearing on
the same line as the discipline and subdiscipline (when applicable) is a
descriptor that further categorizes the power in some way. Some powers have
more than one descriptor.</p><p>The descriptors
that apply to powers are acid, cold, death, electricity, evil, fire, force,
good, language-dependent, light, mind-affecting, and sonic.</p><p>Most of these
descriptors have no game effect by themselves, but they govern how the power
interacts with other powers, with spells, with special abilities, with unusual
creatures, with alignment, and so on.</p><p>A
language-dependent power uses intelligible language as a medium. </p><p>A
mind-affecting power works only against creatures with an Intelligence score of
1 or higher.</p></section><section id="h3-25-level"><h3>레벨</h3><p>The next line
of the power description gives a power’s level, a number between 1 and 9 that
defines the power’s relative strength. This number is preceded by the name of
the class whose members can manifest the power. If a power is part of a
discipline’s list instead of the psion’s general power list, this will be
indicated by the name of the discipline’s specialist. The specialists a power
can be associated with include Egoist (psychometabolism), Kineticist
(psychokinesis), Nomad (psychoportation), Seer (clairsentience), Shaper
(metacreativity), and Telepath (telepathy). </p></section><section id="h3-26-display"><h3>표시</h3><p>When a power is
manifested, a display may accompany the primary effect. This secondary effect
may be auditory, material, mental, olfactory, or visual. No power’s display is
significant enough to create consequences for the psionic creatures, allies, or
opponents during combat. The secondary effect for a power occurs only if the
power’s description indicates it. If multiple powers with similar displays are
in effect simultaneously, the displays do not necessary become more intense.
Instead, the overall display remains much the same, though with minute spikes
in intensity. A Psicraft check (DC 10 + 1 per additional power in use) reveals
the exact number of simultaneous powers in play.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Dispense
with Displays: </span><span>Despite the fact that almost every
power has a display, a psionic character can always choose to manifest the
power without the flashy accompaniment. To manifest a power without any display
(no matter how many displays it might have), a manifester must make a
Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the power). This check is part of the
action of manifesting the power. If the check is unsuccessful, the power
manifests normally with its display.</span></p><p>Even if a
manifester manifests a power without a display, he is still subject to attacks
of opportunity in appropriate circumstances. (Of course, another Concentration
check can be made as normal to either manifest defensively or maintain the
power if attacked.)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Auditory: </span><span>A bass-pitched hum issues from the manifester’s vicinity or in the
vicinity of the power’s subject (manifester’s choice), eerily akin to many
deep-pitched voices. The sound grows in a second from hardly noticeable to as
loud as a shout strident enough to be heard within 100 feet. At the
manifester’s option, the instantaneous sound can be so soft that it can be
heard only within 15 feet with a successful DC 10 Listen check. Some powers
describe unique auditory displays.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Material:</span><span> The subject or the area is briefly slicked with a translucent,
shimmering substance. The glistening substance evaporates after 1 round
regardless of the power’s duration. Sophisticated psions recognize the material
as ectoplasmic seepage from the Astral Plane; this substance is completely
inert.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Mental:</span><span> A subtle chime rings once in the minds of creatures within 15 feet
of either the manifester or the subject (at the manifester’s option). At the
manifester’s option, the chime can ring continuously for the power’s duration.
Some powers describe unique mental displays. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Olfactory:</span><span> An odd but familiar odor brings to mind a brief mental flash of a
long-buried memory. The scent is difficult to pin down, and no two individuals
ever describe it the same way. The odor originates from the manifester and
spreads to a distance of 20 feet, then fades in less than a second (or lasts
for the duration, at the manifester’s option).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Visual: </span><span>The manifester’s eyes burn like points of silver fire while the
power remains in effect. A rainbow-flash of light sweeps away from the
manifester to a distance of 5 feet and then dissipates, unless a unique visual
display is described. This is the case when the Display entry includes “see
text,” which means that a visual effect is described somewhere in the text of
the power. </span></p></section><section id="h3-27-manifesting-time"><h3>구현 시간</h3><p>Most powers
have a manifesing time of 1 standard action. Others take 1 round or more, while
a few require only a free action.</p><p>A power that
takes 1 round to manifest requires a full-round action. It comes into effect
just before the beginning of your turn in the round after you began manifesting
the power. You then act normally after the power is completed. </p><p>A power that
takes 1 minute to manifest comes into effect just before your turn 1 minute
later (and for each of those 10 rounds, you are manifesting a power as a
full-round action, as noted above for 1-round manifesting times). These actions
must be consecutive and uninterrupted, or the power points are lost and the
power fails.</p><p>When you use a
power that takes 1 round or longer to manifest, you must continue the
concentration from the current round to just before your turn in the next round
(at least). If you lose concentration before the manifesting time is complete,
the power points are lost and the power fails.</p><p>You make all
pertinent decisions about a power (range, target, area, effect, version, and so
forth) when the power comes into effect. </p></section><section id="h3-28-new-action-types"><h3>새로운 행동 유형</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Swift
Action: </span><span>A swift action consumes a very small amount
of time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy than a free
action. You can perform one swift action per turn without affecting your
ability to perform other actions. In that regard, a swift action is like a free
action. However, you can perform only a single swift action per turn,
regardless of what other actions you take. You can take a swift action any time
you would normally be allowed to take a free action. Swift actions usually
involve psionics or the activation of psionic items; many characters
(especially those who don’t use psionics) never have an opportunity to take a
swift action.</span></p><p>Manifesting a
quickened power is a swift action. In addition, manifesting any power with a
casting time of 1 swift action is a swift action.</p><p>Manifesting a
power with a manifesting time of 1 swift action does not provoke attacks of
opportunity. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Immediate
Action:</span><span> Much like a swift action, an immediate
action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a larger
expenditure of effort and energy than a free action. However, unlike a swift
action, an immediate action can be performed at any time—even if it’s not your
turn. Using an immediate action on your turn is the same as using a swift
action, and counts as your swift action for that turn. You cannot use another
immediate action or a swift action until after your next turn if you have used
an immediate action when it is not currently your turn (effectively, using an
immediate action before your turn is equivalent to using your swift action for
the coming turn). You also cannot use an immediate action if you are currently
flat-footed.</span></p></section><section id="h3-29-range"><h3>범위</h3><p>A power’s range
indicates how far from you it can reach, as defined in the Range entry of the
power description. A power’s range is the maximum distance from you that the
power’s effect can occur, as well as the maximum distance at which you can
designate the power’s point of origin. If any portion of the area would extend
beyond the range, that area is wasted. Standard ranges include the following.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Personal: </span><span>The power affects only you.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Touch:</span><span> You must touch a creature or object to affect it. A touch power
that deals damage can score a critical hit just as a weapon can. A touch power
threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a
successful critical hit. Some touch powersallow you to touch multiple
targets. You can touch as many willing targets as you can reach, but all
targets of the spell must be touched in the same round that you manifest the
power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Close: </span><span>The power reaches as far as 25 feet away from you. The maximum range
increases 5 feet for every two manifester levels you have.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Medium: </span><span>The power reaches as far as 100 feet + 10 feet per manifester level.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Long: </span><span>The power reaches as far as 400 feet + 40 feet per manifester level.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Range
Expressed in Feet:</span><span> Some powers have no standard
range category, just a range expressed in feet.</span></p></section><section id="h3-30-aiming-a-power"><h3>파워 조준</h3><p>You must make
some choice about whom the power is to affect or where the power’s effect is to
originate, depending on the type of power. The next entry in a power
description defines the power’s target (or targets), its effect, or its area,
as appropriate.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Target or
Targets: </span><span>Some powershave a target or
targets. You manifest these powers on creatures or objects, as defined by the
power itself. You must be able to see or touch the target, and you must
specifically choose that target. However, you do not have to select your target
until you finish manifesting the power.</span></p><p>If you manifest
a targeted power on the wrong type of target the power has no effect. If the
target of a power is yourself (the power description has a line that reads
“Target: You”), you do not receive a saving throw and power resistance does not
apply. The Saving Throw and Power Resistance lines are omitted from such
powers.</p><p>Some powers can
be manifested only on willing targets. Declaring yourself as a willing target
is something that can be done at any time (even if you’re flat-footed or it
isn’t your turn). Unconscious creatures are automatically considered willing,
but a character who is conscious but immobile or helpless (such as one who is
bound, cowering, grappling, paralyzed, pinned, or stunned) is not automatically
willing. The Saving Throw and Power Resistance lines are usually omitted from
such powers, since only willing subjects can be targeted.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Effect:</span><span> Some powers, such as most metacreativity powers, create things
rather than affect things that are already present. Unless otherwise noted in
the power description, you must designate the location where these things are
to appear, either by seeing it or defining it. Range determines how far away an
effect can appear, but if the effect is mobile, it can move regardless of the
power’s range once created.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ray: </span><span>Some effects are rays. You aim a ray as if using a ranged weapon,
though typically you make a ranged touch attack rather than a normal ranged
attack. As with a ranged weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an invisible
creature and hope you hit something. You don’t have to see the creature you’re
trying to hit, as you do with a targeted power. Intervening creatures and
obstacles, however, can block your line of sight or provide cover for the
creature you’re aiming at.</span></p><p>If a ray power
has a duration, it’s the duration of the effect that the ray causes, not the
length of time the ray itself persists.</p><p>If a ray power
deals damage, you can score a critical hit just as if it were a weapon. A ray
power threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage
on a successful critical hit.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Spread: </span><span>Some effectsspread out from a point of origin (which may be
a grid intersection, or may be the manifester) to a distance described in the
power. The effect can extend around corners and into areas that you can’t see.
Figure distance by actual distance traveled, taking into account turns the
effect may take. When determining distance for spread effects, count around
walls, not through them. As with movement, do not trace diagonals across
corners. You must designate the point of origin for such an effect (unless the
effect is centered on you), but you need not have line of effect (see below) to
all portions of the effect.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">(S)
Shapeable: </span><span>If an Effect line ends with “(S)” you
can shape the power. A shaped effect can have no dimension smaller than 10
feet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Area:</span><span> Some powers affect an area. Sometimes a power description specifies
a specially defined area, but usually an area falls into one of the categories
defined below.</span></p><p>Regardless of
the shape of the area, you select the point where the power originates, but
otherwise you usually don’t control which creatures or objects the power
affects. The point of origin of a power that affects an area is always a grid
intersection. When determining whether a given creature is within the area of a
power, count out the distance from the point of origin in squares just as you
do when moving a character or when determining the range for a ranged attack.
The only difference is that instead of counting from the center of one square
to the center of the next, you count from intersection to intersection.</p><p>You can count
diagonally across a square, but every second diagonal counts as 2 squares of
distance. If the far edge of a square is within the power’s area, anything
within that square is within the power’s area. If the power’s area touches only
the near edge of a square, however, anything within that square is unaffected
by the power.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Burst,
Emanation, or Spread: </span><span>Most powers that affect an
area function as a burst, an emanation, or a spread. In each case, you select
the power’s point of origin and measure its effect from that point. A burst
power affects whatever it catches in its area, even including creatures that
you can’t see. It can’t affect creatures with total cover from its point of origin
(in other words, its effects don’t extend around corners). The default shape
for a burst effect is a sphere, but some burst powers are specifically
described as cone-shaped.</span></p><p>A burst’s area
defines how far from the point of origin the power’s effect extends.</p><p>An emanation
power functions like a burst power, except that the effect continues to radiate
from the point of origin for the duration of the power.</p><p>A spread power
spreads out like a burst but can turn corners. You select the point of origin,
and the power spreads out a given distance in all directions. Figure the area
the power effect fills by taking into account any turns the effect takes.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Cone, Line,
or Sphere: </span><span>Most powers that affect an area have a
particular shape, such as a cone, line, or sphere. A cone-shaped power shoots
away from you in a quarter-circle in the direction you designate. It starts
from any corner of your square and widens out as it goes. Most cones are either
bursts or emanations (see above), and thus won’t go around corners.</span></p><p>A line-shaped
power shoots away from you in a line in the direction you designate. It starts
from any corner of your square and extends to the limit of its range or until
it strikes a barrier that blocks line of effect. A line-shaped power affects
all creatures in squares that the line passes through or touches.</p><p>A sphere-shaped
power expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical area. Spheres may be
bursts, emanations, or spreads.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Other: </span><span>A power can have a unique area, as defined in its description.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Line of
Effect:</span><span> A line of effect is a straight, unblocked
path that indicates what a power can affect. A solid barrier cancels a line of
effect, but it is not blocked by fog, darkness, and other factors that limit
normal sight. You must have a clear line of effect to any target that you
manifest a power on or to any space in which you wish to create an effect. You
must have a clear line of effect to the point of origin of any power you
manifest.</span></p><p>A burst, cone,
or emanation power affects only an area, creatures, or objects to which it has
line of effect from its origin (a spherical burst’s center point, a cone-shaped
burst’s starting point, or an emanation’s point of origin). An otherwise solid
barrier with a hole of at least 1 square foot through it does not block a
power’s line of effect. Such an opening means that the 5-foot length of wall
containing the hole is no longer considered a barrier for the purpose of
determining a power’s line of effect.</p></section><section id="h3-31-duration"><h3>지속시간</h3><p>A power’s
Duration line tells you how long the psionic energy of the power lasts.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Timed
Durations:</span><span> Many durations are measured in rounds,
minutes, hours, or some other increment. When the time is up, the psionic
energy sustaining the effect fades, and the power ends. If a power’s duration
is variable it is rolled secretly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Instantaneous:
</span><span>The psionic energy comes and goes the instant the
power is manifested, though the consequences might be long-lasting.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Permanent: </span><span>The energy remains as long as the effect does. This means the power
is vulnerable to <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel psionics</span>.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Concentration:</span><span> The power lasts as long as you concentrate on it. Concentrating to
maintain a power is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of
opportunity. Anything that could break your concentration when manifesting a
power can also break your concentration while you’re maintaining one, causing
the power to end. You can’t manifest a power while concentrating on another
one. Some powers may last for a short time after you cease concentrating. In
such a case, the power keeps going for the given length of time after you stop
concentrating, but no longer. Otherwise, you must concentrate to maintain the
power, but you can’t maintain it for more than a stated duration in any event.
If a target moves out of range, the power reacts as if your concentration had
been broken.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Subjects,
Effects, and Areas:</span><span> If the power affects creatures
directly the result travels with the subjects for the power’s duration. If the
power creates an effect, the effect lasts for the duration. The effect might
move or remain still. Such an effect can be destroyed prior to when its
duration ends. If the power affects an area then the power stays with that area
for its duration. Creatures become subject to the power when they enter the
area and are no longer subject to it when they leave.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Touch Powers
and Holding the Charge:</span><span> In most cases, if you don’t
discharge a touch power on the round you manifest it, you can hold the charge
(postpone the discharge of the power) indefinitely. You can make touch attacks
round after round. If you touch anything with your hand while holding a charge,
the power discharges. If you manifest another power, the touch power
dissipates.</span></p><p>Some touch
powersallow you to touch multiple targets as part of the power. You
can’t hold the charge of such a power; you must touch all the targets of the
power in the same round that you finish manifesting the power. You can touch
one friend (or yourself) as a standard action or as many as six friends as a
full round action.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Discharge: </span><span>Occasionally a power lasts for a set duration or until triggered or
discharged.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">(D)
Dismissible:</span><span> If the Duration line ends with “(D),”
you can dismiss the power at will. You must be within range of the power’s
effect and must mentally will the dismissal, which causes the same display as
when you first manifested the power. Dismissing a power is a standard action
that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A power that depends on
concentration is dismissible by its very nature, and dismissing it does not
take an action or cause a display, since all you have to do to end the power is
to stop concentrating on your turn.</span></p></section><section id="h3-32-saving-throw"><h3>내성 굴림</h3><p>Usually a
harmful power allows a target to make a saving throw to avoid some or all of
the effect. The Saving Throw line in a power description defines which type of
saving throw the power allows and describes how saving throws against the power
work.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Negates:</span><span> The power has no effect on a subject that makes a successful saving
throw.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Partial:</span><span> The power causes an effect on its subject, such as death. A
successful saving throw means that some lesser effect occurs (such as being
dealt damage rather than being killed).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Half:</span><span> The power deals damage, and a successful saving throw halves the
damage taken (round down). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">None: </span><span>No saving throw is allowed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">(object):</span><span> The power can be manifested on objects, which receive saving throws
only if they are psionic or if they are attended (held, worn, grasped, or the
like) by a creature resisting the power, in which case the object uses the
creature’s saving throw bonus unless its own bonus is greater. (This notation
does not mean that a power can be manifested only on objects. Some powers of
this sort can be manifested on creatures or objects.) A psionic item’s saving
throw bonuses are each equal to 2 + one-half the item’s manifester level.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">(harmless):</span><span> The power is usually beneficial, not harmful, but a targeted
creature can attempt a saving throw if it desires.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Saving Throw
Difficulty Class:</span><span> A saving throw against your power
has a DC 10 + the level of the power + your key ability modifier (Intelligence
for a psion, Wisdom for a psychic warrior, or Charisma for a wilder). A power’s
level can vary depending on your class. Always use the power level applicable
to your class.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Succeeding
on a Saving Throw:</span><span> A creature that successfully
saves against a power that has no obvious physical effects feels a hostile
force or a tingle, but cannot deduce the exact nature of the attack. Likewise,
if a creature’s saving throw succeeds against a targeted power you sense that
the power has failed. You do not sense when creatures succeed on saves against
effect and area powers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Failing a
Saving Throw against Mind-Affecting Powers: </span><span>If you
fail your save, you are unaware that you have been affected by a power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Automatic
Failures and Successes:</span><span> A natural 1 (the d20 comes
up 1) on a saving throw is always a failure, and the power may deal damage to
exposed items (see Items Surviving after a Saving Throw, below). A natural 20
(the d20 comes up 20) is always a success.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Voluntarily
Giving up a Saving Throw:</span><span> A creature can
voluntarily forego a saving throw and willingly accept a power’s result. Even a
character with a special resistance to psionics can suppress this quality.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Items
Surviving after a Saving Throw:</span><span> Unless the
descriptive text for the power specifies otherwise, all items carried or worn
by a creature are assumed to survive a psionic attack. If a creature rolls a
natural 1 on its saving throw against the effect, however, an exposed item is
harmed (if the attack can harm objects). Refer to Table: Items Affected by
Psionic Attacks.</span></p><p>Determine which
four objects carried or worn by the creature are most likely to be affected and
roll randomly among them. The randomly determined item must make a saving throw
against the attack form or take whatever damage the attack deals.</p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 27.9751em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="break-inside: avoid; vertical-align: middle;"><td colspan="2" style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Table: Items Affected by Psionic Attacks</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Order<span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 11.1111px; vertical-align: super;">1</span></td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Item</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">1st</td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">Shield</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">2nd </td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">Armor</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">3rd </td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">Psionic or

resistance is a special defensive ability. If your power is being resisted by a
creature with power resistance, you must make a manifester level check (d20 +
manifester level) at least equal to the creature’s power resistance for the
power to affect that creature. The defender’s power resistance functions like
an Armor Class against psionic attacks. Spell resistance is equivalent to power
resistance unless the Psionics Is Different option is in use. Include any
adjustments to your manifester level on this manifester level check.</p><p>The Power
Resistance line and the descriptive text of a power description tell you
whether power resistance protects creatures from the power. In many cases,
power resistance applies only when a resistant creature is targeted by the
power, not when a resistant creature encounters a power that is already in
place.</p><p>The terms
“object” and “harmless” mean the same thing for power resistance as they do for
saving throws. A creature with power resistance must voluntarily lower the resistance
(a standard action) to be affected by a power noted as harm less. In such a

you lose a level, so you cannot manifest a power with an XP cost unless you
have enough XP to spare. However, you can, on gaining enough XP to attain a new
