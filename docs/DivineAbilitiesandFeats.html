Game Content, and is licensed for public use under the terms of the Open Game License v1.0a.</p><section id="h1-0-salient-divine-abilities"><h1 title="SALIENT DIVINE ABILITIES">특화 신성 능력</h1><p>A salient divine ability is like a feat—it gives a deity a new capability or improves one that the deity already has. A deity has one salient divine ability for each divine rank the deity has, plus additional salient divine abilities reflecting its status: Demigods receive one bonus ability, lesser deities receive two bonus abilities, intermediate deities receive three, and greater deities receive five. </p><p>Some salient divine abilities have prerequisites. Usually, the deity must have all the listed prerequisites to have the ability. A divine rank of 1 is a prerequisite for all salient divine abilities. The most common salient divine abilities are described here. A few deities have unique salient divine abilities that are described in the deity’s individual entry.</p><p><strong title="Using Salient Divine Abilities:">특화 신성 능력 사용하기:</strong> Using a salient divine ability is a standard action unless otherwise noted in the ability description. Using a salient divine ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p><p><strong title="Salient Divine Abilities and Antimagic:">특화 신성 능력 및 항마:</strong> A salient divine ability functions normally within an antimagic field, and is never subject to spell resistance.</p><section id="h3-1-salient-divine-ability-descriptions"><h3 title="Salient Divine Ability Descriptions">특화 신성 능력 설명</h3><p>Here is the format for salient divine ability descriptions.</p></section><section id="h3-2-ability-name"><h3 title="Ability Name">능력 이름</h3><p><strong title="Prerequisite:">전제조건:</strong> A minimum divine rank, minimum ability score, another salient divine ability, a minimum base attack bonus, a feat, a skill, or some other condition that a deity must have in order to acquire this salient divine ability. This entry is absent if a salient divine ability has no prerequisite. An ability may have more than one prerequisite. All salient divine abilities have a minimum prerequisite of divine rank 1. Quasi-deities (rank 0) have no salient divine abilities.</p><p><strong title="Benefit:">이익:</strong> What the ability enables the deity to do. If a deity has the same ability more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description. In general, having a salient divine ability twice is the same as having it once.</p><p><strong title="Notes:">비고:</strong> Additional facts about the ability that may be helpful when using the ability in play.</p><p><strong title="Rest:">휴식:</strong> Some abilities require the deity to rest afterward. If no rest is required, the entry is absent. A resting deity can engage in light activities such as talking or walking at half speed. When attempting anything more strenuous than that, the deity can only take partial actions and suffers a –6 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. The deity cannot use another ability that requires rest until its current rest requirement is fulfilled. Any time the deity spends performing strenuous activities does not count toward the required rest time. </p><p><strong title="Suggested Portfolio Elements:">추천 포트폴리오 원소:</strong> This entry gives one or more portfolio elements that are associated with the salient divine ability in question. The information is provided as guidance and should not be taken as a rule.</p></section><section id="h3-3-alter-form"><h3 title="Alter Form">형태 변경</h3><p>This is an extraordinary ability.</p><p><strong title="Prerequisite:">전제조건:</strong> Alter Size salient divine ability.</p><p><strong title="Benefit:">이익:</strong> As a move-equivalent action, the deity can alter its form, including clothing and equipment. The assumed form must be corporeal. The deity’s body can undergo a limited physical transmutation, including adding or subtracting one or two limbs. If the form selected has wings, the deity can fly. Likewise, the deity can swim if the form has fins, breathe water if the form has gills, and so on.</p><p>The deity can remain in the altered form indefinitely, but resumes its own form if slain.</p><p><strong title="Notes:">비고:</strong> The deity’s attack bonus, Armor Class, and saves do not change. The deity does not gain any of the assumed form’s special abilities, attack forms, defenses, ability scores, or mannerisms. The deity can change physical qualities (such as hair color, hair</p><p>texture, skin color, and gender). The deity can use this ability to create disguises, gaining a bonus of +10 on its Disguise checks.

Such creatures suffer 1d6 points of</p><p>damage for each 10 feet they travel. Creatures that make successful saves are not affected by the vortex for one day, although the vortex still stops their thrown weapons and projectiles.

If the deity’s moral alignment is neutral (lawful neutral or chaotic neutral), the force does not damage any creatures. Affected creatures in the area must make Fortitude saves (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank) each round or suffer 1 point of holy damage per divine rank. A successful save negates the damage, but the creature must save again the next round if it is still within the area.</p><p>Creatures whose alignment is diametrically opposed to the deity’s are subject to both effects.</p><p><strong title="Suggested Portfolio Elements:">추천 포트폴리오 원소:</strong> War.</p></section><section id="h3-51-divine-water-mastery"><h3 title="Divine Water Mastery">신성 물 마스터</h3><p><strong title="Prerequisites:">전제조건:</strong> Water domain.</p><p><strong title="Benefit:">이익:</strong> The deity gains a competence bonus on attack, damage, and Armor Class equal to its divine rank if both the deity and its foe are touching the same body of water.</p><p>The deity gains a swim speed commensurate with its size (see Divine Characteristics).</p><p>At will, as a full-round action, the deity can create a devastating tidal wave of water.
