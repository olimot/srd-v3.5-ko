      <div class="original-headline">SALIENT DIVINE ABILITIES</div>
      <p>
        A salient 신성 ability is like a feat—it gives a deity a new capability or improves one that the deity already
        has. A deity has one salient 신성 ability for each 신성 rank the deity has, plus additional 특화 신성 능력
        reflecting its 상태확인: Demigods receive one 보너스 ability, 하급 deities receive two 보너스 능력, intermediate
        deities receive three, and 상급 deities receive five.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some 특화 신성 능력 have 전제조건. Usually, the deity must have all the listed 전제조건 to have the ability. A
        신성 rank of 1 is a prerequisite for all 특화 신성 능력. The most common 특화 신성 능력 are described here. A
        few deities have unique 특화 신성 능력 that are described in the deity의 individual entry.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Using 특화 신성 능력:</b><span>
          Using a salient 신성 ability is a standard action unless otherwise noted in the ability 묘사. Using a salient
          신성 ability does not provoke an 공격 of opportunity.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>특화 신성 능력 and 항마: </b><span>A salient 신성 ability functions normally within an 대마법 보호장, and is never subject to 주문 저항.</span>

            can engage in 빛 activities such as talking or walking at half 속도. When attempting anything more strenuous
            than that, the deity can only take partial actions and suffers a –6 페널티 on all 명중 굴림, 내성 굴림, and
            checks. The deity cannot use another ability that requires rest until its current rest requirement is
            fulfilled. Any time the deity spends performing strenuous activities does not count toward the required rest
            time.

            As a 이동-equivalent action, the deity can alter its form, including 의류 and 장비. The assumed form must be
            corporeal. The deity의 body can undergo a limited physical 변환술, including adding or subtracting one or
            two limbs. If the form selected has wings, the deity can 비행. Likewise, the deity can 수영 if the form has
            fins, breathe water if the form has gills, and so on.</span>

        <p>The deity can remain in the altered form indefinitely, but resumes its own form if slain.</p>

            The deity의 공격 보너스, 방어도, and 내성 굴림 do not change. The deity does not gain any of the assumed
            form의 특수 능력, 공격 forms, defenses, 능력 점수, or mannerisms. The deity can change physical qualities
            (such as hair color, hair</span>

          shorter, thinner, or heavier.

        <p>
          <b>이익:</b><span>
            This ability is similar to the <i>소원 </i>spell. The deity merely thinks
            of something and then makes it so. Doing this requires at least a standard action.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Notes:</b><span>
            The deity can duplicate any spell of 9th 레벨 or lower as a standard action. The duplicated spell has no
            material or XP component, and the DC of its 내성 굴림(if one is allowed) is 20 + the deity의 rank + the
            deity의 매력 수정치.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The deity also can duplicate a spell with any 메타마법 feat (so long as 메타마법 feat is available to
          characters of 20th 레벨 or lower). This use of the ability requires the deity to rest for 1 round for each
          레벨 that the feat would normally add to the spell. It still takes a standard action to use this ability, so
          there is no point in using the ability to duplicate a quickened spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deity can render a magical or supernatural effect permanent. The rest requirement varies with the effect:
          10 minutes per 레벨 of the effect times the number of subjects affected, 10 minutes per total 히트 다이스 of
          creatures affected, or 10 minutes per 10-foot cube affected. Use the highest applicable value.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deity can create temporary, nonmagical objects. This works like 물체 생성 ability (including the required
          rest period), except that the items last one day per rank.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deity also can create permanent nonmagical objects as if using 물체 생성 ability except that all rest
          필요조건 are doubled and there is no reduction in rest time for being on an Outer Plane or in the deity의 own
          realm.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deity can create temporary 마법 아이템 or creatures. This works like 신성 제작 ability (including the
          required rest period), except that the items or creatures created last 1 hour per rank. This ability cannot
          create permanent 마법 아이템 or creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deity can reshape a landscape, creating any type of terrain the deity can imagine. Each 10-foot cube of
          material to be reshaped requires 1 round of effort, and the deity must rest for one day per 10-foot cube
          shaped after the work is completed.

          <b>이익:</b><span>
            As a free action, the deity can assume any size from Fine to Colossal. The deity also can change the size of
            up to 100 pounds of objects it touches. If the deity has a familiar, personal 탈것 소환, or personal
            intelligent weapon, the creature can change size with the deity if the deity touches it, but its weight
            counts against the deity의 weight limit. This is a supernatural ability.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Notes:</b><span>
            This ability allows the deity to assume any proportions from the size of a grain of sand up or as much as
            1,600 feet tall. A radical change in size can have great impact on the deity의 전투 ability. The deity의
            근력, 방어도, 공격 보너스, and 피해 dealt with 무기 changes according to the size the deity assumes. The
            deity의 근력</span>

            When the deity strikes with a weapon or natural weapon, the opponent struck might be obliterated. Creatures,
            attended objects, and 마법 아이템 must make Fortitude 내성 굴림(DC 20 + the deity의 rank + 피해 dealt) or be
            reduced to –10 히트 포인트 and killed outright. Unattended, nonmagical objects are obliterated. The deity
            can destroy up to 1,000 cubic feet (a 10-foot cube) of nonliving matter per rank, so the ability destroys

            Except where noted here, this ability works like 신성 방패 ability. The deity produces a transparent barrier
            whose 범위 is up to one 10-foot square per rank, or a sphere or hemisphere with a radius of up to 1 foot per
            rank. The barrier can be placed anywhere within the deity의 line of sight. The deity can place the barrier
            so that it is mobile with respect to some unattended object or willing creature. The barrier can be adjusted
            to ignore certain types of 피해, just as a 신성 방패 can. If the deity makes 방패 mobile with respect to a
            willing creature, the deity also can make the barrier</span>

        <p>

            An 화신 serves as a deity의 alter ego, effectively allowing the deity to be in two or more places at the
            same time. An 화신 is an extension of a deity. The deity senses and knows everything 화신 senses and knows
            and vice versa. Each 화신 counts as a remote location where the deity is sensing and communicating. A 하급
            deity can have up to five 화신 at once, an intermediate deity can have up to ten, and a 상급 deity can have
            up to twenty 화신 at once. It takes a deity one year to create an 화신 or replace a destroyed 화신. The
            process does not require any special effort on the deity’s</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          part. An 화신 must be created in the deity의 own realm. If the deity has 신성 제작 salient 신성 ability, the
          deity can use it to create a new 화신 anywhere. However, the deity must rest afterward as noted in the 신성
          제작 ability 묘사. An 화신 is a less powerful version of a deity, created by modifying the deity의 statistics,
          that has the following characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>신성 Rank: </i><span>화신의 신성 rank is half that of the deity (round down). This decrease in 신성 rank affects many of the
            화신의 statistics and 능력, including 보너스 to 명중 굴림, 피해, 내성 굴림, checks, and 방어도, 피해 축소,
            저항, number of 특화 신성 능력 and 보너스 특화 신성 능력, uses per day of domain powers, 내성 굴림 DCs
            against 유사주문 능력, 거리 of senses, automatic actions, 마법 아이템 it can create, and extent of 신성
            aura. The deity의 능력 점수, 속도, 직업 레벨, and 히트 다이스 are unchanged.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>신성 능력: </i><span>화신 has 특화 신성 능력 according to its own 신성 rank. The deity chooses which of its 능력 화신 has when
            creating 화신. 화신 cannot have a salient 신성 ability that is not available to a deity of its own
            rank,</span>

          <b>이익:</b><span>
            The deity can make plants grow in a radius of up to one mile per 신성 rank once per day. The deity can use
            this ability even in a place where no plants grow, though in this case the plants wither and die after one
            day. This ability works like the <i>식물 성장 </i>spell, except that it

          Also once per day, the deity can charm plant creatures, 살아 움직이는 식물, or make them 휘감기 its foes. This
          ability functions like the <i>식물 명령 </i>spell, except that its maximum

            The deity can 명령 some kind of creature as noted in the deity의 묘사. This ability is similar to the
            <i>몬스터 지배 </i>spell, but it is not a 정신영향계 ability (the
            deity seizes direct control over the creature의 body). Each day the deity can attempt to control a number of
            creature equal to its 신성 rank. The deity can attempt to take control of that number all at once, or in
            smaller numbers. All creatures to</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          be affected must be within the deity의 line of sight when first affected. Once control is established,
          distance is not a factor and the deity can maintain control remotely, even across 이세계 and through wards or
          barriers (except 신성 방패 and warding 주문 cast by deities of higher rank than the deity using the ability).
          The subject is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + the deity의 rank + the deity의 매력 수정치) to resist and is

          At any given time, the deity cannot have more creatures under its control than 10 times its 신성 rank. If the
          deity already has the maximum number of creatures under its control, it can still attempt to take control of

        <p>
          • For the deity의 bardic 능력 that have a 거리(countersong,
          <i>fascinate, </i>inspire 적성, inspire greatness), that 거리 is a
          number of miles equal to the deity의 신성 rank.
        </p>
        <p>
          • The deity can use any bardic music inspiration ability as a standard action. The inspiration takes effect
          immediately after the deity concludes the action.
        </p>
        <p>
          • The deity의 bardic music 능력 can affect even those normally immune to 정신영향계 effects.
          However, such creatures gain a +10 보너스 on their Will 내성 굴림 to resist such effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          • The effects of all the deity의 bardic music 능력 are doubled. Inspire courage grants a +8 의욕 보너스 on
          내성 굴림 against charm and 공포 effects and a +8 의욕 보너스 on 공격 and 피해 rolls; inspire 적성
          grants a +4 적성 보너스 on 스킬 판정; inspire greatness grants +4d10 히트 다이스, a +4 적성 보너스
          on 명중 굴림, and a +2 적성 보너스 on Fortitude 내성 굴림, and inspire heroics grants a +8 의욕 보너스
          on 내성 굴림 and a +8 회피 보너스 to AC. The number of allies the deity can affect with inspire 적성,
          inspire greatness, and inspire heroics doubles. When inspiring 적성 in multiple allies, the deity can
          choose different 스킬 to inspire for different allies.
        </p>
        <p>
          • The effects of the deity의 bardic music inspiration 능력 last for ten times as long as normal after the
          deity stops singing. This has no effect on inspiration 능력 that have no 지속시간 after 음유시인 stops
          singing.
        </p>
        <p>
          • When any effect that is subject to countersong (any spell, supernatural ability, or 유사주문 effect that
          has the sonic or language-dependent desriptor) occurs within the deity의 hearing, the deity can attempt a
          countersong as if it had prepared an action to do so.

            The deity can cast 주문 whose effective 레벨 is above 9th. The number of 주문 per day the deity can cast of
            each spell 레벨 above 9th depends on the deity의 핵심 능력 score for spell-casting classes in which the

          If the deity has achieved 20th 레벨 in a spellcasting class with fewer than nine 레벨 of 주문(such as
          음유시인, 성기사, or 레인저), the deity can also cast one spell per day of each 레벨 between the maximum

            The deity can surround itself with a vortex of holy or unholy force that manifests in different forms
            depending on the deity. The vortex extends from the deity in an emanation with a radius of 10 feet per 신성
            rank. The effect stops 공격 with thrown 무기 and projectiles (they fail if made by creatures inside the
            범위, or targeted at creatures within 범위, or if their paths take them through 범위).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the force expels creatures whose 성향 on the ethical (lawful-chaotic) axis is opposite the
          deity’s. If the deity의 ethical 성향 is neutral (neutral good or neutral evil), the force does not expel any
          creatures. Affected creatures in 범위 must make Fortitude 내성 굴림(DC 10 + the deity의 매력 수정치 + the
          deity의 신성 rank) or be picked up and thrown out, regardless of size. Such creatures suffer 1d6 points of
        </p>
        <p>
          피해 for each 10 feet they travel. Creatures that make successful 내성 굴림 are not affected by the vortex for
          one day, although the vortex still stops their thrown 무기 and projectiles. Creatures that fail their 내성
          굴림 can attempt to reenter 범위, but must attempt new 내성 굴림.
        </p>
        <p>
          The force 피해 creatures whose 성향 on the moral (good-evil) axis is opposite the deity’s. If the deity의
          moral 성향 is neutral (lawful neutral or chaotic neutral), the force does not 피해 any creatures. Affected
          creatures in 범위 must make Fortitude 내성 굴림(DC 10 + the deity의 매력 수정치 + the deity의 신성 rank) each
          round or suffer 1 point of holy 피해 per 신성 rank. A successful save negates 피해, but the creature must save
          again the next round if it is still within 범위.
        </p>
        <p>Creatures whose 성향 is diametrically opposed to the deity의 are subject to both effects.</p>

        <p>
          At will, as a full-round action, the deity can create a devastating tidal wave of water. On land, the wave has
          effects similar to a flash flood: Creatures caught in the water must
        </p>
        <p>make a Fortitude save (DC 15). Large or smaller creatures that fail the save are swept</p>
        <p>away, taking 1d6 points of subdual 피해 per round (1d3 points on a successful</p>
        <p>
          수영 check against DC 20). Huge creatures that fail are knocked down, while Gar-gantuan and Colossal creatures
          are checked. The wave destroys all wooden buildings and
        </p>
        <p>
          25% of the stone buildings it comes into contact with. At sea, the tidal wave capsizes ships and crushes them
          to splinters. The wave affects a number of miles of coastland up to the deity의 신성 rank.

        <p>
          When touching water, the deity can automatically sense the location of anything within 10 feet per 신성 rank

        <p>
          <b>이익:</b><span>
            The deity points to any mortal within the deity의 sensory 거리 and snuffs out its life. There must be an
            unbroken line of effect between the deity and the target.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Notes:</b><span>
            This ability works like the <i>파괴 </i>spell, except that there is no
            material component. The mortal is allowed a Fortitude 내성 굴림 with a DC of 20 + the deity의 매력 보너스 +
            the deity의 신성 rank. Even if the save succeeds, the subject takes 10d6 points of 피해, which may kill it
            anyway. If 공격 kills the mortal (either through a failed 내성 굴림 or through 피해), the mortal cannot be
            raised or resurrected afterward, except by a deity of equal or higher rank using 생명의 선물, 삶과 죽음, or
            광역 삶과 죽음 salient 신성 ability.</span>

        <p><b>전제조건:</b><span> 공연 40 ranks.</span></p>
        <p>
          <b>이익:</b><span>
            When the deity sings, plays a musical instrument, tells jokes, recites verse, or engages in any other type
            of performance as a full-round action, the deity has the option to create any of the following effects. The
            deity can use this ability a number of times per</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          day equal to its 신성 rank. It affects up to one creature per 신성 rank within a 폭발 with a radius of 10 feet
          per 신성 rank, centered on the deity.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Affected creatures become unable to take actions; instead, they dance, observe the performance with rapt
          attention, laugh, or applaud at the deity의 option. The affected creatures also suffer a –4 페널티 to 방어도,
          cannot succeed at Reflex 내성 굴림(except on a roll of 20), and cannot use 방패. Creatures can resist this
          mind effect with a successful Will save (DC 10 + the deity의 매력 수정치 + the deity의 신성 rank). The effects
          last for as long as the deity 공연 and for up to 1 round per 신성 rank thereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Affected creatures become blissfully calm. They are immune to 공포 and 충동 effects except for those created
          by deities of higher rank than the performing deity and any such effects already operating on affected
          creatures are countered and dispelled. This ability also counters and dispels 격노 effects except for those
          created by deities of higher rank than the performing deity. Immunity to 공포 and 충동 last for as long as the
          deity 공연 and for up to 1 round per 신성 rank thereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Affected creatures fall asleep. This works like the <i>수면 </i>spell,
          except that any living creature can be affected. Creatures can resist this mind effect with Will 내성 굴림(DC
          10 + the deity의 매력 수정치 + the deity의 신성 rank). Affected creatures 수면 for up to 1 hour per 신성 rank
          or until awakened. The deity can end the effect at will.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Affected creatures are so deeply moved that they simply die. Only living creatures with 히트 다이스 equal to
          or less than the deity의 신성 rank are affected. Creatures can resist the effect with Fortitude 내성 굴림(DC
          10 + the deity의 매력 수정치 + the deity의 신성 rank).
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a creature makes a successful save against one of the deity의 performances, the creature cannot be
          affected again for one day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: Not all deities with this ability can create all the mentioned effects, as specified in the deity 묘사.

            unambiguously 식별 the subject in some fashion. If the deity chooses to kill a mortal, the ability works

            The deity can assume the form of another creature. The forms a deity can assume are limited and vary with
            each deity. The forms allowed are listed in the deity의 묘사. The deity can remain in the assumed form

        <p>resumes its own form if slain.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Notes:</b><span>
            The deity acquires the physical, natural, and extraordinary 능력 of the form it has assumed (but not
            유사주문 or supernatural 능력) while retaining its own mind. Physical 능력 include natural size and 근력,
            민첩, and 건강 scores. Natural 능력 include 갑옷, natural 무기(such as claws, bite, swoop and rake, and
            constriction; but not petrification, 브레스 무기, 정령 흡수, energy effect, and the like), and similar gross
            physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so on). A body with extra limbs
            does not allow the deity to make more 공격(or more advantageous two-weapon 공격) than normal. Natural 능력
            also include mundane 이동 capabilities, such as walking, swimming, and flight with wings. The deity의 속도
            is that of the assumed form or the deity의 normal 속도, whichever is higher.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, any part of the body or piece of 장비 that is separated from the whole reverts to its original
          form. However, if the assumed form has an extraordinary ability that allows it to produce a substance or shed
          part of its body, then this ability also grants that ability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deity retains its 지능, 지혜, and 매력 scores, 레벨 and class, 히트 포인트(despite any change in its 건강
          score), 성향, 기본 공격 보너스, and base 내성 굴림. (New 근력, 민첩, and 건강 scores may affect final 공격 and
          save 보너스.) The deity retains its outsider type, extraordinary 능력, 주문, and 유사주문 능력, but not its
          supernatural 능력.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deity also retains its 신성 방어도 보너스 and 신성 qualities and 능력, provided they are not supernatural.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deity can cast 주문 for which it has 구성요소. It needs a voice like that of a humanoid for verbal
          구성요소 and hands like those of a humanoid for somatic 구성요소, Likewise, the deity needs hands to use many
          of its powers, such as creating objects related to its portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the shape shift occurs, the deity의 장비, if any, transforms to match the new form. If the new form is a
          creature that does not use 장비(aberration, animal, beast, magical beast, construct, 드래곤, 정령, 늪괴물,
          some outsiders, plant, some undead creatures, some shapechangers, or vermin), 장비 melds into the new form and
          becomes nonfunctional.
        </p>
        <p>
          Material 구성요소 and focuses melded in this way cannot be used to cast 주문. If the new form uses 장비(fey,
          거인, humanoid, some outsiders, many shapechangers, many undead creatures), the deity의 장비 changes to match
          the new form and retains its properties.
        </p>
        <p>This ability cannot confer 직업 레벨 or class 능력.</p>
        <p>
          The deity can change physical qualities such as hair color, hair texture, skin color, and gender. The deity
          can use this ability to create 변장, gaining 보너스 of +15 on its 변장 checks.

              A repeated spell is automatically cast again at the beginning of your next round of actions. No matter
              where you are, the secondary spell originates from the same location and affects the same 범위 as the
              primary spell. If the repeated spell</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            designates a target, the secondary spell retargets the same target if the target is within 30 feet of its
            original position; otherwise the secondary spell fails to go off. A repeated spell uses up a spell slot
            three 레벨 higher than the spell의 actual 레벨. 주문 반복 cannot be used on 주문 with a 거리 of touch.
