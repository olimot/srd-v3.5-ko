A successful Autohypnosis check removes this movement penalty. The wound doesn’t go away—it is just ignored through self-persuasion.</p><p><em title="Memorize:">암기:</em> You can attempt to memorize a long string of numbers, a long passage of verse, or some other particularly difficult piece of information (but you can’t memorize magical writing or similarly exotic scripts). Each successful check allows you to memorize a single page of text (up to 800 words), numbers, diagrams, or sigils (even if you don’t recognize their meaning). If a document is longer than one page, you can make additional checks for each additional page. You always retain this information; however, you can recall it only with another successful Autohypnosis check.</p><p><em title="Resist Dying:">죽어가고 있음 상태 저항:</em> You can attempt to subconsciously prevent yourself from dying. If you have negative hit points and are losing hit points (at 1 per round, 1 per hour), you can substitute a DC 15 Autohypnosis check for your d% roll to see if you become stable. If the check is successful, you stop losing hit points (you do not gain any hit points, however, as a result of the check). You can substitute this check for the d% roll in later rounds if you are initially unsuccessful.</p><p><em title="Resist Fear:">공포 저항:</em> In response to any fear effect, you make a saving throw normally. If you fail the saving throw, you can make an Autohypnosis check on your next round even while overcome by fear. If your autohypnosis check meets or beats the DC for the fear effect, you shrug off the fear. On a failed check, the fear affects you normally, and you gain no further attempts to shrug off that particular fear effect.</p><p><em title="Tolerate Poison:">독 견디기:</em> You can choose to substitute an Autohypnosis check for a saving throw against any standard poison’s secondary damage or effect. This skill has no effect on the initial saving throw against poison.</p><p><em title="Willpower:">의지력:</em> If reduced to 0 hit points (disabled), you can make an Autohypnosis check. If successful, you can take a normal action while at 0 hit points without taking 1 point of damage. You must make a check for each strenuous action you want to take. A failed Autohypnosis check in this circumstance carries no direct penalty—you can choose not to take the strenuous action and thus avoid the hit point loss. If you do so anyway, you drop to –1 hit points, as normal when disabled.</p><p><strong title="Action:">행동:</strong> None. Making an Autohypnosis check doesn’t require an action; it is either a free action (when attempted reactively) or part of another action (when attempted actively).</p><p><strong title="Try Again:">다시 시도하기:</strong> Yes, for memorize and willpower uses, though a success doesn’t cancel the effects of a previous failure. No for the other uses.</p><p><strong title="Synergy:">시너지:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Autohypnosis, you get a +2 bonus on Knowledge (psionics) checks.</p><p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Concentration, you get a +2 bonus on Autohypnosis checks.</p></section><section id="h2-3-concentrationcon"><h2 title="CONCENTRATION(CON)">집중<small>(건)</small></h2><p>You are particularly good at focusing your mind. </p><p>The following are additional uses for the concentration skill.</p><p><strong title="Check:">판정:</strong> You must make a Concentration check whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by harsh weather, and so on) while engaged in some action that requires your full attention. Such actions include manifesting a power, concentrating on an active power, directing a power, or using a psi-like ability.</p><p>If the Concentration check succeeds, you can continue with the action as normal. If the check fails, the action automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of manifesting a power, the power points are lost. If you were concentrating on an active power, the power ends as if you had ceased concentrating on it. If you were directing a power, the direction fails but the power remains active. If you were using a psi-like ability, that use of the ability is lost.</p><p>The table below summarizes various types of distractions that cause you to make a Concentration check. If the distraction occurs while you are trying to manifest a power, you must add the level of the power you are trying to manifest to the appropriate Concentration DC.</p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><th style="min-width: 18.075em;" title="Concentration DC1">집중 DC<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></th><th style="min-width: 22.6501em;" title="Distraction">집중방해</th></tr><tr><td>10 + damage dealt</td><td>Damaged during the action.<sup style="font-weight: 700;">2</sup></td></tr><tr><td>10 + half of continuous damage last dealt</td><td>Taking continuous damage during the action.<sup style="font-weight: 700;">3</sup></td></tr><tr><td>15 + power level </td><td>Attempting to manifest a power without its display.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Entangled.</td></tr><tr><td>Distracting power’s save DC</td><td>Distracted by nondamaging power.<sup style="font-weight: 700;">4</sup></td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Gain psionic focus.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Grappling or pinned.

Psionic characters can put that energy to work without actually paying a power point cost—they can become psionically focused as a special use of the Concentration skill.</p><p>If you have 1 or more power points available, you can meditate to attempt to become psionically focused. The DC to become psionically focused is 20. Meditating is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. When you are psionically focused, you can expend your focus on any single Concentration check you make thereafter. When you expend your focus in this manner, your Concentration check is treated as if you rolled a 15. It’s like taking 10, except that the number you add to your Concentration modifier is 15. You can also expend your focus to gain the benefit of a psionic feat—many psionic feats are activated in this way.</p><p>Once you are psionically focused, you remain focused until you expend your focus, become unconscious, or go to sleep (or enter a meditative trance, in the case of elans), or until your power point reserve drops to 0.</p><p><strong title="Action:">행동:</strong> Usually none. In most cases, making a Concentration check doesn’t require an action; it is either a free action (when attempted reactively) or part of another action (when attempted actively). Meditating to gain psionic focus is a full-round action.</p><p><strong title="Try Again:">다시 시도하기:</strong> Yes, though a success doesn’t cancel the effects of a previous failure, such as the loss of the power points for a power being manifested or the disruption of a power being concentrated on.</p><p><strong title="Special:">특수:</strong> You can use Concentration to manifest a power or use a psi-like ability defensively, so as to avoid attacks of opportunity altogether. The DC of the check is 15 + the power’s level. If the Concentration check succeeds, you can manifest normally without provoking any attacks of opportunity. If the Concentration check fails, the power also automatically fails and the power points are wasted, just as if your concentration had been disrupted by a distraction.</p><p>A character with the Combat Manifestation feat gets a +4 bonus on Concentration checks made to manifest a power or use a psi-like ability while on the defensive or while grappling or pinned.</p><p><strong title="Synergy:">시너지:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Concentration, you get a +2 bonus on Autohypnosis checks.</p></section><section id="h2-4-knowledge-psionicsint"><h2 title="KNOWLEDGE (PSIONICS)(INT)">지식 (사이오닉)<small>(지)</small></h2><p>Like the Craft and Profession skills, Knowledge actually encompasses a number of unrelated skills.

You have to wave the item around or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a special +2 bonus if you’ve activated the item at least once before.</p><p>If you fail the check by 10 or more, you suffer brainburn. This brainburn affects you in the same way as brainburn that can occur when you attempt to manifest a power from a power stone, except that the damage is 1d4 points per power level instead of 1d6. Brainburn damage from activating blindly is in addition to brainburn damage from manifesting a power from a power stone.</p><p><em title="Address a Power Stone:">파워스톤 정체 밝히기:</em> Successfully addressing a power stone allows you to find out what power or powers it contains. Doing this requires 1 minute of concentration.</p><p><em title="Emulate an Ability Score:">능력 점수 모방하기:</em> To manifest a power from a power stone, you need a high ability score in the appropriate ability.
