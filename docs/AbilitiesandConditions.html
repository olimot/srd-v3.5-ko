        <h2>특수 능력</h2>
        <p>특수 능력 is either extraordinary, spell-like, or supernatural in nature.</p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Extraordinary Abilities (Ex):</span
          ><span>
            Extraordinary abilities are nonmagical. They are, however, not something that just anyone can do or even
            learn to do without extensive training. Effects or areas that negate or disrupt magic have no effect on
            extraordinary abilities.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell-Like Abilities (Sp):</span
          ><span>
            Spell-like abilities, as the name implies, are spells and magical abilities that are very much like spells.
            Spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance and
            <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel magic</span>. They do not function in areas where magic is
            suppressed or negated (such as an <span style="font-style: italic;">antimagic field</span>).</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Supernatural Abilities (Su):</span
          ><span>
            Supernatural abilities are magical but not spell-like. Supernatural abilities are not subject to spell
            resistance and do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated (such as an
            <span style="font-style: italic;">antimagic field</span>). A supernatural ability’s effect cannot be
            dispelled and is not subject to counterspells. See the table below for a summary of the types of 특수 능력.</span

          <h3>능력치 점수 손실</h3>
          <p>
            Various attacks cause 능력치 점수 손실, either ability damage or ability drain. Points lost to ability
            damage return at the rate of 1 point per day (or double that if the character gets complete bed rest) to
            each damaged ability, and the spells <span style="font-style: italic;">lesser restoration </span>and
            <span style="font-style: italic;">restoration </span>offset ability damage as well. Ability drain, however,
            is permanent, though <span style="font-style: italic;">restoration </span>can restore even those lost
            ability score points.
          </p>
          <p>While any loss is debilitating, losing all points in an ability score can be devastating.</p>
          <p>• Strength 0 means that the character cannot move at all. He lies helpless on the ground.</p>
          <p>• Dexterity 0 means that the character cannot move at all. He stands motionless, rigid, and helpless.</p>
          <p>• Constitution 0 means that the character is dead.</p>
          <p>
            • Intelligence 0 means that the character cannot think and is unconscious in a coma-like stupor, helpless.
          </p>
          <p>• Wisdom 0 means that the character is withdrawn into a deep sleep filled with nightmares, helpless.</p>
          <p>• Charisma 0 means that the character is withdrawn into a catatonic, coma-like stupor, helpless.</p>
          <p>
            Keeping track of negative ability score points is never necessary. A character’s ability score can’t drop
            below 0.
          </p>
          <p>Having a score of 0 in an ability is different from having no ability score whatsoever.</p>
          <p>
            Some spells or abilities impose an effective ability score reduction, which is different from 능력치 점수 손실. Any such reduction disappears at the end of the spell’s or ability’s duration, and the ability score
            immediately returns to its former value.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a character’s Constitution score drops, then he loses 1 체력 per Hit Die for every point by which his
            Constitution modifier drops. A 체력 score can’t be reduced by Constitution damage or drain to less than 1
            체력 per Hit Die.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ability that some creatures have to drain 능력치 점수 is a supernatural one, requiring some sort of
            attack. Such creatures do not drain abilities from enemies when the enemies strike them, even with unarmed
            attacks or natural weapons.

          <h3>항마</h3>
          <p>
            An <span style="font-style: italic;">antimagic field </span>spell or effect cancels magic altogether. An
            antimagic effect has the following powers and characteristics.
          </p>
          <p>
            • No supernatural ability, spell-like ability, or spell works in an area of antimagic (but extraordinary
            abilities still work).
          </p>
          <p>
            • Antimagic does not dispel magic; it suppresses it. Once a magical effect is no longer affected by the
            antimagic (the antimagic fades, the center of the effect moves away, and so on), the magic returns. Spells
            that still have part of their duration left begin functioning again, magic items are once again useful, and
            so forth.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Spell areas that include both an antimagic area and a normal area, but are not centered in the antimagic
            area, still function in the normal area. If the spell’s center is in the antimagic area, then the spell is
            suppressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Golems and other constructs, elementals, outsiders, and corporeal undead, still function in an antimagic
            area (though the antimagic area suppresses their spellcasting and their supernatural and spell-like
            abilities normally). If such creatures are summoned or conjured, however, see below.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Summoned or conjured creatures of any type, as well as incorporeal undead, wink out if they enter the area
            of an antimagic effect. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Magic items with continuous effectsdo not function in the area of an antimagic effect, but their effects
            are not canceled (so the contents of a <span style="font-style: italic;">bag of holding</span> are
            unavailable, but neither spill out nor disappear forever).
          </p>
          <p>• Two antimagic areas in the same place do not cancel each other out, nor do they stack.</p>
          <p>
            • <span style="font-style: italic;">Wall of force, prismatic wall, </span>and
            <span style="font-style: italic;">prismatic sphere </span>are not affected by antimagic.
            <span style="font-style: italic;">Break enchantment, dispel magic, </span>and
            <span style="font-style: italic;">greater dispel magic </span>spells do not dispel antimagic.
            <span style="font-style: italic;">Mage’s disjunction </span>has a 1% chance per caster level of destroying
            an <span style="font-style: italic;">antimagic field. </span>If the
            <span style="font-style: italic;">antimagic field </span>survives the
            <span style="font-style: italic;">disjunction, </span>no items within it are disjoined.

          <h3>시각 차단 및 감각 차단</h3>
          <p>
            Some creatures have blindsight, the extraordinary ability to use a nonvisual sense (or a combination of such
            senses) to operate effectively without vision. Such sense may include sensitivity to vibrations, acute
            scent, keen hearing, or echolocation. This ability makes 투명상태 and concealment (even magical
            darkness) irrelevant to the creature (though it still can’t see 무형의 creatures). This ability operates
            out to a range specified in the creature description.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Blindsight never allows a creature to distinguish color or visual contrast. A creature cannot read with
            blindsight.
          </p>
          <p>• Blindsight does not subject a creature to 시선 공격 (even though 암흑시야 does).</p>
          <p>• Blinding attacks do not penalize creatures using blindsight.</p>
          <p>• Deafening attacks thwart blindsight if it relies on hearing.</p>
          <p>• Blindsight works underwater but not in a vacuum.</p>
          <p>• Blindsight negates displacement and blur effects.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Blindsense:</span
            ><span>
              Other creatures have blindsense, a lesser ability that lets the creature notice things it cannot see, but
              without the precision of blindsight. The creature with blindsense usually does not need to make Spot or
              Listen checks to notice and locate creatures within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has
              line of effect to that creature. Any opponent the creature cannot see has total concealment (50% miss
              chance) against the creature with blindsense, and the blindsensing creature still has the normal miss
              chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with
              blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to 방어도 against attacks from
              creatures it cannot see.</span

          <h3>브레스 무기</h3>
          <p>
            A creature attacking with 브레스 무기 is actually expelling something from its mouth (rather than
            conjuring it by means of a spell or some other magical effect). Most creatures with 브레스 무기 are
            limited to a number of uses per day or by a minimum length of time that must pass between uses. Such
            creatures are usually smart enough to save their 브레스 무기 until they really need it.
          </p>
          <p>• Using 브레스 무기 is typically a standard action.</p>
          <p>• No 명중 굴림 is necessary. The breath simply fills its stated area.</p>
          <p>
            • Any character caught in the area must make the appropriate 내성 굴림 or suffer 브레스 무기’s full
            effect. In many cases, a character who succeeds on his 내성 굴림 still takes half damage or some other
            reduced effect.
          </p>
          <p>• 브레스 무기 are supernatural abilities except where noted.</p>
          <p>• Creatures are immune to their own 브레스 무기.</p>

          <h3>매혹과 명령</h3>
          <p>
            Many abilities and spells can cloud the minds of characters and monsters, leaving them unable to tell friend
            from foe—or worse yet, deceiving them into thinking that their former friends are now their worst enemies.
            Two general types of enchantments affect characters and creatures: charms and compulsions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Charming another creature gives the charming character the ability to befriend and suggest courses of
            actions to his minion, but the servitude is not absolute or mindless. Charms of this type include the
            various <span style="font-style: italic;">charm </span>spells. Essentially, a
            <span style="font-style: italic;">charmed </span>character retains free will but makes choices according to
            a skewed view of the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            • A <span style="font-style: italic;">charmed </span>creature doesn’t gain any magical ability to understand
            his new friend’s language.
          </p>
          <p>
            • A <span style="font-style: italic;">charmed </span>character retains his original alignment and
            allegiances, generally with the exception that he now regards the
            <span style="font-style: italic;">charming </span>creature as a dear friend and will give great weight to
            his suggestions and directions.
          </p>
          <p>
            • A <span style="font-style: italic;">charmed </span>character fights his former allies only if they
            threaten his new friend, and even then he uses the least lethal means at his disposal as long as these
            tactics show any possibility of success (just as he would in a fight between two actual friends).
          </p>
          <p>
            • A <span style="font-style: italic;">charmed </span>character is entitled to an opposed Charisma check
            against his master in order to resist instructions or commands that would make him do something he wouldn’t
            normally do even for a close friend. If he succeeds, he decides not to go along with that order but remains
            <span style="font-style: italic;">charmed.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            • A <span style="font-style: italic;">charmed </span>character never obeys a command that is obviously
            suicidal or grievously harmful to her.
          </p>
          <p>
            • If the charming creature commands his minion to do something that the influenced character would be
            violently opposed to, the subject may attempt a new 내성 굴림 to break free of the influence altogether.
          </p>
          <p>
            • A <span style="font-style: italic;">charmed </span>character who is openly attacked by the creature who
            <span style="font-style: italic;">charmed </span>him or by that creature’s apparent allies is automatically
            freed of the spell or effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compulsion is a different matter altogether. A compulsion overrides the subject’s free will in some way or
            simply changes the way the subject’s mind works. A charm makes the subject a friend of the caster; a
            compulsion makes the subject obey the caster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of whether a character is charmed or compelled, he won’t volunteer information or tactics that
            his master doesn’t ask for.

          <h3>냉기 내성</h3>
          <p>
            A creature with 냉기 내성 never takes cold damage. It has vulnerability to fire, which means it takes
            half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a 내성 굴림 is allowed, or if
            the save is a success or failure.

        <section id="h3-8-damage-reduction">
          <h3>피해 감소</h3>
          <p>
            Some magic creatures have the supernatural ability to instantly heal damage from weapons or to ignore blows
            altogether as though they were invulnerable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The numerical part of a creature’s damage reduction is the amount of 체력 the creature ignores from normal
            attacks. Usually, a certain type of weapon can overcome this reduction. This information is separated from
            the damage reduction number by a slash. Damage reduction may be overcome by special materials, by magic
            weapons (any weapon with a +1 or higher enhancement bonus, not counting the enhancement from masterwork
            quality), certain types of weapons (such as slashing or bludgeoning), and weapons imbued with an alignment.
            If a dash follows the slash then the damage reduction is effective against any attack that does not ignore
            damage reduction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is treated as a magic
            weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon
            with an alignment gains the alignment of that projectile weapon (in addition to any alignment it may already
            have).
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever damage reduction completely negates the damage from an attack, it also negates most special effects
            that accompany the attack, such as injury type poison, a monk’s stunning, and injury type disease. Damage
            reduction does not negate touch attacks, energy damage dealt along with an attack, or energy drains. Nor
            does it affect poisons or diseases delivered by inhalation, ingestion, or contact.
          </p>
          <p>Attacks that deal no damage because of the target’s damage reduction do not disrupt spells.</p>
          <p>Spells, spell-like abilities, and energy attacks (even nonmagical fire) ignore damage reduction.</p>
          <p>
            Sometimes damage reduction is instant healing. Sometimes damage reduction represents the creature’s tough
            hide or body,. In either case, characters can see that conventional attacks don’t work.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a creature has damage reduction from more than one source, the two forms of damage reduction do not
            stack. Instead, the creature gets the benefit of the best damage reduction in a given situation.

            see anything that they could not see otherwise—invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are
            still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, 암흑시야 subjects a creature to 시선 공격 normally.

            When a character is injured by a contaminated attack touches an item smeared with diseased matter, or

            disease has no effect—his immune system fought off the infection. If he fails, he takes damage after an
            incubation period. Once per day afterward, he must make a successful Fortitude 내성 굴림 to avoid repeated
            damage. Two successful 내성 굴림 in a row indicate that he has fought off the disease and recovers, taking
            no more damage.

              Use of the Heal skill can help a diseased character. Every time a diseased character makes a 내성 굴림
              against disease effects, the healer makes a check. The diseased character can use the healer’s result in
              place of his 내성 굴림 if the Heal check result is higher. The diseased character must be in the healer’s
              care and must have spent the previous 8 hours resting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Characters recover points lost to ability score damage at a rate of 1 per day per ability damaged, and
              this rule applies even while a disease is in progress. That means that a character with a minor disease
              might be able to withstand it without accumulating any damage.

          <h3>기력 손실 및 레벨 저하 현상</h3>
          <p>
            Some horrible creatures, especially undead monsters, possess a fearsome supernatural ability to drain levels
            from those they strike in combat. The creature making an energy drain attack draws a portion of its victim’s
            life force from her. Most energy drain attacks require a successful melee 명중 굴림—mere physical contact is
            not enough. Each successful energy drain attack bestows one or more negative levels on the opponent. A
            creature takes the following penalties for each negative level it has gained.
          </p>
          <p>–1 on all 스킬 판정 and ability checks.</p>
          <p>–1 on 명중 굴림 and 내성 굴림.</p>
          <p>–5 체력.</p>
          <p>
            –1 effective level (whenever the creature’s level is used in a die roll or calculation, reduce it by one for
            each negative level).
          </p>
          <p>
            If the victim casts spells, she loses access to one spell as if she had cast her highest-level, currently
            available spell. (If she has more than one spell at her highest level, she chooses which she loses.) In
            addition, when she next prepares spells or regains spell slots, she gets one less spell slot at her highest
            spell level.
          </p>
          <p>
            Negative levels remain for 24 hours or until removed with a spell, such as
            <span style="font-style: italic;">restoration. </span>After 24 hours, the afflicted creature must attempt a
            Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 attacker’s HD + attacker’s Cha modifier). (The DC is provided in the attacker’s
            description.) If the 내성 굴림 succeeds, the negative level goes away with no harm to the creature. The
            afflicted creature makes a separate 내성 굴림 for each negative level it has gained. If the save fails, the
            negative level goes away, but the creature’s level is also reduced by one.
          </p>
          <p>
            A character with negative levels at least equal to her current level, or drained below 1st level, is
            instantly slain. Depending on the creature that killed her, she may rise the next night as a monster of that
            kind. If not, she rises as a wight. A creature gains 5 temporary 체력 for each negative level it bestows
            (though not if the negative level is caused by a spell or similar effect).

          <h3>무형화</h3>
          <p>
            Phase spiders and certain other creatures can exist on the 무형의 Plane. While on the 무형의 Plane, a
            creature is called 무형의. Unlike incorporeal creatures, 무형의 creatures are not present on the
            Material Plane.
          </p>
          <p>
            무형의 creatures are invisible, inaudible, insubstantial, and scentless to creatures on the Material
            Plane. Even most magical attacks have no effect on them.
            <span style="font-style: italic;">See 투명상태 </span>and
            <span style="font-style: italic;">true seeing </span>reveal 무형의 creatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            An 무형의 creature can see and hear into the Material Plane in a 60-foot radius, though material objects
            still block sight and sound. (An 무형의 creature can’t see through a material wall, for instance.) An
            무형의 creature inside an object on the Material Plane cannot see. Things on the Material Plane, however,
            look gray, indistinct, and ghostly. An 무형의 creature can’t affect the Material Plane, not even
            magically. An 무형의 creature, however, interacts with other 무형의 creatures and objects the way
            material creatures interact with material creatures and objects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if a creature on the Material Plane can see an 무형의 creature the 무형의 creature is on another
            plane. Only force effects can affect the 무형의 creatures. If, on the other hand, both creatures are
            무형의, they can affect each other normally.
          </p>
          <p>
            A force effect originating on the Material Plane extends onto the 무형의 Plane, so that a
            <span style="font-style: italic;">wall of force </span>blocks an 무형의 creature, and a
            <span style="font-style: italic;">magic missile </span>can strike one (provided the spellcaster can see the
            무형의 target). Gaze effects and abjurations also extend from the Material Plane to the 무형의 Plane.
            None of these effects extend from the 무형의 Plane to the Material Plane.
          </p>
          <p>
            무형의 creatures move in any direction (including up or down) at will. They do not need to walk on the
            ground, and material objects don’t block them (though they can’t see while their eyes are within solid
            material).
          </p>
          <p>
            Ghosts have a power called manifestation that allows them to appear on the Material Plane as incorporeal
            creatures. Still, they are on the 무형의 Plane, and another 무형의 creature can interact normally with a
            manifesting ghost. 무형의 creatures pass through and operate in water as easily as air. 무형의 creatures
            do not fall or take falling damage.

          <h3>회피와 향상된 회피</h3>
          <p>
            These extraordinary abilities allow the target of an area attack to leap or twist out of the way. Rogues and
            monks have evasion and improved evasion as class features, but certain other creatures have these abilities,
            too.
          </p>
          <p>
            If subjected to an attack that allows a Reflex save for half damage, a character with evasion takes no
            damage on a successful save.
          </p>
          <p>
            As with a Reflex save for any creature, a character must have room to move in order to evade. A bound
            character or one squeezing through an area cannot use evasion.
          </p>
          <p>
            As with a Reflex save for any creature, evasion is a reflexive ability. The character need not know that the
            attack is coming to use evasion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rogues and monks cannot use evasion in medium or heavy armor. Some creatures with the evasion ability as an
            innate quality do not have this limitation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Improved evasion is like evasion, except that even on a failed 내성 굴림 the character takes only half
            damage.

            Spells, magic items, and certain monsters can affect characters with fear. In most cases, the character
            makes a Will 내성 굴림 to resist this effect, and a failed roll means that the character is shaken,
            frightened, or panicked.

            An opponent can avert his eyes from the creature’s face, looking at the creature’s body, watching its
            shadow, or tracking the creature in a reflective surface. Each round, the opponent has a 50% chance of not
            having to make a 내성 굴림. The creature with 시선 공격 gains concealment relative to the opponent. An
            opponent can shut his eyes, turn his back on the creature, or wear a blindfold. In these cases, the opponent
            does not need to make a 내성 굴림. The creature with 시선 공격 gains total concealment relative to the
            opponent.
          </p>
          <p>
            A creature with 시선 공격 can actively attempt to use its gaze as an attack action. The creature simply
            chooses a target within range, and that opponent must attempt a 내성 굴림. If the target has chosen to
            defend against the gaze as discussed above, the opponent gets a chance to avoid the 내성 굴림 (either 50%
            chance for averting eyes or 100% chance for shutting eyes). It is possible for an opponent to save against a
            creature’s gaze twice during the same round, once before its own action and once during the creature’s
            action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking at the creature’s image (such as in a mirror or as part of an illusion) does not subject the viewer
            to 시선 공격.
          </p>
          <p>A creature is immune to its own 시선 공격.</p>
          <p>
            If visibility is limited (by dim lighting, a fog, or the like) so that it results in concealment, there is a
            percentage chance equal to the normal miss chance for that degree of concealment that a character won’t need
            to make a 내성 굴림 in a given round. This chance is not cumulative with the chance for averting your eyes,
            but is rolled separately.
          </p>
          <p>Invisible creatures cannot use 시선 공격.</p>
          <p>Characters using 암흑시야 in complete darkness are affected by 시선 공격 normally.</p>
          <p>
            Unless specified otherwise, a creature with 시선 공격 can control its 시선 공격 and “turn it off ”
            when so desired.

          <h3>비실체상태</h3>
          <p>
            Spectres, wraiths, and a few other creatures lack physical bodies. Such creatures are insubstantial and
            can’t be touched by nonmagical matter or energy. Likewise, they cannot manipulate objects or exert physical
            force on objects. However, incorporeal beings have a tangible presence that sometimes seems like a physical
            attack against a corporeal creature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Incorporeal creatures are present on the same plane as the characters, and characters have some chance to
            affect them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Incorporeal creatures can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, by magic weapons, or by spells,
            spell-like effects, or supernatural effects. They are immune to all nonmagical attack forms. They are not
            burned by normal fires, affected by natural cold, or harmed by mundane acids.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even when struck by magic or magic weapons, an incorporeal creature has a 50% chance to ignore any damage
            from a corporeal source—except for a force effector damage dealt by a ghost touch weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Incorporeal creatures are immune to critical hits, extra damage from being favored enemies, and from sneak
            attacks. They move in any direction (including up or down) at will. They do not need to walk on the ground.
            They can pass through solid objects at will, although they cannot see when their eyes are within solid
            matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Incorporeal creatures hiding inside solid objects get a +2 circumstance bonus on Listen checks, because
            solid objects carry sound well. Pinpointing an opponent from inside a solid object uses the same rules as
            pinpointing invisible opponents (see 투명상태, below).
          </p>
          <p>Incorporeal creatures are inaudible unless they decide to make noise.</p>
          <p>
            The physical attacks of incorporeal creatures ignore material armor, even magic armor, unless it is made of
            force (such as mage armor or bracers of armor) or has the ghost touch ability.
          </p>
          <p>Incorporeal creatures pass through and operate in water as easily as they do in air.</p>
          <p>Incorporeal creatures cannot fall or take falling damage.</p>
          <p>Corporeal creatures cannot trip or grapple incorporeal creatures.</p>
          <p>Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight.</p>
          <p>
            Incorporeal creatures do not leave footprints, have no scent, and make no noise unless they manifest, and
            even then they only make noise intentionally.

          <h3>투명상태</h3>
          <p>
            The ability to move about unseen is not foolproof. While they can’t be seen, invisible creatures can be
            heard, smelled, or felt.
          </p>
          <p>투명상태 makes a creature undetectable by vision, including 암흑시야.</p>
          <p>
            투명상태 does not, by itself, make a creature immune to critical hits, but it does make the creature
            immune to extra damage from being a ranger’s favored enemy and from sneak attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            A creature can generally notice the presence of an active invisible creature within 30 feet with a DC 20
            Spot check. The observer gains a hunch that “something’s there” but can’t see it or target it accurately
            with an attack. A creature who is holding still is very hard to notice (DC 30). An inanimate object, an
            unliving creature holding still, or a completely immobile creature is even harder to spot (DC 40). It’s
            practically impossible (+20 DC) to pinpoint an invisible creature’s location with a Spot check, and even if
            a character succeeds on such a check, the invisible creature still benefits from total concealment (50% miss
            chance).
          </p>
          <p>
            A creature can use hearing to find an invisible creature. A character can make a Listen check for this
            purpose as a free action each round. A Listen check result at least equal to the invisible creature’s Move
            Silently check result reveals its presence. (A creature with no ranks in Move Silently makes a Move Silently
            check as a Dexterity check to which an armor check penalty applies.) A successful check lets a character
            hear an invisible creature “over there somewhere.” It’s practically impossible to pinpoint the location of
            an invisible creature. A Listen check that beats the DC by 20 pinpoints the invisible creature’s location.

            A creature can grope about to find an invisible creature. A character can make a touch attack with his hands
            or a weapon into two adjacent 5-foot squares using a standard action. If an invisible target is in the
            designated area, there is a 50% miss chance on the touch attack. If successful, the groping character deals
            no damage but has successfully pinpointed the invisible creature’s current location. (If the invisible
            creature moves, its location, obviously, is once again unknown.)
          </p>
          <p>
            If an invisible creature strikes a character, the character struck still knows the location of the creature
            that struck him (until, of course, the invisible creature moves). The only exception is if the invisible
            creature has a reach greater than 5 feet. In this case, the struck character knows the general location of
            the creature but has not pinpointed the exact location.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose location he has pinpointed, he attacks normally,
            but the invisible creature still benefits from full concealment (and thus a 50% miss chance). A particularly
            large and slow creature might get a smaller miss chance.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose location he has not pinpointed, have the player
            choose the space where the character will direct the attack. If the invisible creature is there, conduct the
            attack normally. If the enemy’s not there, roll the miss chance as if it were there, don’t let the player
            see the result, and tell him that the character has missed. That way the player doesn’t know whether the
            attack missed because the enemy’s not there or because you successfully rolled the miss chance.
          </p>
          <p>
            If an invisible character picks up a visible object, the object remains visible. One could coat an invisible
            object with flour to at least keep track of its position (until the flour fell off or blew away). An
            invisible creature can pick up a small visible item and hide it on his person (tucked in a pocket or behind
            a cloak) and render it effectively invisible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Invisible creatures leave tracks. They can be tracked normally. Footprints in sand, mud, or other soft
            surfaces can give enemies clues to an invisible creature’s location.
          </p>
          <p>
            An invisible creature in the water displaces water, revealing its location. The invisible creature, however,
            is still hard to see and benefits from concealment.
          </p>
          <p>A creature with the scent ability can detect an invisible creature as it would a visible one.</p>
          <p>
            A creature with the 장님 전투 feat has a better chance to hit an invisible creature. Roll the miss chance
            twice, and he misses only if both rolls indicate a miss. (Alternatively, make one 25% miss chance roll
            rather than two 50% miss chance rolls.)
          </p>
          <p>
            A creature with blindsight can attack (and otherwise interact with) creatures regardless of 투명상태.

            An invisible burning torch still gives off light, as does an invisible object with a light spell (or similar
            spell) cast upon it.
          </p>
          <p>
            무형의 creatures are invisible. Since 무형의 creatures are not materially present, Spot checks, Listen
            checks, Scent, 장님 전투, and blindsight don’t help locate them. Incorporeal creatures are often invisible.
            Scent, 장님 전투, and blindsight don’t help creatures find or attack invisible, incorporeal creatures, but
            Spot checks and possibly Listen checks can help.

          <p>
            Since some creatures can detect or even see invisible creatures, it is helpful to be able to hide even when
            invisible.

          <p>
            When a character takes damage from an attack with a poisoned weapon, touches an item smeared with contact
            poison, consumes poisoned food or drink, or is otherwise poisoned, he must make a Fortitude 내성 굴림. If he
            fails, he takes the poison’s initial damage (usually ability damage). Even if he succeeds, he typically
            faces more damage 1 minute later, which he can also avoid with a successful Fortitude 내성 굴림.
          </p>
          <p>
            One dose of poison smeared on a weapon or some other object affects just a single target. A poisoned weapon
            or object retains its venom until the weapon scores a hit or the object is touched (unless the poison is
            wiped off before a target comes in contact with it). Any poison smeared on an object or exposed to the
            elements in any way remains potent until it is touched or used.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although supernatural and spell-like poisons are possible, poisonous effects are almost always
            extraordinary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Poisons can be divided into four basic types according to the method by which their effect is delivered, as
            follows.

          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Contact:</span
            ><span>
              Merely touching this type of poison necessitates a 내성 굴림. It can be actively delivered via a weapon or
              a touch attack. Even if a creature has sufficient damage reduction to avoid taking any damage from the
              attack, the poison can still affect it. A chest or other object can be smeared with contact poison as part
              of a trap.</span

          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Ingested:</span
            ><span>
              Ingested poisons are virtually impossible to utilize in a combat situation. A poisoner could administer a
              potion to an unconscious creature or attempt to dupe someone into drinking or eating something poisoned.
              암살자 and other characters tend to use ingested poisons outside of combat.</span

          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Inhaled:</span
            ><span>
              Inhaled poisons are usually contained in fragile vials or eggshells. They can be thrown as a ranged attack
              with a range increment of 10 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), the container
              releases its poison. One dose spreads to fill the volume of a 10-foot cube. Each creature within the area
              must make a 내성 굴림. (Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons; they affect the nasal
              membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.)</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Injury:</span
            ><span>
              This poison must be delivered through a wound. If a creature has sufficient damage reduction to avoid
              taking any damage from the attack, the poison does not affect it. Traps that cause damage from weapons,
              needles, and the like sometimes contain injury poisons.</span

            <h4>독 사용의 위험성</h4>
            <p>
              A character has a 5% chance of exposing himself to a poison whenever he applies it to a weapon or
              otherwise readies it for use. Additionally, a character who rolls a natural 1 on an 명중 굴림 with a
              poisoned weapon must make a DC 15 Reflex save or accidentally poison himself with the weapon.

          <section id="h4-29-poison-immunities">
            <h4>독 내성</h4>
            <p>
              Creatures with natural poison attacks are immune to their own poison. Nonliving creatures (constructs and
              undead) and creatures without metabolisms (such as elementals) are always immune to poison. Oozes, plants,
              and certain kinds of outsiders are also immune to poison, although conceivably special poisons could be
              concocted specifically to harm them.

            Magic can cause creatures and characters to change their shapes—sometimes against their will, but usually to
            gain an advantage. Polymorphed creatures retain their own minds but have new physical forms.
          </p>
          <p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">polymorph </span>spell defines the general polymorph effect.</p>
          <p>
            Since creatures do not change types, a slaying or bane weapon designed to kill or harm creatures of a
            specific type affects those creatures even if they are polymorphed. Likewise, a creature polymorphed into
            the form of a creature of a different type is not subject to slaying and bane effects directed at that type
            of creature.
          </p>
          <p>
            A ranger’s favored enemy bonus is based on knowing what the foe is, so if a creature that is a ranger’s
            favored enemy polymorphs into another form, the ranger is denied his bonus.
          </p>
          <p>
            A dwarf ’s bonus for fighting giants is based on shape and size, so he does not gain a bonus against a giant
            polymorphed into something else, but does gain the bonus against any creature polymorphed into a giant.

            Telepathy, mental combat and psychic powers—psionics is a catchall word that describes special mental
            abilities possessed by various creatures. These are spell-like abilities that a creature generates from the
            power of its mind alone—no other outside magical force or ritual is needed. Each psionic creature’s
            description contains details on its psionic abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Psionic attacks almost always allow Will 내성 굴림 to resist them. However, not all psionic attacks are
            mental attacks. Some psionic abilities allow the psionic creature to reshape its own body, heal its wounds,
            or teleport great distances. Some psionic creatures can see into the future, the past, and the present (in
            far-off locales) as well as read the minds of others.

            All ray attacks require the attacker to make a successful ranged touch attack against the target. Rays have
            varying ranges, which are simple maximums. A ray’s 명중 굴림 never takes a range penalty. Even if a ray
            hits, it usually allows the target to make a 내성 굴림 (Fortitude or Will). Rays never allow a Reflex 내성
            굴림, but if a character’s Dexterity bonus to AC is high, it might be hard to hit her with the ray in the
            first place.

            Creatures with this extraordinary ability recover from wounds quickly and can even regrow or reattach
            severed body parts. Damage dealt to the creature is treated as 비치명적인 피해, and the creature
            automatically cures itself of 비치명적인 피해 at a fixed rate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certain attack forms, typically fire and acid, deal damage to the creature normally; that sort of damage
            doesn’t convert to 비치명적인 피해 and so doesn’t go away. The creature’s description includes the details.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creatures with regeneration can regrow lost portions of their bodies and can reattach severed limbs or body
            parts. Severed parts die if they are not reattached.
          </p>
          <p>Regeneration does not restore 체력 lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation.</p>
          <p>Attack forms that don’t deal 체력 damage ignore regeneration.</p>
          <p>
            An attack that can cause instant death only threatens the creature with death if it is delivered by weapons
            that deal it lethal damage.

          <h3>에너지 저항</h3>
          <p>
            A creature with resistance to energy has the ability (usually extraordinary) to ignore some damage of a
            certain type each round, but it does not have total immunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each resistance ability is defined by what energy type it resists and how many points of damage are
            resisted. It doesn’t matter whether the damage has a mundane or magical source.
          </p>
          <p>
            When resistance completely negates the damage from an energy attack, the attack does not disrupt a spell.
            This resistance does not stack with the resistance that a spellmight provide.

        <section id="h3-35-scent">
          <h3>냄새</h3>
          <p>
            This extraordinary ability lets a creature detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by
            sense of smell.
          </p>
          <p>
            A creature with the scent ability can detect opponents by sense of smell, generally within 30 feet. If the
            opponent is upwind, the range is 60 feet. If it is downwind, the range is 15 feet. Strong scents, such as
            smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as
            skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at three times these ranges.
          </p>
          <p>
            The creature detects another creature’s presence but not its specific location. Noting the direction of the
            scent is a move action. If it moves within 5 feet of the scent’s source, the creature can pinpoint that
            source.
          </p>
          <p>
            A creature with the Track feat and the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom check to
            find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10. The DC increases or decreases depending on
            how strong the quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the
            trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. Creatures
            tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.
          </p>
          <p>Creatures with the scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights.</p>
          <p>
            Water, particularly running water, ruins a trail for air-breathing creatures. Water-breathing creatures that
            have the scent ability, however, can use it in the water easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            False, powerful odors can easily mask other scents. The presence of such an odor completely spoils the
            ability to properly detect or identify creatures, and the base Survival DC to track becomes 20 rather than
            10.

        <section id="h3-36-spell-resistance">
          <h3>주문 저항</h3>
          <p>
            Spell resistance is the extraordinary ability to avoid being affected by spells. (Some spells also grant
            spell resistance.)
          </p>
          <p>
            To affect a creature that has spell resistance, a spellcaster must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster
            level) at least equal to the creature’s spell resistance. (The defender’s spell resistance is like an 방어도
            against magical attacks.) If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn’t affect the creature. The
            possessor does not have to do anything special to use spell resistance. The creature need not even be aware
            of the threat for its spell resistance to operate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only spells and spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance. Extraordinary and supernatural
            abilities (including enhancement bonuses on magic weapons) are not. A creature can have some abilities that
            are subject to spell resistance and some that are not. Even some spells ignore spell resistance; see When
            Spell Resistance Applies, below.
          </p>
          <p>
            A creature can voluntarily lower its spell resistance. Doing so is a standard action that does not provoke
            an attack of opportunity. Once a creature lowers its resistance, it remains down until the creature’s next
            turn. At the beginning of the creature’s next turn, the creature’s spell resistance automatically returns
            unless the creature intentionally keeps it down (also a standard action that does not provoke an attack of
            opportunity).
          </p>
          <p>A creature’s spell resistance never interferes with its own spells, items, or abilities.</p>
          <p>
            A creature with spell resistance cannot impart this power to others by touching them or standing in their
            midst. Only the rarest of creatures and a few magic items have the ability to bestow spell resistance upon
            another.
          </p>
          <p>Spell resistance does not stack. It overlaps.</p>

              Each spell includes an entry that indicates whether spell resistance applies to the spell. In general,
              whether spell resistance applies depends on what the spell does:

              ><span>
                Spell resistance applies if the spell is targeted at the creature. Some individually targeted spells can
                be directed at several creatures simultaneously. In such cases, a creature’s spell resistance applies
                only to the portion of the spell actually targeted at that creature. If several different resistant
                creatures are subjected to such a spell, each checks its spell resistance separately.</span

              ><span>
                Spell resistance applies if the resistant creature is within the spell’s area. It protects the resistant
                creature without affecting the spell itself.</span

              <span style="font-weight: 700;">Effect Spells:</span
              ><span>
                Most effect spells summon or create something and are not subject to spell resistance. Sometimes,
                however, spell resistance applies to effect spells, usually to those that act upon a creature more or
                less directly, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">web.</span></span

              Spell resistance can protect a creature from a spell that’s already been cast. Check spell resistance when
              the creature is first affected by the spell.
            </p>
            <p>
              Check spell resistance only once for any particular casting of a spell or use of a spell-like ability. If
              spell resistance fails the first time, it fails each time the creature encounters that same casting of the
              spell. Likewise, if the spell resistance succeeds the first time, it always succeeds. If the creature has
              voluntarily lowered its spell resistance and is then subjected to a spell, the creature still has a single
              chance to resist that spell later, when its spell resistance is up.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spell resistance has no effect unless the energy created or released by the spell actually goes to work on
              the resistant creature’s mind or body. If the spell acts on anything else and the creature is affected as
              a consequence, no roll is required. Creatures can be harmed by a spell without being directly affected.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spell resistance does not apply if an effect fools the creature’s senses or reveals something about the
              creature.
            </p>
            <p>
              Magic actually has to be working for spell resistance to apply. Spells that have instantaneous durations
              but lasting results aren’t subject to spell resistance unless the resistant creature is exposed to the
              spell the instant it is cast.
            </p>
            <p>When in doubt about whether a spell’s effect is direct or indirect, consider the spell’s school:</p>

                These spells are subject to spell resistance if they transform the target creature. Transmutation spells
                are not subject to spell resistance if they are targeted on a point in space instead of on a creature.
                Some transmutations make objects harmful (or more harmful), such as
                <span style="font-style: italic;">magic stone</span>. Even these spells are not generally subject to
                spell resistance because they affect the objects, not the creatures against which the objects are used.
                Spell resistance works against <span style="font-style: italic;">magic stone </span>only if the creature

            <p>
              Spell resistance prevents a spell or a spell-like ability from affecting or harming the resistant
              creature, but it never removes a magical effect from another creature or negates a spell’s effect on
              another creature. Spell resistance prevents a spell from disrupting another spell.
            </p>
            <p>
              Against an ongoing spell that has already been cast, a failed check against spell resistance allows the
              resistant creature to ignore any effect the spell might have. The magic continues to affect others
              normally.

            A creature with tremorsense automatically senses the location of anything that is in contact with the ground
            and within range.
          </p>
          <p>
            If no straight path exists through the ground from the creature to those that it’s sensing, then the range
            defines the maximum distance of the shortest indirect path. It must itself be in contact with the ground,
            and the creatures must be moving.

          <p>
            As long as the other creatures are taking physical actions, including casting spells with somatic
            components, they’re considered moving; they don’t have to move from place to place for a creature with

            performing any standard action (or any other action the DM deems strenuous, including some free actions such
            as casting a quickened spell) deals 1 point of damage after the completion of the act. Unless the action

            dropped below 0 체력), the character rolls d% to see whether she becomes stable. She has a 10% chance to
            become stable. If she does not, she loses 1 체력. If a dying character reaches –10 체력, she is dead.</span

            the following penalties: –1 penalty on 명중 굴림, 내성 굴림, 스킬 판정, ability checks; loss of 5 체력; and
            –1 to effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or 특수 능력). In addition, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from the highest spell level

            half speed, cannot run or charge, and takes a –2 penalty on all 명중 굴림 and a –4 penalty to Dexterity. An

            Engaged in wrestling or some other form of hand-to-hand struggle with one or more attackers. A grappling
            character can undertake only a limited number of actions. He does not threaten any squares, and loses his
            Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) against opponents he isn’t grappling.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Helpless:</span
          ><span>
            A helpless character is paralyzed, <span style="font-style: italic;">held</span>, bound, sleeping,
            unconscious, or otherwise completely at an opponent’s mercy. A helpless target is treated as having a
            Dexterity of 0 (–5 modifier). Melee attacks against a helpless target get a +4 bonus (equivalent to
            attacking a prone target). Ranged attacks gets no special bonus against helpless targets. Rogues can sneak
            attack helpless targets.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          As a full-round action, an enemy can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless foe. An enemy
          can also use a bow or crossbow, provided he is adjacent to the target. The attacker automatically hits and
          scores a critical hit. (A rogue also gets her sneak attack damage bonus against a helpless foe when delivering
          a coup de grace.) If the defender survives, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die.
        </p>
        <p>Delivering a coup de grace provokes 기회 공격.</p>
        <p>
          Creatures that are immune to critical hits do not take critical damage, nor do they need to make Fortitude
          saves to avoid being killed by a coup de grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Incorporeal: </span
          ><span
            >Having no physical body. Incorporeal creatures are immune to all nonmagical attack forms. They can be
            harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons, spells, spell-like effects, or
            supernatural effects.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Invisible:</span
          ><span>
            Visually undetectable. An invisible creature gains a +2 bonus on 명중 굴림 against sighted opponents, and
            ignores its opponents’ Dexterity bonuses to AC (if any). (See 투명상태, under 특수 능력.)</span

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Knocked Down:</span
          ><span>
            Depending on their size, creatures can be knocked down by winds of high velocity. Creatures on the ground
            are knocked prone by the force of the wind. Flying creatures are instead blown back 1d6 x 10 feet.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Nauseated:</span
          ><span>
            Experiencing stomach distress. Nauseated creatures are unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells,
            or do anything else requiring attention. The only action such a character can take is a single move action
            per turn.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Panicked: </span
          ><span
            >A panicked creature must drop anything it holds and flee at top speed from the source of its fear, as well
            as any other dangers it encounters, along a random path. It can’t take any other actions. In addition, the
            creature takes a –2 penalty on all 내성 굴림, 스킬 판정, and ability checks. If cornered, a panicked
            creature cowers and does not attack, typically using the 총력 방어 action in combat. A panicked creature can
            use 특수 능력, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the
            only way to escape.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>Panicked is a more extreme state of fear than shaken or frightened.</p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Paralyzed:</span
          ><span>
            A paralyzed character is frozen in place and unable to move or act. A paralyzed character has effective
            Dexterity and Strength scores of 0 and is helpless, but can take purely mental actions. A winged creature
            flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A paralyzed swimmer
            can’t swim and may drown. A creature can move through a space occupied by a paralyzed creature—ally or not.
            Each square occupied by a paralyzed creature, however, counts as 2 squares.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Petrified:</span
          ><span>
            A petrified character has been turned to stone and is considered unconscious. If a petrified character
            cracks or breaks, but the broken pieces are joined with the body as he returns to flesh, he is unharmed. If
            the character’s petrified body is incomplete when it returns to flesh, the body is likewise incomplete and
            there is some amount of permanent 체력 loss and/or debilitation.</span

        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Pinned:</span><span> Held immobile (but not helpless) in a grapple.</span>

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Prone:</span
          ><span>
            The character is on the ground. An attacker who is prone has a –4 penalty on melee 명중 굴림 and cannot use
            a ranged weapon (except for a crossbow). A defender who is prone gains a +4 bonus to 방어도 against ranged
            attacks, but takes a –4 penalty to AC against melee attacks.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>Standing up is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity.</p>

          ><span>A shaken character takes a –2 penalty on 명중 굴림, 내성 굴림, 스킬 판정, and ability checks.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Shaken is a less severe state of fear than frightened or panicked.</p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Sickened:</span
          ><span>
            The character takes a –2 penalty on all 명중 굴림, weapon damage rolls, 내성 굴림, 스킬 판정, and ability
            checks.</span

        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Stable:</span
          ><span>
            A character who was dying but who has stopped losing 체력 and still has negative 체력 is stable. The
            character is no longer dying, but is still unconscious. If the character has become stable because of aid
            from another character (such as a Heal check or magical healing), then the character no longer loses 체력.
            He has a 10% chance each hour of becoming conscious and disabled (even though his 체력 are still negative).
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          If the character became stable on his own and hasn’t had help, he is still at risk of losing 체력. Each hour,
          he has a 10% chance of becoming conscious and disabled. Otherwise he loses 1 체력.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Staggered:</span
          ><span>
            A character whose 비치명적인 피해 exactly equals his current 체력 is staggered. A staggered character may
            take a single move action or standard action each round (but not both, nor can she take full-round
            actions).</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          A character whose current 체력 exceed his 비치명적인 피해 is no longer staggered; a character whose 비치명적인
          피해 exceeds his 체력 becomes unconscious.
        </p>

The observer gains a hunch that “something’s there” but can’t see it or target it accurately\n            with an attack. A creature who is holding still is very hard to notice (DC 30). An inanimate object, an\n            unliving creature holding still, or a completely immobile creature is even harder to spot (DC 40). It’s\n            practically impossible (+20 DC) to pinpoint an invisible creature’s location with a Spot check, and even if\n            a character succeeds on such a check, the invisible creature still benefits from total concealment (50% miss\n            chance).\n          \u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003cp\u003e\n            A creature can use hearing to find an invisible creature.

(A creature with no ranks in Move Silently makes a Move Silently\n            check as a Dexterity check to which an armor check penalty applies.) A successful check lets a character\n            hear an invisible creature “over there somewhere.” It’s practically impossible to pinpoint the location of\n            an invisible creature.

Sometimes,\n                however, spell resistance applies to effect spells, usually to those that act upon a creature more or\n                less directly, such as \u003cspan style=\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eweb.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\n              \u003e\n            \u003c/p\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003e\n              Spell resistance can protect a creature from a spell that’s already been cast.

Likewise, if the spell resistance succeeds the first time, it always succeeds. If the creature has\n              voluntarily lowered its spell resistance and is then subjected to a spell, the creature still has a single\n              chance to resist that spell later, when its spell resistance is up.\n            \u003c/p\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003e\n              Spell resistance has no effect unless the energy created or released by the spell actually goes to work on\n              the resistant creature’s mind or body.
