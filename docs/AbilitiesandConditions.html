        <p>A special ability is either extraordinary, spell-like, or supernatural in nature.</p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">Extraordinary 능력(Ex):</span
          ><span>
            Extraordinary 능력 are nonmagical. They are, however, not something that just anyone can do or even learn to
            do without extensive training. Effects or 범위 that negate or disrupt magic have no effect on extraordinary
            능력.</span

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">Spell-Like 능력(Sp):</span
          ><span>
            Spell-like 능력, as 이름 implies, are 주문 and magical 능력 that are very much like 주문. Spell-like
            능력 are subject to 주문 저항 and <span style="font-style: italic">마법 무효화</span>. They do not function
            in 범위 where magic is suppressed or negated (such as an
            <span style="font-style: italic">대마법 보호장</span>).</span

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">Supernatural 능력(Su):</span
          ><span>
            Supernatural 능력 are magical but not spell-like. Supernatural 능력 are not subject to 주문 저항 and do not
            function in 범위 where magic is suppressed or negated (such as an
            <span style="font-style: italic">대마법 보호장</span>). A supernatural ability’s effect cannot be dispelled
            and is not subject to 주문 무효화. See the table below for a summary of the types of 특수 능력.</span

          <div class="original-headline">ABILITY SCORE LOSS</div>
          <p>
            Various 공격 cause 능력 점수 손실, either ability 피해 or ability drain. Points lost to ability 피해 return
            at the rate of 1 point per day (or double that if the character gets complete bed rest) to each damaged
            ability, and 주문 <span style="font-style: italic">하급 복원 </span>and
            <span style="font-style: italic">복원 </span>offset ability 피해 as well. Ability drain, however, is
            permanent, though <span style="font-style: italic">복원 </span>can restore even those lost ability score
            points.
          </p>
          <p>While any loss is debilitating, losing all points in an ability score can be devastating.</p>
          <p>• 근력 0 means that the character cannot 이동 at all. He lies helpless on the ground.</p>
          <p>• 민첩 0 means that the character cannot 이동 at all. He stands motionless, rigid, and helpless.</p>
          <p>• 건강 0 means that the character is 죽음.</p>
          <p>• 지능 0 means that the character cannot think and is unconscious in a coma-like stupor, helpless.</p>
          <p>• 지혜 0 means that the character is withdrawn into a deep 수면 filled with 밤마귀, helpless.</p>
          <p>• 매력 0 means that the character is withdrawn into a catatonic, coma-like stupor, helpless.</p>
          <p>
            Keeping 추적 of negative ability score points is never necessary. A character’s ability score can’t drop
            below 0.
          </p>
          <p>Having a score of 0 in an ability is different from having no ability score whatsoever.</p>
          <p>
            Some 주문 or 능력 impose an effective ability score reduction, which is different from 능력 점수 손실. Any
            such reduction disappears at the end of the spell’s or ability’s 지속시간, and the ability score immediately
            returns to its former value.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a character’s 건강 score drops, then he loses 1 hit point per Hit Die for every point by which his 건강
            수정치 drops. A hit point score can’t be reduced by 건강 피해 or drain to less than 1 hit point per Hit
            Die.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ability that some creatures have to drain 능력 점수 is a supernatural one, requiring some sort of 공격.
            Such creatures do not drain 능력 from enemies when the enemies strike them, even with unarmed 공격 or
            natural 무기.

          <h3>항마</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">ANTIMAGIC</div>
          <p>
            An <span style="font-style: italic">대마법 보호장 </span>spell or effect cancels magic altogether. An 항마
            effect has the following powers and characteristics.
          </p>
          <p>
            • No supernatural ability, spell-like ability, or spell works in an 범위 of 항마(but extraordinary 능력
            still work).
          </p>
          <p>
            • 항마 does not 마법 무효화; it suppresses it. Once a magical effect is no longer affected by 항마(the
            항마 fades, the center of the effect 이동 away, and so on), the magic returns. 주문 that still have part of
            their 지속시간 left begin functioning again, 마법 아이템 are once again useful, and so forth.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Spell 범위 that include both an 항마 범위 and a normal 범위, but are not centered in 항마 범위, still
            function in the normal 범위. If the spell’s center is in 항마 범위, then the spell is suppressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            • 골렘 and other constructs, 정령, outsiders, and corporeal undead, still function in an 항마 범위(though
            항마 범위 suppresses their spellcasting and their supernatural and spell-like 능력 normally). If such
            creatures are summoned or conjured, however, see below.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Summoned or conjured creatures of any type, as well as incorporeal undead, wink out if they enter 범위
            of an 항마 effect. They reappear in the same 감지 once the field goes away.
          </p>
          <p>
            • 마법 아이템 with continuous effectsdo not function in 범위 of an 항마 effect, but their effects are
            not canceled (so the contents of a <span style="font-style: italic">bag of holding</span> are unavailable,
            but neither spill out nor disappear forever).
          </p>
          <p>• Two 항마 범위 in the same place do not cancel each other out, nor do they stack.</p>
          <p>
            • <span style="font-style: italic">힘의 장벽, 무지갯빛 벽, </span>and
            <span style="font-style: italic">무지갯빛의 구 </span>are not affected by 항마.

          <p>
            Some creatures have blindsight, the extraordinary ability to use a nonvisual sense (or a combination of such
            senses) to operate effectively without 시야. Such sense may include sensitivity to vibrations, acute 냄새,
            keen hearing, or echolocation. This ability makes 투명화 and 은폐(even magical 암흑) irrelevant to the
            creature (though it still can’t see ethereal creatures). This ability operates out to a 거리 specified in
            the creature 묘사.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Blindsight never allows a creature to distinguish color or visual contrast. A creature cannot read with
            blindsight.
          </p>
          <p>• Blindsight does not subject a creature to 시선 공격(even though 암흑시야 does).</p>
          <p>• Blinding 공격 do not penalize creatures using blindsight.</p>
          <p>• Deafening 공격 thwart blindsight if it relies on hearing.</p>
          <p>• Blindsight works underwater but not in a vacuum.</p>
          <p>• Blindsight negates 변위 and 흐릿함 effects.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700">Blindsense:</span
            ><span>
              Other creatures have blindsense, a 하급 ability that lets the creature notice things it cannot see, but
              without the precision of blindsight. The creature with blindsense usually does not need to make 감지 or
              듣기 checks to notice and 생명체 위치파악 within 거리 of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line
              of effect to that creature. Any opponent the creature cannot see has total 은폐(50% miss chance) against
              the creature with blindsense, and the blindsensing creature still has the normal miss chance when
              attacking foes that have 은폐. Visibility still affects 이동 of a creature with blindsense. A creature
              with blindsense is still denied its 민첩 보너스 to 방어도 against 공격 from creatures it cannot see.</span

          <div class="original-headline">BREATH WEAPON</div>
          <p>
            A creature attacking with a 브레스 무기 is actually expelling something from its mouth (rather than
            conjuring it by means of a spell or some other magical effect). Most creatures with 브레스 무기 are limited
            to a number of uses per day or by a minimum length of time that must pass between uses. Such creatures are
            usually smart enough to save their 브레스 무기 until they really need it.
          </p>
          <p>• Using a 브레스 무기 is typically a standard action.</p>
          <p>• No 명중 굴림 is necessary. The breath simply fills its stated 범위.</p>
          <p>
            • Any character caught in 범위 must make the appropriate 내성 굴림 or suffer 브레스 무기’s full
            effect. In many cases, a character who succeeds on his 내성 굴림 still takes half 피해 or some other reduced
            effect.
          </p>
          <p>• 브레스 무기 are supernatural 능력 except where noted.</p>
          <p>• Creatures are immune to their own 브레스 무기.</p>

          <h3>매혹과 명령</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">CHARM AND COMPULSION</div>
          <p>
            Many 능력 and 주문 can cloud the minds of characters and 몬스터, leaving them unable to tell friend from
            foe—or worse yet, deceiving them into thinking that their former friends are now their worst enemies. Two
            general types of 부여술 affect characters and creatures: charms and compulsions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Charming another creature gives the charming character the ability to befriend and suggest courses of
            actions to his minion, but the servitude is not absolute or mindless. Charms of this type include the
            various <span style="font-style: italic">charm </span>주문. Essentially, a
            <span style="font-style: italic">charmed </span>character retains free will but makes choices according to a
            skewed view of the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            • A <span style="font-style: italic">charmed </span>creature doesn’t gain any magical ability to understand
            his new friend’s language.
          </p>
          <p>
            • A <span style="font-style: italic">charmed </span>character retains his original 성향 and allegiances,
            generally with the exception that he now regards the
            <span style="font-style: italic">charming </span>creature as a dear friend and will give great weight to his
            제안 and directions.
          </p>
          <p>
            • A <span style="font-style: italic">charmed </span>character fights his former allies only if they threaten
            his new friend, and even then he uses the least lethal means at his disposal as long as these tactics show
            any possibility of success (just as he would in a fight between two actual friends).
          </p>
          <p>
            • A <span style="font-style: italic">charmed </span>character is entitled to an opposed 매력 check against
            his master in order to resist instructions or 명령 that would make him do something he wouldn’t normally do
            even for a close friend. If he succeeds, he decides not to go along with that order but remains
            <span style="font-style: italic">charmed.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            • A <span style="font-style: italic">charmed </span>character never obeys a 명령 that is obviously suicidal
            or grievously harmful to her.
          </p>
          <p>
            • If the charming creature 명령 his minion to do something that the influenced character would be violently
            opposed to, the subject may attempt a new 내성 굴림 to break free of the influence altogether.
          </p>
          <p>
            • A <span style="font-style: italic">charmed </span>character who is openly attacked by the creature who
            <span style="font-style: italic">charmed </span>him or by that creature’s apparent allies is automatically
            freed of the spell or effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compulsion is a different matter altogether. A compulsion overrides the subject’s free will in some way or
            simply changes the way the subject’s mind works. A charm makes the subject a friend of the caster; a
            compulsion makes the subject obey the caster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of whether a character is charmed or compelled, he won’t volunteer information or tactics that
            his master doesn’t ask for.

          <div class="original-headline">COLD IMMUNITY</div>
          <p>
            A creature with 냉기 내성 never takes cold 피해. It has vulnerability to fire, which means it takes half
            again as much (+50%) 피해 as normal from fire, regardless of whether a 내성 굴림 is allowed, or if the save
            is a success or failure.

          <h3>피해 축소</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">DAMAGE REDUCTION</div>
          <p>
            Some magic creatures have the supernatural ability to instantly 치료 피해 from 무기 or to ignore blows
            altogether as though they were invulnerable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The numerical part of a creature’s 피해 축소 is the amount of 히트 포인트 the creature ignores from normal
            공격. Usually, a certain type of weapon can overcome this reduction. This information is separated from the
            피해 축소 number by a slash. 피해 축소 may be overcome by 특수 재료, by 마법 무기(any weapon with a +1 or
            higher enhancement 보너스, not counting the enhancement from masterwork quality), certain types of 무기(such
            as slashing or bludgeoning), and 무기 imbued with an 성향. If a dash follows the slash then 피해 축소 is
            effective against any 공격 that does not ignore 피해 축소.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement 보너스 of +1 or higher is treated as a 마법
            무기 for 목적 of overcoming 피해 축소. Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an 성향
            gains 성향 of that projectile weapon (in addition to any 성향 it may already have).
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever 피해 축소 completely negates 피해 from an 공격, it also negates most special effects that
            accompany 공격, such as injury type 독, a 수도사’s stunning, and injury type 질병. 피해 축소 does not
            negate touch 공격, energy 피해 dealt along with an 공격, or 정령 흡수. Nor does it affect 독 or 질병
            delivered by inhalation, ingestion, or contact.
          </p>
          <p>공격 that deal no 피해 because of the target’s 피해 축소 do not disrupt 주문.</p>
          <p>주문, spell-like 능력, and energy 공격(even nonmagical fire) ignore 피해 축소.</p>
          <p>
            Sometimes 피해 축소 is instant 치료. Sometimes 피해 축소 represents the creature’s tough 숨기 or body,. In
            either case, characters can see that conventional 공격 don’t work.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a creature has 피해 축소 from more than one source, the two forms of 피해 축소 do not stack. Instead, the
            creature gets the benefit of the best 피해 축소 in a given situation.

            암흑시야 is the extraordinary ability to see with no 빛 source at all, out to a 거리 specified for the
            creature. 암흑시야 is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see
            anything that they could not see otherwise—invisible objects are still invisible, and 환영술 are still
            visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, 암흑시야 subjects a creature to 시선 공격 normally. The presence
            of 빛 does not spoil 암흑시야.

            When a character is injured by a contaminated 공격 touches an item smeared with diseased matter, or consumes
            질병-tainted food or drink, he must make an immediate Fortitude 내성 굴림. If he succeeds, 질병 has no

            Once per day afterward, he must make a successful Fortitude 내성 굴림 to avoid repeated 피해. Two successful

              Use of 치료 skill can help a diseased character. Every time a diseased character makes a 내성 굴림
              against 질병 effects, the healer makes a check. The diseased character can use the healer’s result in
              place of his 내성 굴림 if 치료 check result is higher. The diseased character must be in the healer’s
              care and must have spent the previous 8 hours resting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Characters recover points lost to ability score 피해 at a rate of 1 per day per ability damaged, and this
              rule applies even while a 질병 is in progress. That means that a character with a minor 질병 might be able
              to withstand it without accumulating any 피해.

          <h3>에너지 흡수 및 레벨 저하 현상</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">ENERGY DRAIN AND NEGATIVE LEVELS</div>
          <p>
            Some horrible creatures, especially undead 몬스터, possess a fearsome supernatural ability to drain 레벨
            from those they strike in 전투. The creature making an 정령 흡수 공격 draws a portion of its victim’s life
            force from her. Most 정령 흡수 공격 require a successful melee 명중 굴림—mere physical contact is not
            enough. Each successful 정령 흡수 공격 bestows one or more negative 레벨 on the opponent. A creature takes
            the following 페널티 for each negative 레벨 it has gained.
          </p>
          <p>–1 on all 스킬 판정 and 능력 판정.</p>
          <p>–1 on 명중 굴림 and 내성 굴림.</p>
          <p>–5 히트 포인트.</p>
          <p>
            –1 effective 레벨(whenever the creature’s 레벨 is used in a die roll or calculation, reduce it by one for
            each negative 레벨).
          </p>
          <p>
            If the victim casts 주문, she loses access to one spell as if she had cast her highest-레벨, currently
            available spell. (If she has more than one spell at her highest 레벨, she chooses which she loses.) In
            addition, when she next prepares 주문 or regains spell slots, she gets one less spell slot at her highest
            spell 레벨.
          </p>
          <p>
            Negative 레벨 remain for 24 hours or until removed with a spell, such as
            <span style="font-style: italic">복원. </span>After 24 hours, the afflicted creature must attempt a
            Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 attacker’s HD + attacker’s Cha 수정치). (The DC is provided in the attacker’s
            묘사.) If 내성 굴림 succeeds, the negative 레벨 goes away with no 해악 to the creature. The afflicted
            creature makes a separate 내성 굴림 for each negative 레벨 it has gained. If the save fails, the negative
            레벨 goes away, but the creature’s 레벨 is also reduced by one.
          </p>
          <p>
            A character with negative 레벨 at least equal to her current 레벨, or drained below 1 레벨, is instantly
            slain. Depending on the creature that killed her, she may rise the next night as a monster of that kind. If
            not, she rises as a 시귀. A creature gains 5 임시 히트 포인트 for each negative 레벨 it bestows (though not
            if the negative 레벨 is caused by a spell or similar effect).

          <h3>에테리얼화</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">ETHEREALNESS</div>
          <p>
            위상 거미 and certain other creatures can exist on 에테리얼 세계. While on 에테리얼 세계, a creature is
            called ethereal. Unlike incorporeal creatures, ethereal creatures are not present on 물질 세계.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ethereal creatures are invisible, inaudible, insubstantial, and scentless to creatures on 물질 세계. Even
            most magical 공격 have no effect on them. <span style="font-style: italic">투명상태 보기 </span>and
            <span style="font-style: italic">진실의 시야 </span>reveal ethereal creatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            An ethereal creature can see and hear into 물질 세계 in a 60-foot radius, though material objects still
            block sight and sound. (An ethereal creature can’t see through a material wall, for instance.) An ethereal
            creature inside an object on 물질 세계 cannot see. Things on 물질 세계, however, look gray, indistinct, and
            ghostly. An ethereal creature can’t affect 물질 세계, not even magically. An ethereal creature, however,
            interacts with other ethereal creatures and objects the way material creatures interact with material
            creatures and objects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if a creature on 물질 세계 can see an ethereal creature the ethereal creature is on another plane. Only
            force effects can affect the ethereal creatures. If, on the other hand, both creatures are ethereal, they
            can affect each other normally.
          </p>
          <p>
            A force effect originating on 물질 세계 extends onto 에테리얼 세계, so that a
            <span style="font-style: italic">힘의 장벽 </span>blocks an ethereal creature, and a
            <span style="font-style: italic">마법 화살 </span>can strike one (provided the spellcaster can see the
            ethereal target). Gaze effects and 회피술 also extend from 물질 세계 to 에테리얼 세계. None of these effects
            extend from 에테리얼 세계 to 물질 세계.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ethereal creatures 이동 in any direction (including up or down) at will. They do not need to walk on the
            ground, and material objects don’t block them (though they can’t see while their eyes are within solid
            material).
          </p>
          <p>
            유령 have a power called manifestation that allows them to appear on 물질 세계 as incorporeal creatures.
            Still, they are on 에테리얼 세계, and another ethereal creature can interact normally with a manifesting
            유령. Ethereal creatures pass through and operate in water as easily as air. Ethereal creatures do not fall
            or take 낙하 피해.

          <div class="original-headline">EVASION AND IMPROVED EVASION</div>
          <p>
            These extraordinary 능력 allow the target of an 범위 공격 to leap or twist out of the way. 도적 and 수도사
            have 회피와 향상된 회피 as 직업 특성, but certain other creatures have these 능력, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            If subjected to an 공격 that allows a Reflex save for half 피해, a character with evasion takes no 피해 on a
            successful save.
          </p>
          <p>
            As with a Reflex save for any creature, a character must have room to 이동 in order to evade. A bound
            character or one squeezing through an 범위 cannot use evasion.
          </p>
          <p>
            As with a Reflex save for any creature, evasion is a reflexive ability. The character need not know that the
            공격 is coming to use evasion.
          </p>
          <p>
            도적 and 수도사 cannot use evasion in medium or heavy 갑옷. Some creatures with the evasion ability as an
            innate quality do not have this limitation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Improved evasion is like evasion, except that even on a failed 내성 굴림 the character takes only half 피해.

            through solid matter. Gaseous creatures can’t 공격 physically or cast 주문 with verbal, somatic, material,

            While 메두사’s gaze is well known, 시선 공격 can also charm, curse, or even kill. 시선 공격 not produced
            by a spell are supernatural.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each character within 거리 of a gaze 공격 must attempt a 내성 굴림(which can be a Fortitude or Will save)
            each round at the beginning of his turn.
          </p>
          <p>
            An opponent can avert his eyes from the creature’s face, looking at the creature’s body, watching its 어둠,
            or tracking the creature in a reflective surface. Each round, the opponent has a 50% chance of not having to
            make a 내성 굴림. The creature with the gaze 공격 gains 은폐 relative to the opponent. An opponent can shut
            his eyes, turn his back on the creature, or wear a blindfold. In these cases, the opponent does not need to
            make a 내성 굴림. The creature with the gaze 공격 gains total 은폐 relative to the opponent.
          </p>
          <p>
            A creature with a gaze 공격 can actively attempt to use its gaze as an 공격 action. The creature simply
            chooses a target within 거리, and that opponent must attempt a 내성 굴림. If the target has chosen to defend
            against the gaze as discussed above, the opponent gets a chance to avoid 내성 굴림(either 50% chance
            for averting eyes or 100% chance for shutting eyes). It is possible for an opponent to save against a
            creature’s gaze twice during the same round, once before its own action and once during the creature’s
            action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking at the creature’s image (such as in a mirror or as part of an 환영술) does not subject the viewer to
            a gaze 공격.
          </p>
          <p>A creature is immune to its own gaze 공격.</p>
          <p>
            If visibility is limited (by dim lighting, a 안개, or the like) so that it results in 은폐, there is a
            percentage chance equal to the normal miss chance for that degree of 은폐 that a character won’t need to
            make a 내성 굴림 in a given round. This chance is not cumulative with the chance for averting your eyes, but
            is rolled separately.

            영혼, 망령, and a few other creatures lack physical bodies. Such creatures are insubstantial and can’t be
            touched by nonmagical matter or energy. Likewise, they cannot manipulate objects or exert physical force on
            objects. However, incorporeal beings have a tangible presence that sometimes seems like a physical 공격
            against a corporeal creature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Incorporeal creatures are present on the same plane as the characters, and characters have some chance to
            affect them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Incorporeal creatures can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, by 마법 무기, or by 주문,
            spell-like effects, or supernatural effects. They are immune to all nonmagical 공격 forms. They are not
            burned by normal fires, affected by natural cold, or harmed by mundane acids.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even when struck by magic or 마법 무기, an incorporeal creature has a 50% chance to ignore any 피해 from a
            corporeal source—except for a force effector 피해 dealt by a 유령 touch weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Incorporeal creatures are immune to critical hits, extra 피해 from being favored enemies, and from sneak
            공격. They 이동 in any direction (including up or down) at will. They do not need to walk on the ground.
            They can pass through solid objects at will, although they cannot see when their eyes are within solid
            matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Incorporeal creatures hiding inside solid objects get a +2 circumstance 보너스 on 듣기 checks, because solid
            objects carry sound well. Pinpointing an opponent from inside a solid object uses the same rules as

            투명화 does not, by itself, make a creature immune to critical hits, but it does make the creature immune to

          <p>
            A creature can generally notice the presence of an active invisible creature within 30 feet with a DC 20
            감지 check. The observer gains a hunch that “something’s there” but can’t see it or target it accurately
            with an 공격. A creature who is holding still is very hard to notice (DC 30). An inanimate object, an
            unliving creature holding still, or a completely immobile creature is even harder to 감지(DC 40). It’s
            practically impossible (+20 DC) to pinpoint an invisible creature’s location with a 감지 check, and even if
            a character succeeds on such a check, the invisible creature still benefits from total 은폐(50% miss
            chance).

            A creature can use hearing to find an invisible creature. A character can make a 듣기 check for this 목적 as
            a free action each round. A 듣기 check result at least equal to the invisible creature’s 조용히 이동 check
            result reveals its presence. (A creature with no ranks in 조용히 이동 makes a 조용히 이동 check as a 민첩
            check to which an 갑옷 check 페널티 applies.) A successful check lets a character hear an invisible
            creature “over there somewhere.” It’s practically impossible to pinpoint the location of an invisible
            creature. A 듣기 check that beats the DC by 20 pinpoints the invisible creature’s location.

            A creature can grope about to find an invisible creature. A character can make a touch 공격 with his hands
            or a weapon into two adjacent 5-foot squares using a standard action. If an invisible target is in the
            designated 범위, there is a 50% miss chance on the touch 공격. If successful, the groping character deals no
            피해 but has successfully pinpointed the invisible creature’s current location. (If the invisible creature
            이동, its location, obviously, is once again unknown.)
          </p>
          <p>
            If an invisible creature strikes a character, the character struck still knows the location of the creature
            that struck him (until, of course, the invisible creature 이동). The only exception is if the invisible
            creature has a reach 상급 than 5 feet. In this case, the struck character knows the general location of the
            creature but has not pinpointed the exact location.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a character tries to 공격 an invisible creature whose location he has pinpointed, he 공격 normally, but
            the invisible creature still benefits from full 은폐(and thus a 50% miss chance). A particularly large and
            감속화 creature might get a smaller miss chance.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a character tries to 공격 an invisible creature whose location he has not pinpointed, have the player
            choose the space where the character will direct 공격. If the invisible creature is there, conduct the
            공격 normally. If the enemy’s not there, roll the miss chance as if it were there, don’t let the player see
            the result, and tell him that the character has missed. That way the player doesn’t know whether 공격
            missed because the enemy’s not there or because you successfully rolled the miss chance.
          </p>
          <p>
            If an invisible character picks up a visible object, the object remains visible. One could coat an invisible
            object with flour to at least keep 추적 of its position (until the flour fell off or blew away). An
            invisible creature can pick up a small visible item and 숨기 it on his person (tucked in a pocket or behind
            a cloak) and render it effectively invisible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Invisible creatures leave 추적. They can be tracked normally. Footprints in sand, mud, or other soft
            surfaces can give enemies clues to an invisible creature’s location.
          </p>

            An invisible creature in the water displaces water, revealing its location. The invisible creature, however,
            is still hard to see and benefits from 은폐.

          <p>A creature with 냄새 ability can detect an invisible creature as it would a visible one.</p>
          <p>
            A creature with 장님 전투 feat has a better chance to hit an invisible creature. Roll the miss chance
            twice, and he misses only if both rolls indicate a miss. (Alternatively, make one 25% miss chance roll
            rather than two 50% miss chance rolls.)

          <p>A creature with blindsight can 공격(and otherwise interact with) creatures regardless of 투명화.</p>

            An invisible burning torch still gives off 빛, as does an invisible object with a 빛 spell (or similar
            spell) cast upon it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ethereal creatures are invisible. Since ethereal creatures are not materially present, 감지 checks, 듣기
            checks, 냄새, 장님 전투, and blindsight don’t help locate them. Incorporeal creatures are often invisible.
            냄새, 장님 전투, and blindsight don’t help creatures find or 공격 invisible, incorporeal creatures, but 감지
            checks and possibly 듣기 checks can help.
          </p>
          <p>Invisible creatures cannot use 시선 공격.</p>
          <p>투명화 does not thwart <span style="font-style: italic">detect </span>주문.</p>
          <p>
            Since some creatures can detect or even see invisible creatures, it is helpful to be able to 숨기 even when
            invisible.

            A character who loses a 레벨 instantly loses one Hit Die. The character’s base 공격 보너스, base 내성 굴림

            ability score gain, skill ranks, and any feat associated with 레벨(if applicable). If the exact ability
            score or skill ranks increased from a 레벨 now lost is unknown (or the player has forgotten), lose 1 point
            from the highest ability score or ranks from the highest-ranked 스킬. If a familiar or companion creature
            has 능력 tied to a character who has lost a 레벨, the creature’s 능력 are adjusted to fit the character’s

            Some 몬스터 and 주문 have the supernatural or spell-like ability to paralyze their victims, immobilizing

            A paralyzed character cannot 이동, 말하기, or take any physical action. He is rooted to 감지, frozen and

          <h3>독</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">POISON</div>
          <p>
            When a character takes 피해 from an 공격 with a poisoned weapon, touches an item smeared with contact 독,
            consumes poisoned food or drink, or is otherwise poisoned, he must make a Fortitude 내성 굴림. If he fails,
            he takes 독’s initial 피해(usually ability 피해). Even if he succeeds, he typically faces more 피해 1
            minute later, which he can also avoid with a successful Fortitude 내성 굴림.
          </p>
          <p>
            One dose of 독 smeared on a weapon or some other object affects just a single target. A poisoned weapon or
            object retains its venom until the weapon scores a hit or the object is touched (unless 독 is wiped off
            before a target comes in contact with it). Any 독 smeared on an object or exposed to the elements in any way
            remains potent until it is touched or used.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although supernatural and spell-like 독 are possible, poisonous effects are almost always extraordinary.
          </p>
          <p>
            독 can be divided into four basic types according to the method by which their effect is delivered, as
            follows.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700">Contact:</span
            ><span>
              Merely touching this type of 독 necessitates a 내성 굴림. It can be actively delivered via a weapon or a
              touch 공격. Even if a creature has sufficient 피해 축소 to avoid taking any 피해 from 공격, 독 can
              still affect it. A chest or other object can be smeared with contact 독 as part of a trap.</span

          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700">Ingested:</span
            ><span>
              Ingested 독 are virtually impossible to utilize in a 전투 situation. A poisoner could administer a potion
              to an unconscious creature or attempt to dupe someone into drinking or eating something poisoned. 암살자
              and other characters tend to use ingested 독 outside of 전투.</span

            <span style="font-weight: 700">Inhaled:</span
            ><span>
              Inhaled 독 are usually contained in fragile vials or eggshells. They can be thrown as a ranged 공격 with a
              거리 increment of 10 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), the container releases its
              독. One dose spreads to fill the volume of a 10-foot cube. Each creature within 범위 must make a 내성
              굴림. (Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled 독; they affect the nasal membranes, tear
              ducts, and other parts of the body.)</span

          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700">Injury:</span
            ><span>
              This 독 must be delivered through a wound. If a creature has sufficient 피해 축소 to avoid taking any 피해
              from 공격, 독 does not affect it. 함정 that cause 피해 from 무기, needles, and the like sometimes
              contain injury 독.</span

              A character has a 5% chance of exposing himself to a 독 whenever he applies it to a weapon or otherwise
              readies it for use. Additionally, a character who rolls a natural 1 on an 명중 굴림 with a poisoned weapon

              Creatures with natural 독 공격 are immune to their own 독. Nonliving creatures (constructs and undead) and

              outsiders are also immune to 독, although conceivably special 독 could be concocted specifically to 해악
              them.

          <p>
            Magic can cause creatures and characters to change their shapes—sometimes against their will, but usually to
            gain an advantage. Polymorphed creatures retain their own minds but have new physical forms.
          </p>
          <p>The <span style="font-style: italic">변이 </span>spell defines the general 변이 effect.</p>
          <p>
            Since creatures do not change types, a slaying or 파멸 weapon designed to kill or 해악 creatures of a
            specific type affects those creatures even if they are polymorphed. Likewise, a creature polymorphed into
            the form of a creature of a different type is not subject to slaying and 파멸 effects directed at that type
            of creature.
          </p>
          <p>
            A 레인저’s favored enemy 보너스 is based on knowing what the foe is, so if a creature that is a 레인저’s
            favored enemy 변이 into another form, 레인저 is denied his 보너스.
          </p>
          <p>
            드워프 ’s 보너스 for fighting 거인 is based on shape and size, so he does not gain 보너스 against a 거인
            polymorphed into something else, but does gain 보너스 against any creature polymorphed into a 거인.

          <div class="original-headline">PSIONICS</div>
          <p>
            정신감응, mental 전투 and psychic powers—사이오닉 is a catchall word that describes special mental 능력
            possessed by various creatures. These are spell-like 능력 that a creature generates from the power of its
            mind alone—no other outside magical force or ritual is needed. Each psionic creature’s 묘사 contains details
            on its psionic 능력.
          </p>
          <p>
            Psionic 공격 almost always allow Will 내성 굴림 to resist them. However, not all psionic 공격 are mental
            공격. Some psionic 능력 allow the psionic creature to reshape its own body, 치료 its wounds, or 순간이동
            great distances. Some 사이오닉 생명체 can see into the future, the past, and the present (in far-off
            locales) as well as read the minds of others.

          <div class="original-headline">RAYS</div>
          <p>
            All ray 공격 require the attacker to make a successful ranged touch 공격 against the target. 광선 have
            varying 거리, which are simple maximums. A ray’s 명중 굴림 never takes a 거리 페널티. Even if a ray hits,
            it usually allows the target to make a 내성 굴림(Fortitude or Will). 광선 never allow a Reflex 내성 굴림,
            but if a character’s 민첩 보너스 to AC is high, it might be hard to hit her with the ray in the first place.

          <div class="original-headline">REGENERATION</div>
          <p>
            Creatures with this extraordinary ability recover from wounds quickly and can even regrow or reattach
            severed body parts. 피해 dealt to the creature is treated as 비치명적인 피해, and the creature automatically
            cures itself of 비치명적인 피해 at a fixed rate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certain 공격 forms, typically fire and acid, deal 피해 to the creature normally; that sort of 피해 doesn’t
            convert to 비치명적인 피해 and so doesn’t go away. The creature’s 묘사 includes the details.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creatures with 재생 can regrow lost portions of their bodies and can reattach severed limbs or body parts.
            Severed parts die if they are not reattached.
          </p>
          <p>재생 does not restore 히트 포인트 lost from starvation, thirst, or 질식.</p>

            An 공격 that can cause instant death only threatens the creature with death if it is delivered by 무기 that

          <h3>에너지 저항</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">RESISTANCE TO ENERGY</div>
          <p>
            A creature with 에너지 저항 has the ability (usually extraordinary) to ignore some 피해 of a certain type
            each round, but it does not have total immunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each 저항 ability is defined by what energy type it resists and how many points of 피해 are resisted. It
            doesn’t matter whether 피해 has a mundane or magical source.
          </p>
          <p>
            When 저항 completely negates 피해 from an energy 공격, 공격 does not disrupt a spell. This 저항 does
            not stack with 저항 that a spellmight provide.

          <h3>냄새</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">SCENT</div>
          <p>
            This extraordinary ability lets a creature detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and 추적 by
            sense of smell.
          </p>
          <p>
            A creature with 냄새 ability can detect opponents by sense of smell, generally within 30 feet. If the
            opponent is upwind, 거리 is 60 feet. If it is downwind, 거리 is 15 feet. Strong 냄새, such as smoke
            or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice 거리 noted above. Overpowering 냄새, such as skunk musk or
            트로글로다이트 stench, can be detected at three times these 거리.
          </p>
          <p>
            The creature detects another creature’s presence but not its specific location. Noting the direction of the
            냄새 is a 이동 action. If it 이동 within 5 feet of 냄새’s source, the creature can pinpoint that source.
          </p>
          <p>
            A creature with 추적 feat and 냄새 ability can follow 추적 by smell, making a 지혜 check to find or
            follow a 추적. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10. The DC increases or decreases depending on how strong
            the quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures, and 나이 of the trail. For each hour that the trail is
            cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for 추적 feat. Creatures tracking
            by 냄새 ignore the effects of surface 상태이상 and poor visibility.
          </p>
          <p>Creatures with 냄새 ability can 식별 familiar odors just as 인간 do familiar sights.</p>
          <p>
            Water, particularly running water, 파멸 a trail for air-breathing creatures. Water-breathing creatures that
            have 냄새 ability, however, can use it in the water easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            False, powerful odors can easily mask other 냄새. The presence of such an odor completely spoils the ability
            to properly detect or 식별 creatures, and the base 생존 DC to 추적 becomes 20 rather than 10.

          <div class="original-headline">SPELL RESISTANCE</div>
          <p>
            주문 저항 is the extraordinary ability to avoid being affected by 주문. (Some 주문 also grant 주문 저항.)
          </p>
          <p>
            To affect a creature that has 주문 저항, a spellcaster must make a 시전자 레벨 check (1d20 + 시전자 레벨) at
            least equal to the creature’s 주문 저항. (The defender’s 주문 저항 is like an 방어도 against magical 공격.)
            If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn’t affect the creature. The possessor does not have to do
            anything special to use 주문 저항. The creature need not even be aware of the threat for its 주문 저항 to
            operate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only 주문 and spell-like 능력 are subject to 주문 저항. Extraordinary and supernatural 능력(including
            enhancement 보너스 on 마법 무기) are not. A creature can have some 능력 that are subject to 주문 저항 and
            some that are not. Even some 주문 ignore 주문 저항; see 주문 저항이 적용되는 조건, below.
          </p>
          <p>
            A creature can voluntarily lower its 주문 저항. Doing so is a standard action that does not provoke an 공격
            of opportunity. Once a creature lowers its 저항, it remains down until the creature’s next turn. At the
            beginning of the creature’s next turn, the creature’s 주문 저항 automatically returns unless the creature
            intentionally keeps it down (also a standard action that does not provoke an 공격 of opportunity).
          </p>
          <p>A creature’s 주문 저항 never interferes with its own 주문, items, or 능력.</p>
          <p>
            A creature with 주문 저항 cannot impart this power to others by touching them or standing in their midst.
            Only the rarest of creatures and a few 마법 아이템 have the ability to bestow 주문 저항 upon another.
          </p>
          <p>주문 저항 does not stack. It overlaps.</p>

            <h4>주문 저항이 적용되는 조건</h4>
            <div class="original-headline">When Spell Resistance Applies</div>
            <p>
              Each spell includes an entry that indicates whether 주문 저항 applies to the spell. In general, whether
              주문 저항 applies depends on what the spell does:
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 700">Targeted 주문:</span
              ><span>
                주문 저항 applies if the spell is targeted at the creature. Some individually targeted 주문 can be
                directed at several creatures simultaneously. In such cases, a creature’s 주문 저항 applies only to the
                portion of the spell actually targeted at that creature. If several different resistant creatures are
                subjected to such a spell, each checks its 주문 저항 separately.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 700">범위 주문:</span
              ><span>
                주문 저항 applies if the resistant creature is within the spell’s 범위. It protects the resistant
                creature without affecting the spell itself.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 700">Effect 주문:</span
              ><span>
                Most effect 주문 summon or create something and are not subject to 주문 저항. Sometimes, however, 주문
                저항 applies to effect 주문, usually to those that act upon a creature more or less directly, such as
                <span style="font-style: italic">거미줄.</span></span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              주문 저항 can protect a creature from a spell that’s already been cast. Check 주문 저항 when the creature
              is first affected by the spell.
            </p>
            <p>
              Check 주문 저항 only once for any particular casting of a spell or use of a spell-like ability. If 주문
              저항 fails the first time, it fails each time the creature encounters that same casting of the spell.
              Likewise, if 주문 저항 succeeds the first time, it always succeeds. If the creature has voluntarily
              lowered its 주문 저항 and is then subjected to a spell, the creature still has a single chance to resist
              that spell later, when its 주문 저항 is up.
            </p>
            <p>
              주문 저항 has no effect unless the energy created or released by the spell actually goes to work on the
              resistant creature’s mind or body. If the spell acts on anything else and the creature is affected as a
              consequence, no roll is required. Creatures can be harmed by a spell without being directly affected.
            </p>
            <p>
              주문 저항 does not apply if an effect fools the creature’s senses or reveals something about the creature.
            </p>
            <p>
              Magic actually has to be working for 주문 저항 to apply. 주문 that have instantaneous 지속시간 but lasting
              results aren’t subject to 주문 저항 unless the resistant creature is exposed to the spell the instant it
              is cast.
            </p>
            <p>When in doubt about whether a spell’s effect is direct or indirect, consider the spell’s 학파:</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 700">회피술:</span
              ><span>
                The target creature must be harmed, changed, or restricted in some manner for 주문 저항 to apply.
                Perception changes aren’t subject to 주문 저항.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              회피술 that block or negate 공격 are not subject to an attacker’s 주문 저항—it is the protected creature
              that is affected by the spell (becoming immune or resistant to 공격).

                  >. </span
                >주문 that summon creatures or produce effects that function like creatures are not subject to 주문

              ><span>
                These 주문 do not affect creatures directly and are not subject to 주문 저항, even though what they
                reveal about a creature might be very damaging.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 700">부여술:</span
              ><span> Since 부여술 주문 affect creatures’ minds, they are typically subject to 주문 저항.</span>

              <span style="font-weight: 700">강신술:</span
              ><span>
                If an 강신술 spell deals 피해 to the creature, it has a direct effect. If the spell 피해 something else,
                it has an indirect effect.</span

              ><span>
                Most of these 주문 alter the target creature’s life force and are subject to 주문 저항. Unusual 강령술
                주문 that don’t affect other creatures directly are not subject to 주문 저항.</span

            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 700">변환술:</span
              ><span>
                These 주문 are subject to 주문 저항 if they transform the target creature. 변환술 주문 are not subject
                to 주문 저항 if they are targeted on a point in space instead of on a creature. Some 변환술 make objects
                harmful (or more harmful), such as <span style="font-style: italic">마법의 돌</span>. Even these 주문
                are not generally subject to 주문 저항 because they affect the objects, not the creatures against which
                the objects are used. 주문 저항 works against <span style="font-style: italic">마법의 돌 </span>only if
                the creature with 주문 저항 is holding the stones when 사제 casts
                <span style="font-style: italic">마법의 돌 </span>on them.

            <h4>주문 저항의 성공</h4>
            <div class="original-headline">Successful Spell Resistance</div>
            <p>
              주문 저항 prevents a spell or a spell-like ability from affecting or harming the resistant creature, but
              it never removes a magical effect from another creature or negates a spell’s effect on another creature.
              주문 저항 prevents a spell from disrupting another spell.
            </p>
            <p>
              Against an ongoing spell that has already been cast, a failed check against 주문 저항 allows the resistant
              creature to ignore any effect the spell might have. The magic continues to affect others normally.

            A 죽어가고 있음 character is unconscious and near death. She has –1 to –9 current 히트 포인트. A 죽어가고
            있음 character can take no actions and is unconscious. At the end of each round (starting with the round in
            which the character dropped below 0 히트 포인트), the character rolls d% to see whether she becomes stable.
            She has a 10% chance to become stable. If she does not, she loses 1 hit point. If a 죽어가고 있음 character
            reaches –10 히트 포인트, she is 죽음.</span

          <span style="font-weight: 700">Energy Drained:</span

            The character gains one or more negative 레벨, which might permanently drain the character’s 레벨. If the
            subject has at least as many negative 레벨 as 히트 다이스, he dies. Each negative 레벨 gives a creature the
            following 페널티: –1 페널티 on 명중 굴림, 내성 굴림, 스킬 판정, 능력 판정; loss of 5 히트 포인트; and –1
            to effective 레벨(for determining the power, 지속시간, DC, and other details of 주문 or 특수 능력). In
            addition, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from the highest spell 레벨 castable.</span

            The character is ensnared. Being entangled impedes 이동, but does not entirely prevent it unless the bonds
            are anchored to an immobile object or tethered by an opposing force. An entangled creature 이동 at half
            속도, cannot 달리기 or 돌격, and takes a –2 페널티 on all 명중 굴림 and a –4 페널티 to 민첩. An entangled
            character who attempts to 주문 시전 must make a 집중 check (DC 15 + the spell’s 레벨) or lose the spell.

            An exhausted character 이동 at half 속도 and takes a –6 페널티 to 근력 and 민첩. After 1 hour of complete
            rest, an exhausted character becomes fatigued. A fatigued character becomes exhausted by doing something
            else that would normally cause fatigue.</span

            >A fascinated creature is entranced by a supernatural or spell effect. The creature stands or sits quietly,
            taking no actions other than to pay attention to the fascinating effect, for as long as the effect lasts. It
            takes a –4 페널티 on 스킬 판정 made as reactions, such as 듣기 and 감지 checks. Any potential threat, such
            as a hostile creature approaching, allows the fascinated creature a new 내성 굴림 against the fascinating
            effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at
            the fascinated creature, automatically breaks the effect. A fascinated creature’s ally may shake it free of
            the spell as a standard action.

            A fatigued character can neither 달리기 nor 돌격 and takes a –2 페널티 to 근력 and 민첩. Doing anything
            that would normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued character to become exhausted. After 8 hours of
            complete rest, fatigued characters are no longer fatigued.

          <span style="font-weight: 700">Flat-Footed:</span
          ><span>
            A character who has not yet acted during a 전투 I flat-footed, not yet reacting normally to the situation. A
            flat-footed character loses his 민첩 보너스 to AC (if any) and cannot make 기회 공격.

          <span style="font-weight: 700">Frightened:</span
          ><span>
            A frightened creature flees from the source of its 공포 as best it can. If unable to flee, it may fight. A
            frightened creature takes a –2 페널티 on all 명중 굴림, 내성 굴림, 스킬 판정, and 능력 판정. A frightened
            creature can use 특수 능력, including 주문, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are
            the only way to escape.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Frightened is like shaken, except that the creature must flee if possible. Panicked is a more extreme state of
          공포.

            Engaged in wrestling or some other form of hand-to-hand struggle with one or more attackers. A grappling
            character can undertake only a limited number of actions. He does not threaten any squares, and loses his
            민첩 보너스 to AC (if any) against opponents he isn’t grappling.</span

          <span style="font-weight: 700">Helpless:</span

            A helpless character is paralyzed, <span style="font-style: italic">held</span>, bound, sleeping,
            unconscious, or otherwise completely at an opponent’s mercy. A helpless target is treated as having a 민첩
            of 0 (–5 수정치). Melee 공격 against a helpless target get a +4 보너스(equivalent to attacking a prone
            target). Ranged 공격 gets no special 보너스 against helpless targets. 도적 can sneak 공격 helpless targets.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          As a full-round action, an enemy can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless foe. An enemy
          can also use a bow or crossbow, provided he is adjacent to the target. The attacker automatically hits and
          scores a critical hit. (A 도적 also gets her sneak 공격 피해 보너스 against a helpless foe when delivering a
          coup de grace.) If the defender survives, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 피해 dealt) or die.
        </p>
        <p>Delivering a coup de grace provokes 기회 공격.</p>
        <p>
          Creatures that are immune to critical hits do not take critical 피해, nor do they need to make Fortitude 내성
          굴림 to avoid being killed by a coup de grace.

            Depending on their size, creatures can be knocked down by 바람 of high velocity. Creatures on the ground are

            Experiencing stomach distress. Nauseated creatures are unable to 공격, cast 주문, concentrate on 주문, or do

            cowers and does not 공격, typically using 총력 방어 action in 전투. A panicked creature can use 특수
            능력, including 주문, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to

            air at the time that it becomes paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A paralyzed swimmer can’t 수영
            and may drown. A creature can 이동 through a space occupied by a paralyzed creature—ally or not. Each square
            occupied by a paralyzed creature, however, counts as 2 squares.</span

            A petrified character has been turned to stone and is considered unconscious. If a petrified character
            cracks or breaks, but the broken pieces are joined with the body as he returns to flesh, he is unharmed. If
            the character’s petrified body is incomplete when it returns to flesh, the body is likewise incomplete and
