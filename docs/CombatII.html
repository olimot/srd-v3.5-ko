30mm tall.

Your speed while unarmored is your base land speed.</p><p><strong title="Encumbrance:">과적상태:</strong> A character encumbered by carrying a large amount of gear, treasure, or fallen comrades may move slower than normal.</p><p><strong title="Hampered Movement:">험난한 이동:</strong> Difficult terrain, obstacles, or poor visibility can hamper movement.</p><p><strong title="Movement in Combat:">전투 중 이동:</strong> Generally, you can move your speed in a round and still do something (take a move action and a standard action).</p><p>If you do nothing but move (that is, if you use both of your actions in a round to move your speed), you can move double your speed.</p><p>If you spend the entire round running, you can move quadruple your speed. If you do something that requires a full round you can only take a 5-foot step.</p><p><strong title="Bonuses to Speed:">속도 보너스:</strong> A barbarian has a +10 foot bonus to his speed (unless he’s wearing heavy armor). Experienced monks also have higher speed (unless they’re wearing armor of any sort). In addition, many spells and magic items can affect a character’s speed. Always apply any modifiers to a character’s speed before adjusting the character’s speed based on armor or encumbrance, and remember that multiple bonuses of the same type to a character’s speed don’t stack.</p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><th title="Table: Tactical Speed">Table: Tactical 속도</th><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><th title="Race">종족 </th><th title="No Armor or Light Armor">No 갑옷 or 빛 갑옷</th><th title="Medium or Heavy Armor">중간 or Heavy 갑옷</th></tr><tr><td>Human, elf, half-elf, half-orc</td><td>30 ft.(6 squares)</td><td>20 ft.(4 squares)</td></tr><tr><td>Dwarf</td><td>20 ft.(4 squares)</td><td>20 ft.(4 squares)</td></tr><tr><td>Halfling, gnome</td><td>20 ft.(4 squares)</td><td>15 ft.(3 squares)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id="h5-4-measuring-distance"><h5 title="Measuring Distance">거리 측정</h5><p><strong title="Diagonals:">대각선:</strong> When measuring distance, the first diagonal counts as 1 square, the second counts as 2 squares, the third counts as 1, the fourth as 2, and so on.</p><p>You can’t move diagonally past a corner (even by taking a 5-foot step). You can move diagonally past a creature, even an opponent.</p><p>You can also move diagonally past other impassable obstacles, such as pits.</p><p><strong title="Closest Creature:">가장 가까운 생명체:</strong> When it’s important to determine the closest square or creature to a location, if two squares or creatures are equally close, randomly determine which one counts as closest by rolling a die.</p></section><section id="h5-5-moving-through-a-square"><h5 title="Moving through a Square">한 정사각형 이동</h5><p><strong title="Friend:">친구:</strong> You can move through a square occupied by a friendly character, unless you are charging. When you move through a square occupied by a friendly character, that character doesn’t provide you with cover.</p><p><strong title="Opponent:">상대방:</strong> You can’t move through a square occupied by an opponent, unless the opponent is helpless. You can move through a square occupied by a helpless opponent without penalty. (Some creatures, particularly very large ones, may present an obstacle even when helpless. In such cases, each square you move through counts as 2 squares.)</p><p><strong title="Ending Your Movement:">이동 마치기:</strong> You can’t end your movement in the same square as another creature unless it is helpless.</p><p><strong title="Overrun:">쇄도:</strong> During your movement you can attempt to move through a square occupied by an opponent.</p><p><strong title="Tumbling:">재주넘기:</strong> A trained character can attempt to tumble through a square occupied by an opponent (see the Tumble skill).</p><p><strong title="Very Small Creature:">아주 작은 생명체:</strong> A Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creature can move into or through an occupied square. The creature provokes attacks of opportunity when doing so.</p><p><strong title="Square Occupied by Creature Three Sizes Larger or Smaller:">세 사이즈 이상 차이나는 생명체가 차지한 칸:</strong> Any creature can move through a square occupied by a creature three size categories larger than it is.</p><p>A big creature can move through a square occupied by a creature three size categories smaller than it is.</p><p><strong title="Designated Exceptions:">정해진 예외:</strong> Some creatures break the above rules. A creature that completely fills the squares it occupies cannot be moved past, even with the Tumble skill or similar special abilities.</p></section><section id="h5-6-terrain-and-obstacles"><h5 title="Terrain and Obstacles">지형과 장애물</h5><p><strong title="Difficult Terrain:">험한 지형:</strong> Difficult terrain hampers movement. Each square of difficult terrain counts as 2 squares of movement. (Each diagonal move into a difficult terrain square counts as 3 squares.) You can’t run or charge across difficult terrain.</p><p>If you occupy squares with different kinds of terrain, you can move only as fast as the most difficult terrain you occupy will allow.</p><p>Flying and incorporeal creatures are not hampered by difficult terrain.</p><p><strong title="Obstacles:">장애물:</strong> Like difficult terrain, obstacles can hamper movement. If an obstacle hampers movement but doesn’t completely block it each obstructed square or obstacle between squares counts as 2 squares of movement. You must pay this cost to cross the barrier, in addition to the cost to move into the square on the other side. If you don’t have sufficient movement to cross the barrier and move into the square on the other side, you can’t cross the barrier. Some obstacles may also require a skill check to cross.</p><p>On the other hand, some obstacles block movement entirely. A character can’t move through a blocking obstacle.</p><p>Flying and incorporeal creatures can avoid most obstacles</p><p><strong title="Squeezing:">끼어서 이동:</strong> In some cases, you may have to squeeze into or through an area that isn’t as wide as the space you take up. You can squeeze through or into a space that is at least half as wide as your normal space. Each move into or through a narrow space counts as if it were 2 squares, and while squeezed in a narrow space you take a –4 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty to AC.</p><p>When a Large creature (which normally takes up four squares) squeezes into a space that’s one square wide, the creature’s miniature figure occupies two squares, centered on the line between the two squares. For a bigger creature, center the creature likewise in the area it squeezes into.</p><p>A creature can squeeze past an opponent while moving but it can’t end its movement in an occupied square.</p><p>To squeeze through or into a space less than half your space’s width, you must use the Escape Artist skill. You can’t attack while using Escape Artist to squeeze through or into a narrow space, you take a –4 penalty to AC, and you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.</p></section><section id="h5-7-special-movement-rules"><h5 title="Special Movement Rules">특수 이동 규칙</h5><p>These rules cover special movement situations.</p><p><strong title="Accidentally Ending Movement in an Illegal Space:">갑자기 규칙상 잘못된 공간에서 이동이 끝난 경우:</strong> Sometimes a character ends its movement while moving through a space where it’s not allowed to stop. When that happens, put your miniature in the last legal position you occupied, or the closest legal position, if there’s a legal position that’s closer.</p><p><strong title="Double Movement Cost:">두배 이동 비용:</strong> When your movement is hampered in some way, your movement usually costs double. For example, each square of movement through difficult terrain counts as 2 squares, and each diagonal move through such terrain counts as 3 squares (just as two diagonal moves normally do).</p><p>If movement cost is doubled twice, then each square counts as 4 squares (or as 6 squares if moving diagonally). If movement cost is doubled three times, then each square counts as 8 squares (12 if diagonal) and so on. This is an exception to the general rule that two doublings are equivalent to a tripling.</p><p><strong title="Minimum Movement:">최소 이동:</strong> Despite penalties to movement, you can take a full-round action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any direction, even diagonally. (This rule doesn’t allow you to move through impassable terrain or to move when all movement is prohibited.) Such movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal (despite the distance covered, this move isn’t a 5-foot step).</p></section></section><section id="h2-8-big-and-little-creatures-in-combat"><h2 title="BIG AND LITTLE CREATURES IN COMBAT">크거나 작은 생명체의 전투</h2><p>Creatures smaller than Small or larger than Medium have special rules relating to position. </p><p><strong title="Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine Creatures:">특소형, 소형, 중형 생명체:</strong> Very small creatures take up less than 1 square of space. This means that more than one such creature can fit into a single square. A Tiny creature typically occupies a space only 2-1/2 feet across, so four can fit into a single square. Twenty-five Diminutive creatures or 100 Fine creatures can fit into a single square. Creatures that take up less than 1 square of space typically have a natural reach of 0 feet, meaning they can’t reach into adjacent squares. They must enter an opponent’s square to attack in melee. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the opponent. You can attack into your own square if you need to, so you can attack such creatures normally. Since they have no natural reach, they do not threaten the squares around them. You can move past them without provoking attacks of opportunity. They also can’t flank an enemy.</p><p><strong title="Large, Huge, Gargantuan, and Colossal Creatures:">대형, 특대형, 거대형, 초대형 생명체:</strong> Very large creatures take up more than 1 square.</p><p>Creatures that take up more than 1 square typically have a natural reach of 10 feet or more, meaning that they can reach targets even if they aren’t in adjacent squares.</p><p>Unlike when someone uses a reach weapon, a creature with greater than normal natural reach (more than 5 feet) still threatens squares adjacent to it. A creature with greater than normal natural reach usually gets an attack of opportunity against you if you approach it, because you must enter and move within the range of its reach before you can attack it. (This attack of opportunity is not provoked if you take a 5-foot step.)</p><p>Large or larger creatures using reach weapons can strike up to double their natural reach but can’t strike at their natural reach or less. </p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><th style="min-width: 14.775em;" title="Table: Creature Size and Scale">Table: 생명체 크기 및 Scale</th><td style="min-width: 4.425em;"></td><td style="min-width: 8.325em;"></td></tr><tr><th title="Creature Size">생명체 크기</th><th title="Space1">Space<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></th><th title="Natural Reach1">Natural Reach<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></th></tr><tr><td>Fine</td><td>1/2 ft.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Diminutive</td><td>1 ft.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Tiny</td><td>2-1/2 ft.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>5 ft.</td><td>5 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>5 ft.</td><td>5 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Large (tall)</td><td>10 ft.</td><td>10 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Large (long)</td><td>10 ft.</td><td>5 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Huge (tall)</td><td>15 ft.</td><td>15 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Huge (long)</td><td>15 ft.</td><td>10 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan (tall)</td><td>20 ft.</td><td>20 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan (long)</td><td>20 ft.</td><td>15 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal (tall)</td><td>30 ft.</td><td>30 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal (long)</td><td>30 ft.</td><td>20 ft.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">1 These values are typical for creatures of the indicated size.

When making a melee attack against a target that isn’t adjacent to you (such as with a reach weapon), use the rules for determining cover from ranged attacks.</p><p><strong title="Low Obstacles and Cover:">낮은 장애물 및 엄폐:</strong> A low obstacle (such as a wall no higher than half your height) provides cover, but only to creatures within 30 feet (6 squares) of it. The attacker can ignore the cover if he’s closer to the obstacle than his target.</p><p><strong title="Cover and Attacks of Opportunity:">엄폐 및 기회 공격:</strong> You can’t execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with cover relative to you.</p><p><strong title="Cover and Reflex Saves:">엄폐 및 반사 내성 굴림:</strong> Cover grants you a +2 bonus on Reflex saves against attacks that originate or burst out from a point on the other side of the cover from you. Note that spread effects can extend around corners and thus negate this cover bonus.</p><p><strong title="Cover and Hide Checks:">엄폐 및 숨기 판정:</strong> You can use cover to make a Hide check. Without cover, you usually need concealment (see below) to make a Hide check.</p><p><strong title="Soft Cover:">부드러운 엄폐물:</strong> Creatures, even your enemies, can provide you with cover against ranged attacks, giving you a +4 bonus to AC. However, such soft cover provides no bonus on Reflex saves, nor does soft cover allow you to make a Hide check.</p><p><strong title="Big Creatures and Cover:">큰 생명체와 엄폐:</strong> Any creature with a space larger than 5 feet (1 square) determines cover against melee attacks slightly differently than smaller creatures do. Such a creature can choose any square that it occupies to determine if an opponent has cover against its melee attacks. Similarly, when making a melee attack against such a creature, you can pick any of the squares it occupies to determine if it has cover against you.</p><p><strong title="Total Cover:">전체 엄폐:</strong> If you don’t have line of effect to your target he is considered to have total cover from you. You can’t make an attack against a target that has total cover.</p><p><strong title="Varying Degrees of Cover:">다양한 엄폐의 정도:</strong> In some cases, cover may provide a greater bonus to AC and Reflex saves. In such situations the normal cover bonuses to AC and Reflex saves can be doubled (to +8 and +4, respectively). A creature with this improved cover effectively gains improved evasion against any attack to which the Reflex save bonus applies. Furthermore, improved cover provides a +10 bonus on Hide checks.</p></section><section id="h2-12-concealment"><h2 title="CONCEALMENT">은폐</h2><p>To determine whether your target has concealment from your ranged attack, choose a corner of your square. If any line from this corner to any corner of the target’s square passes through a square or border that provides concealment, the target has concealment.</p><p>When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your target has concealment if his space is entirely within an effect that grants concealment. When making a melee attack against a target that isn’t adjacent to you use the rules for determining concealment from ranged attacks.</p><p>In addition, some magical effects provide concealment against all attacks, regardless of whether any intervening concealment exists.</p><p><strong title="Concealment Miss Chance:">은폐 미스 기회:</strong> Concealment gives the subject of a successful attack a 20% chance that the attacker missed because of the concealment. If the attacker hits, the defender must make a miss chance percentile roll to avoid being struck. Multiple concealment conditions do not stack.</p><p><strong title="Concealment and Hide Checks:">은폐 및 숨기 판정:</strong> You can use concealment to make a Hide check. Without concealment, you usually need cover to make a Hide check.</p><p><strong title="Total Concealment:">전체 은폐:</strong> If you have line of effect to a target but not line of sight he is considered to have total concealment from you. You can’t attack an opponent that has total concealment, though you can attack into a square that you think he occupies. A successful attack into a square occupied by an enemy with total concealment has a 50% miss chance (instead of the normal 20% miss chance for an opponent with concealment).</p><p>You can’t execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with total concealment, even if you know what square or squares the opponent occupies.</p><p><strong title="Ignoring Concealment:">은폐 무시:</strong> Concealment isn’t always effective. A shadowy area or darkness doesn’t provide any concealment against an opponent with darkvision. Characters with low-light vision can see clearly for a greater distance with the same light source than other characters. Although invisibility provides total concealment, sighted opponents may still make Spot checks to notice the location of an invisible character. An invisible character gains a +20 bonus on Hide checks if moving, or a +40 bonus on Hide checks when not moving (even though opponents can’t see you, they might be able to figure out where you are from other visual clues).</p><p><strong title="Varying Degrees of Concealment:">다양한 은폐의 정도:</strong> Certain situations may provide more or less than typical concealment, and modify the miss chance accordingly.</p></section><section id="h2-13-flanking"><h2 title="FLANKING">협공</h2><p>When making a melee attack, you get a +2 flanking bonus if your opponent is threatened by a character or creature friendly to you on the opponent’s opposite border or opposite corner.</p><p>When in doubt about whether two friendly characters flank an opponent in the middle, trace an imaginary line between the two friendly characters’ centers. If the line passes through opposite borders of the opponent’s space (including corners of those borders), then the opponent is flanked.</p><p><em title="Exception:">예외:</em> If a flanker takes up more than 1 square, it gets the flanking bonus if any square it occupies counts for flanking.</p><p>Only a creature or character that threatens the defender can help an attacker get a flanking bonus.</p><p>Creatures with a reach of 0 feet can’t flank an opponent.</p></section><section id="h2-14-helpless-defenders"><h2 title="HELPLESS DEFENDERS">무력화 상태의 상대방</h2><p>A helpless opponent is someone who is bound, sleeping, paralyzed, unconscious, or otherwise at your mercy.</p><p><strong title="Regular Attack:">일반 공격:</strong> A helpless character takes a –4 penalty to AC against melee attacks, but no penalty to AC against ranged attacks.</p><p>A helpless defender can’t use any Dexterity bonus to AC.

If the defender survives the damage, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. A rogue also gets her extra sneak attack damage against a helpless opponent when delivering a coup de grace.</p><p>Delivering a coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents.</p><p>You can’t deliver a coup de grace against a creature that is immune to critical hits.

You can only bull rush an opponent who is one size category larger than you, the same size, or smaller.</p><p><strong title="Initiating a Bull Rush:">황소 쇄도 시작:</strong> First, you move into the defender’s space. Doing this provokes an attack of opportunity from each opponent that threatens you, including the defender. (If you have the Improved Bull Rush feat, you don’t provoke an attack of opportunity from the defender.) Any attack of opportunity made by anyone other than the defender against you during a bull rush has a 25% chance of accidentally targeting the defender instead, and any attack of opportunity by anyone other than you against the defender likewise has a 25% chance of accidentally targeting you. (When someone makes an attack of opportunity, make the attack roll and then roll to see whether the attack went astray.) </p><p>Second, you and the defender make opposed Strength checks. You each add a +4 bonus for each size category you are larger than Medium or a –4 penalty for each size category you are smaller than Medium. You get a +2 bonus if you are charging. The defender gets a +4 bonus if he has more than two legs or is otherwise exceptionally stable.</p><p><strong title="Bull Rush Results:">황소 쇄도 결과:</strong> If you beat the defender’s Strength check result, you push him back 5 feet. If you wish to move with the defender, you can push him back an additional 5 feet for each 5 points by which your check result is greater than the defender’s check result. You can’t, however, exceed your normal movement limit. (<i>Note:</i> The defender provokes attacks of opportunity if he is moved. So do you, if you move with him. The two of you do not provoke attacks of opportunity from each other, however.)</p><p>If you fail to beat the defender’s Strength check result, you move 5 feet straight back to where you were before you moved into his space.

You must move at least 10 feet (2 squares) and may move up to double your speed directly toward the designated opponent.</p><p>You must have a clear path toward the opponent, and nothing can hinder your movement (such as difficult terrain or obstacles). Here’s what it means to have a clear path. First, you must move to the closest space from which you can attack the opponent. (If this space is occupied or otherwise blocked, you can’t charge.) Second, if any line from your starting space to the ending space passes through a square that blocks movement, slows movement, or contains a creature (even an ally), you can’t charge. (Helpless creatures don’t stop a charge.)</p><p>If you don’t have line of sight to the opponent at the start of your turn, you can’t charge that opponent.</p><p>You can’t take a 5-foot step in the same round as a charge.</p><p>If you are able to take only a standard action or a move action on your turn, you can still charge, but you are only allowed to move up to your speed (instead of up to double your speed).

You provoke an attack of opportunity from the target you are trying to disarm. (If you have the Improved Disarm feat, you don’t incur an attack of opportunity for making a disarm attempt.) If the defender’s attack of opportunity deals any damage, your disarm attempt fails.</p><p><strong title="Step 2:">스텝 2:</strong> Opposed Rolls. You and the defender make opposed attack rolls with your respective weapons. The wielder of a two-handed weapon on a disarm attempt gets a +4 bonus on this roll, and the wielder of a light weapon takes a –4 penalty. (An unarmed strike is considered a light weapon, so you always take a penalty when trying to disarm an opponent by using an unarmed strike.) If the combatants are of different sizes, the larger combatant gets a bonus on the attack roll of +4 per difference in size category. If the targeted item isn’t a melee weapon, the defender takes a –4 penalty on the roll.</p><p><strong title="Step Three:">스텝 3:</strong> Consequences. If you beat the defender, the defender is disarmed. If you attempted the disarm action unarmed, you now have the weapon. If you were armed, the defender’s weapon is on the ground in the defender’s square.</p><p>If you fail on the disarm attempt, the defender may immediately react and attempt to disarm you with the same sort of opposed melee attack roll. His attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from you. If he fails his disarm attempt, you do not subsequently get a free disarm attempt against him.</p><p><em title="Note:">비고:</em> A defender wearing spiked gauntlets can’t be disarmed.

Unlike on a normal disarm attempt, failing the attempt doesn’t allow the defender to attempt to disarm you. This otherwise functions identically to a disarm attempt, as noted above.</p><p>You can’t snatch an item that is well secured unless you have pinned the wearer (see Grapple).

This attack must be made on or before your next turn.</p><p>When feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid you take a –4 penalty.

If the mount is running (quadruple speed), you can cast a spell when your mount has moved up to twice its speed, but your Concentration check is more difficult due to the violent motion (DC 15 + spell level).</p><p><strong title="If Your Mount Falls in Battle:">탈것이 전투 중 쓰러진 경우:</strong> If your mount falls, you have to succeed on a DC 15 Ride check to make a soft fall and take no damage. If the check fails, you take 1d6 points of damage.</p><p><strong title="If You Are Dropped:">탈것에서 떨어진 경우:</strong> If you are knocked unconscious, you have a 50% chance to stay in the saddle (or 75% if you’re in a military saddle). Otherwise you fall and take 1d6 points of damage.</p><p>Without you to guide it, your mount avoids combat.</p></section><section id="h2-32-overrun"><h2 title="OVERRUN">쇄도</h2><p>You can attempt an overrun as a standard action taken during your move. (In general, you cannot take a standard action during a move; this is an exception.) With an overrun, you attempt to plow past or over your opponent (and move through his square) as you move. You can only overrun an opponent who is one size category larger than you, the same size, or smaller. You can make only one overrun attempt per round.</p><p>If you’re attempting to overrun an opponent, follow these steps.</p><p><strong title="Step 1:">스텝 1:</strong> Attack of Opportunity. Since you begin the overrun by moving into the defender’s space, you provoke an attack of opportunity from the defender.</p><p><strong title="Step 2:">스텝 2:</strong> Opponent Avoids? The defender has the option to simply avoid you. If he avoids you, he doesn’t suffer any ill effect and you may keep moving (You can always move through a square occupied by someone who lets you by.) The overrun attempt doesn’t count against your actions this round (except for any movement required to enter the opponent’s square). If your opponent doesn’t avoid you, move to Step 3.</p><p><strong title="Step 3:">스텝 3:</strong> Opponent Blocks? If your opponent blocks you, make a Strength check opposed by the defender’s Dexterity or Strength check (whichever ability score has the higher modifier). A combatant gets a +4 bonus on the check for every size category he is larger than Medium or a –4 penalty for every size category he is smaller than Medium. The defender gets a +4 bonus on his check if he has more than two legs or is otherwise more stable than a normal humanoid. If you win, you knock the defender prone. If you lose, the defender may immediately react and make a Strength check opposed by your Dexterity or Strength check (including the size modifiers noted above, but no other modifiers) to try to knock you prone.</p><p><strong title="Step 4:">스텝 4:</strong> Consequences. If you succeed in knocking your opponent prone, you can continue your movement as normal. If you fail and are knocked prone in turn, you have to move 5 feet back the way you came and fall prone, ending your movement there. If you fail but are not knocked prone, you have to move 5 feet back the way you came, ending your movement there. If that square is occupied, you fall prone in that square.</p><p><strong title="Improved Overrun:">향상된 쇄도:</strong> If you have the Improved Overrun feat, your target may not choose to avoid you.</p><p><strong title="Mounted Overrun (Trample):">탑승한 상태에서 쇄도 (짓밟기):</strong> If you attempt an overrun while mounted, your mount makes the Strength check to determine the success or failure of the overrun attack (and applies its size modifier, rather than yours). If you have the Trample feat and attempt an overrun while mounted, your target may not choose to avoid you, and if you knock your opponent prone with the overrun, your mount may make one hoof attack against your opponent.</p></section><section id="h2-33-sunder"><h2 title="SUNDER">무기 파괴</h2><p>You can use a melee attack with a slashing or bludgeoning weapon to strike a weapon or shield that your opponent is holding.

You provoke an attack of opportunity from the target whose weapon or shield you are trying to sunder. (If you have the Improved Sunder feat, you don’t incur an attack of opportunity for making the attempt.)</p><p><strong title="Step 2:">스텝 2:</strong> Opposed Rolls. You and the defender make opposed attack rolls with your respective weapons. The wielder of a two-handed weapon on a sunder attempt gets a +4 bonus on this roll, and the wielder of a light weapon takes a –4 penalty. If the combatants are of different sizes, the larger combatant gets a bonus on the attack roll of +4 per difference in size category.</p><p><strong title="Step 3:">스텝 3:</strong> Consequences. If you beat the defender, roll damage and deal it to the weapon or shield. See Table: Common Armor, Weapon, and Shield Hardness and Hit Points to determine how much damage you must deal to destroy the weapon or shield.</p><p>If you fail the sunder attempt, you don’t deal any damage.</p><p><em title="Sundering a Carried or Worn Object:">들고 있거나 입고 있는 것 파괴:</em> You don’t use an opposed attack roll to damage a carried or worn object. Instead, just make an attack roll against the object’s AC. A carried or worn object’s AC is equal to 10 + its size modifier + the Dexterity modifier of the carrying or wearing character. Attacking a carried or worn object provokes an attack of opportunity just as attacking a held object does. To attempt to snatch away an item worn by a defender rather than damage it, see Disarm. You can’t sunder armor worn by another character.</p></section><section id="h2-34-throw-splash-weapon"><h2 title="THROW SPLASH WEAPON">비산 무기 투척</h2><p>A splash weapon is a ranged weapon that breaks on impact, splashing or scattering its contents over its target and nearby creatures or objects. To attack with a splash weapon, make a ranged touch attack against the target. Thrown weapons require no weapon proficiency, so you don’t take the –4 nonproficiency penalty. A hit deals direct hit damage to the target, and splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the target.</p><p>You can instead target a specific grid intersection. Treat this as a ranged attack against AC 5. However, if you target a grid intersection, creatures in all adjacent squares are dealt the splash damage, and the direct hit damage is not dealt to any creature. (You can’t target a grid intersection occupied by a creature, such as a Large or larger creature; in this case, you’re aiming at the creature.)</p><p>If you miss the target (whether aiming at a creature or a grid intersection), roll 1d8. This determines the misdirection of the throw, with 1 being straight back at you and 2 through 8 counting clockwise around the grid intersection or target creature. Then, count a number of squares in the indicated direction equal to the range increment of the throw.</p><p>After you determine where the weapon landed, it deals splash damage to all creatures in adjacent squares.</p></section><section id="h2-35-trip"><h2 title="TRIP">넘어뜨리기</h2><p>You can try to trip an opponent as an unarmed melee attack. You can only trip an opponent who is one size category larger than you, the same size, or smaller.</p><p><strong title="Making a Trip Attack:">넘어뜨리기 공격 만들어내기:</strong> Make an unarmed melee touch attack against your target. This provokes an attack of opportunity from your target as normal for unarmed attacks.</p><p>If your attack succeeds, make a Strength check opposed by the defender’s Dexterity or Strength check (whichever ability score has the higher modifier). A combatant gets a +4 bonus for every size category he is larger than Medium or a –4 penalty for every size category he is smaller than Medium. The defender gets a +4 bonus on his check if he has more than two legs or is otherwise more stable than a normal humanoid. If you win, you trip the defender. If you lose, the defender may immediately react and make a Strength check opposed by your Dexterity or Strength check to try to trip you.</p><p><em title="Avoiding Attacks of Opportunity:">기회 공격 피해내기:</em> If you have the Improved Trip feat, or if you are tripping with a weapon (see below), you don’t provoke an attack of opportunity for making a trip attack.</p><p><strong title="Being Tripped (Prone):">넘어짐 (엎드림 상태):</strong> A tripped character is prone.

It does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p>You must present your holy symbol to turn undead. Turning is considered an attack.</p><p><strong title="Times per Day:">일일 횟수:</strong> You may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

You don’t need line of sight to a target, but you do need line of effect.</p><p><strong title="Turning Check:">구마 판정:</strong> The first thing you do is roll a turning check to see how powerful an undead creature you can turn. This is a Charisma check (1d20 + your Charisma modifier). Table: Turning Undead gives you the Hit Dice of the most powerful undead you can affect, relative to your level. On a given turning attempt, you can turn no undead creature whose Hit Dice exceed the result on this table.</p><p><strong title="Turning Damage:">구마 피해:</strong> If your roll on Table: Turning Undead is high enough to let you turn at least some of the undead within 60 feet, roll 2d6 + your cleric level + your Charisma modifier for turning damage. That’s how many total Hit Dice of undead you can turn.</p><p>If your Charisma score is average or low, it’s possible to roll fewer Hit Dice of undead turned than indicated on Table: Turning Undead.</p><p>You may skip over already turned undead that are still within range, so that you do not waste your turning capacity on them.</p><p><strong title="Effect and Duration of Turning:">구마의 효과와 지속시간:</strong> Turned undead flee from you by the best and fastest means available to them.
