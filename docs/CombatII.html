scale—a miniature figure of a six-foot-tall human is approximately 30mm tall. A square on the battle grid is 1 inch across, representing a 5-foot-by-5-foot area.</p><section id="h2-2-tactical-movement"><h2>전략적 이동</h2><section id="h5-3-how-far-can-your-character-move"><h5>내 캐릭터는 얼마나 이동할 수 있나?</h5><p>Your speed is determined by your race and your armor (see Table: Tactical Speed). Your speed while unarmored is your base land speed.</p><p><strong>과적상태:</strong> A character encumbered by carrying a large amount of gear, treasure, or fallen comrades may move slower than normal.</p><p><strong>험난한 이동:</strong> Difficult terrain, obstacles, or poor visibility can hamper movement.</p><p><strong>전투 중 이동:</strong> Generally, you can move your speed in a round and still do something (take a move action and a standard action).</p><p>If you do nothing but move (that is, if you use both of your actions in a round to move your speed), you can move double your speed.</p><p>If you spend the entire round running, you can move quadruple your speed. If you do something that requires a full round you can only take a 5-foot step.</p><p><strong>속도 보너스:</strong> A barbarian has a +10 foot bonus to his speed (unless he’s wearing heavy armor). Experienced monks also have higher speed (unless they’re wearing armor of any sort). In addition, many spells and magic items can affect a character’s speed. Always apply any modifiers to a character’s speed before adjusting the character’s speed based on armor or encumbrance, and remember that multiple bonuses of the same type to a character’s speed don’t stack.</p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><th>Table: Tactical 속도</th><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><th>종족</th><th>No 갑옷 or 가벼운 갑옷</th><th>중간 or 무거운 갑옷</th></tr><tr><td>인간, 엘프, 하프 엘프, 하프 오크</td><td>30 ft.(6 칸)</td><td>20 ft.(4 칸)</td></tr><tr><td>드워프</td><td>20 ft.(4 칸)</td><td>20 ft.(4 칸)</td></tr><tr><td>하플링, 노움</td><td>20 ft.(4 칸)</td><td>15 ft.(3 칸)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id="h5-4-measuring-distance"><h5>거리 측정</h5><p><strong>대각선:</strong> When measuring distance, the first diagonal counts as 1 square, the second counts as 2 squares, the third counts as 1, the fourth as 2, and so on.</p><p>You can’t move diagonally past a corner (even by taking a 5-foot step). You can move diagonally past a creature, even an opponent.</p><p>You can also move diagonally past other impassable obstacles, such as pits.</p><p><strong>가장 가까운 생명체:</strong> When it’s important to determine the closest square or creature to a location, if two squares or creatures are equally close, randomly determine which one counts as closest by rolling a die.</p></section><section id="h5-5-moving-through-a-square"><h5>한 정사각형 이동</h5><p><strong>친구:</strong> You can move through a square occupied by a friendly character, unless you are charging. When you move through a square occupied by a friendly character, that character doesn’t provide you with cover.</p><p><strong>상대방:</strong> You can’t move through a square occupied by an opponent, unless the opponent is helpless. You can move through a square occupied by a helpless opponent without penalty. (Some creatures, particularly very large ones, may present an obstacle even when helpless. In such cases, each square you move through counts as 2 squares.)</p><p><strong>이동 마치기:</strong> You can’t end your movement in the same square as another creature unless it is helpless.</p><p><strong>쇄도:</strong> During your movement you can attempt to move through a square occupied by an opponent.</p><p><strong>재주넘기:</strong> A trained character can attempt to tumble through a square occupied by an opponent (see the Tumble skill).</p><p><strong>아주 작은 생명체:</strong> A Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creature can move into or through an occupied square. The creature provokes attacks of opportunity when doing so.</p><p><strong>세 사이즈 이상 차이나는 생명체가 차지한 칸:</strong> Any creature can move through a square occupied by a creature three size categories larger than it is.</p><p>A big creature can move through a square occupied by a creature three size categories smaller than it is.</p><p><strong>정해진 예외:</strong> Some creatures break the above rules. A creature that completely fills the squares it occupies cannot be moved past, even with the Tumble skill or similar special abilities.</p></section><section id="h5-6-terrain-and-obstacles"><h5>지형 및 장애물</h5><p><strong>험한 지형:</strong> Difficult terrain hampers movement. Each square of difficult terrain counts as 2 squares of movement. (Each diagonal move into a difficult terrain square counts as 3 squares.) You can’t run or charge across difficult terrain.</p><p>If you occupy squares with different kinds of terrain, you can move only as fast as the most difficult terrain you occupy will allow.</p><p>Flying and incorporeal creatures are not hampered by difficult terrain.</p><p><strong>장애물:</strong> Like difficult terrain, obstacles can hamper movement. If an obstacle hampers movement but doesn’t completely block it each obstructed square or obstacle between squares counts as 2 squares of movement. You must pay this cost to cross the barrier, in addition to the cost to move into the square on the other side. If you don’t have sufficient movement to cross the barrier and move into the square on the other side, you can’t cross the barrier. Some obstacles may also require a skill check to cross.</p><p>On the other hand, some obstacles block movement entirely. A character can’t move through a blocking obstacle.</p><p>Flying and incorporeal creatures can avoid most obstacles</p><p><strong>끼어서 이동:</strong> In some cases, you may have to squeeze into or through an area that isn’t as wide as the space you take up. You can squeeze through or into a space that is at least half as wide as your normal space. Each move into or through a narrow space counts as if it were 2 squares, and while squeezed in a narrow space you take a –4 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty to AC.</p><p>When a Large creature (which normally takes up four squares) squeezes into a space that’s one square wide, the creature’s miniature figure occupies two squares, centered on the line between the two squares. For a bigger creature, center the creature likewise in the area it squeezes into.</p><p>A creature can squeeze past an opponent while moving but it can’t end its movement in an occupied square.</p><p>To squeeze through or into a space less than half your space’s width, you must use the Escape Artist skill. You can’t attack while using Escape Artist to squeeze through or into a narrow space, you take a –4 penalty to AC, and you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.</p></section><section id="h5-7-special-movement-rules"><h5>특수 이동 규칙</h5><p>These rules cover special movement situations.</p><p><strong>갑자기 규칙상 잘못된 공간에서 이동이 끝난 경우:</strong> Sometimes a character ends its movement while moving through a space where it’s not allowed to stop. When that happens, put your miniature in the last legal position you occupied, or the closest legal position, if there’s a legal position that’s closer.</p><p><strong>두배 이동 비용:</strong> When your movement is hampered in some way, your movement usually costs double. For example, each square of movement through difficult terrain counts as 2 squares, and each diagonal move through such terrain counts as 3 squares (just as two diagonal moves normally do).</p><p>If movement cost is doubled twice, then each square counts as 4 squares (or as 6 squares if moving diagonally). If movement cost is doubled three times, then each square counts as 8 squares (12 if diagonal) and so on. This is an exception to the general rule that two doublings are equivalent to a tripling.</p><p><strong>최소 이동:</strong> Despite penalties to movement, you can take a full-round action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any direction, even diagonally. (This rule doesn’t allow you to move through impassable terrain or to move when all movement is prohibited.) Such movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal (despite the distance covered, this move isn’t a 5-foot step).</p></section></section><section id="h2-8-big-and-little-creatures-in-combat"><h2>크거나 작은 생명체의 전투</h2><p>Creatures smaller than Small or larger than Medium have special rules relating to position. </p><p><strong>특소형, 초소형, 극초소형 생명체:</strong> Very small creatures take up less than 1 square of space. This means that more than one such creature can fit into a single square. A Tiny creature typically occupies a space only 2-1/2 feet across, so four can fit into a single square. Twenty-five Diminutive creatures or 100 Fine creatures can fit into a single square. Creatures that take up less than 1 square of space typically have a natural reach of 0 feet, meaning they can’t reach into adjacent squares. They must enter an opponent’s square to attack in melee. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the opponent. You can attack into your own square if you need to, so you can attack such creatures normally. Since they have no natural reach, they do not threaten the squares around them. You can move past them without provoking attacks of opportunity. They also can’t flank an enemy.</p><p><strong>대형, 특대형, 거대형, 초대형 생명체:</strong> Very large creatures take up more than 1 square.</p><p>Creatures that take up more than 1 square typically have a natural reach of 10 feet or more, meaning that they can reach targets even if they aren’t in adjacent squares.</p><p>Unlike when someone uses a reach weapon, a creature with greater than normal natural reach (more than 5 feet) still threatens squares adjacent to it. A creature with greater than normal natural reach usually gets an attack of opportunity against you if you approach it, because you must enter and move within the range of its reach before you can attack it. (This attack of opportunity is not provoked if you take a 5-foot step.)</p><p>Large or larger creatures using reach weapons can strike up to double their natural reach but can’t strike at their natural reach or less. </p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><th style="min-width: 14.775em;">Table: 생명체 크기 및 Scale</th><td style="min-width: 4.425em;"></td><td style="min-width: 8.325em;"></td></tr><tr><th>생명체 크기</th><th>Space<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></th><th>Natural Reach<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></th></tr><tr><td>극초소형</td><td>1/2 ft.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>초소형</td><td>1 ft.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>특소형</td><td>2-1/2 ft.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>소형</td><td>5 ft.</td><td>5 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>중간</td><td>5 ft.</td><td>5 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>대형 (tall)</td><td>10 ft.</td><td>10 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>대형 (멂)</td><td>10 ft.</td><td>5 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>특대형 (tall)</td><td>15 ft.</td><td>15 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>특대형 (멂)</td><td>15 ft.</td><td>10 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>거대형 (tall)</td><td>20 ft.</td><td>20 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>거대형 (멂)</td><td>20 ft.</td><td>15 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>초대형 (tall)</td><td>30 ft.</td><td>30 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>초대형 (멂)</td><td>30 ft.</td><td>20 ft.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">1 These values are typical for 생명체 of the indicated 크기.

If any line from this corner to any corner of the target’s square passes through a square or border that blocks line of effect or provides cover, or through a square occupied by a creature, the target has cover (+4 to AC).</p><p>When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your target has cover if any line from your square to the target’s square goes through a wall (including a low wall). When making a melee attack against a target that isn’t adjacent to you (such as with a reach weapon), use the rules for determining cover from ranged attacks.</p><p><strong>낮은 장애물 및 엄폐:</strong> A low obstacle (such as a wall no higher than half your height) provides cover, but only to creatures within 30 feet (6 squares) of it. The attacker can ignore the cover if he’s closer to the obstacle than his target.</p><p><strong>엄폐 및 기회 공격:</strong> You can’t execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with cover relative to you.</p><p><strong>엄폐 및 반사 내성 굴림:</strong> Cover grants you a +2 bonus on Reflex saves against attacks that originate or burst out from a point on the other side of the cover from you.

You provoke an attack of opportunity from the target whose weapon or shield you are trying to sunder. (If you have the Improved Sunder feat, you don’t incur an attack of opportunity for making the attempt.)</p><p><strong>스텝 2:</strong> Opposed Rolls. You and the defender make opposed attack rolls with your respective weapons. The wielder of a two-handed weapon on a sunder attempt gets a +4 bonus on this roll, and the wielder of a light weapon takes a –4 penalty. If the combatants are of different sizes, the larger combatant gets a bonus on the attack roll of +4 per difference in size category.</p><p><strong>스텝 3:</strong> Consequences. If you beat the defender, roll damage and deal it to the weapon or shield. See Table: Common Armor, Weapon, and Shield Hardness and Hit Points to determine how much damage you must deal to destroy the weapon or shield.</p><p>If you fail the sunder attempt, you don’t deal any damage.</p><p><em>들고 있거나 입고 있는 것 파괴:</em> You don’t use an opposed attack roll to damage a carried or worn object. Instead, just make an attack roll against the object’s AC. A carried or worn object’s AC is equal to 10 + its size modifier + the Dexterity modifier of the carrying or wearing character. Attacking a carried or worn object provokes an attack of opportunity just as attacking a held object does. To attempt to snatch away an item worn by a defender rather than damage it, see Disarm. You can’t sunder armor worn by another character.</p></section><section id="h2-34-throw-splash-weapon"><h2>비산 무기 투척</h2><p>A splash weapon is a ranged weapon that breaks on impact, splashing or scattering its contents over its target and nearby creatures or objects. To attack with a splash weapon, make a ranged touch attack against the target. Thrown weapons require no weapon proficiency, so you don’t take the –4 nonproficiency penalty. A hit deals direct hit damage to the target, and splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the target.</p><p>You can instead target a specific grid intersection. Treat this as a ranged attack against AC 5. However, if you target a grid intersection, creatures in all adjacent squares are dealt the splash damage, and the direct hit damage is not dealt to any creature. (You can’t target a grid intersection occupied by a creature, such as a Large or larger creature; in this case, you’re aiming at the creature.)</p><p>If you miss the target (whether aiming at a creature or a grid intersection), roll 1d8. This determines the misdirection of the throw, with 1 being straight back at you and 2 through 8 counting clockwise around the grid intersection or target creature. Then, count a number of squares in the indicated direction equal to the range increment of the throw.</p><p>After you determine where the weapon landed, it deals splash damage to all creatures in adjacent squares.</p></section><section id="h2-35-trip"><h2>넘어뜨리기</h2><p>You can try to trip an opponent as an unarmed melee attack. You can only trip an opponent who is one size category larger than you, the same size, or smaller.</p><p><strong>넘어뜨리기 공격 만들어내기:</strong> Make an unarmed melee touch attack against your target. This provokes an attack of opportunity from your target as normal for unarmed attacks.</p><p>If your attack succeeds, make a Strength check opposed by the defender’s Dexterity or Strength check (whichever ability score has the higher modifier). A combatant gets a +4 bonus for every size category he is larger than Medium or a –4 penalty for every size category he is smaller than Medium. The defender gets a +4 bonus on his check if he has more than two legs or is otherwise more stable than a normal humanoid. If you win, you trip the defender. If you lose, the defender may immediately react and make a Strength check opposed by your Dexterity or Strength check to try to trip you.</p><p><em>기회 공격 피해내기:</em> If you have the Improved Trip feat, or if you are tripping with a weapon (see below), you don’t provoke an attack of opportunity for making a trip attack.</p><p><strong>넘어짐 (엎드림 상태):</strong> A tripped character is prone. Standing up is a move action.</p><p><strong>탈것에 탑승한 상대방 넘어뜨리기:</strong> You may make a trip attack against a mounted opponent. The defender may make a Ride check in place of his Dexterity or Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the rider from his mount.</p><p><strong>무기로 넘어뜨리기:</strong> Some weapons can be used to make trip attacks. In this case, you make a melee touch attack with the weapon instead of an unarmed melee touch attack, and you don’t provoke an attack of opportunity.</p><p>If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the weapon to avoid being tripped.</p></section><section id="h2-36-turn-or-rebuke-undead"><h2>언데드 퇴치</h2><p>Good clerics and paladins and some neutral clerics can channel positive energy, which can halt, drive off (rout), or destroy undead.</p><p>Evil clerics and some neutral clerics can channel negative energy, which can halt, awe (rebuke), control (command), or bolster undead.</p><p>Regardless of the effect, the general term for the activity is “turning.” When attempting to exercise their divine control over these creatures, characters make turning checks.</p><section id="h5-37-turning-checks"><h5>구마 판정</h5><p>Turning undead is a supernatural ability that a character can perform as a standard action. It does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p>You must present your holy symbol to turn undead. Turning is considered an attack.</p><p><strong>일일 횟수:</strong> You may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You can increase this number by taking the Extra Turning feat.</p><p><strong>거리:</strong> You turn the closest turnable undead first, and you can’t turn undead that are more than 60 feet away or that have total cover relative to you. You don’t need line of sight to a target, but you do need line of effect.</p><p><strong>구마 판정:</strong> The first thing you do is roll a turning check to see how powerful an undead creature you can turn. This is a Charisma check (1d20 + your Charisma modifier). Table: Turning Undead gives you the Hit Dice of the most powerful undead you can affect, relative to your level. On a given turning attempt, you can turn no undead creature whose Hit Dice exceed the result on this table.</p><p><strong>구마 피해:</strong> If your roll on Table: Turning Undead is high enough to let you turn at least some of the undead within 60 feet, roll 2d6 + your cleric level + your Charisma modifier for turning damage. That’s how many total Hit Dice of undead you can turn.</p><p>If your Charisma score is average or low, it’s possible to roll fewer Hit Dice of undead turned than indicated on Table: Turning Undead.</p><p>You may skip over already turned undead that are still within range, so that you do not waste your turning capacity on them.</p><p><strong>구마의 효과와 지속시간:</strong> Turned undead flee from you by the best and fastest means available to them. They flee for 10 rounds (1 minute). If they cannot flee, they cower (giving any attack rolls against them a +2 bonus). If you approach within 10 feet of them, however, they overcome being turned and act normally. (You can stand within 10 feet without breaking the turning effect—you just can’t approach them.) You can attack them with ranged attacks (from at least 10 feet away), and others can attack them in any fashion, without breaking the turning effect.</p><p><strong>언데드 파괴하기:</strong> If you have twice as many levels (or more) as the undead have Hit Dice, you destroy any that you would normally turn.</p><div class="table-container"><table><caption>Table: Turning Undead</caption><tbody><tr><th style="min-width: 6.825em;">구마 판정 Result</th><th style="min-width: 14.4em;">Most Powerful 언데드 Affected (최대 히트 다이스)</th></tr><tr><td>0 이하</td><td>Cleric의 레벨 – 4</td></tr><tr><td>1–3</td><td>Cleric의 레벨 – 3</td></tr><tr><td>4–6</td><td>Cleric의 레벨 – 2</td></tr><tr><td>7–9</td><td>Cleric의 레벨 – 1</td></tr><tr><td>10–12</td><td>Cleric의 레벨</td></tr><tr><td>13–15</td><td>Cleric의 레벨 + 1</td></tr><tr><td>16–18</td><td>Cleric의 레벨 + 2</td></tr><tr><td>19–21</td><td>Cleric의 레벨 + 3</td></tr><tr><td>22 이상</td><td>Cleric의 레벨 + 4</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Evil Clerics and Undead</p><p>Evil clerics channel negative energy to rebuke (awe) or command (control) undead rather than channeling positive energy to turn or destroy them.

The effect lasts 10 rounds.</p><p><strong>명령받음:</strong> A commanded undead creature is under the mental control of the evil cleric. The cleric must take a standard action to give mental orders to a commanded undead. At any one time, the cleric may command any number of undead whose total Hit Dice do not exceed his level.

The evil cleric makes a turning check as if attempting to rebuke the undead. If the turning check result is equal to or greater than the turning check result that the good cleric scored when turning the undead, then the undead are no longer turned. The evil cleric rolls turning damage of 2d6 + cleric level + Charisma modifier to see how many Hit Dice worth of undead he can affect in this way (as if he were rebuking them).</p><p><strong>언데드 강화하기:</strong> An evil cleric may also bolster undead creatures against turning in advance. He makes a turning check as if attempting to rebuke the undead, but the Hit Dice result on Table: Turning Undead becomes the undead creatures’ effective Hit Dice as far as turning is concerned (provided the result is higher than the creatures’ actual Hit Dice).

When you delay, you voluntarily reduce your own initiative result for the rest of the combat. When your new, lower initiative count comes up later in the same round, you can act normally.

The action occurs just before the action that triggers it. If the triggered action is part of another character’s activities, you interrupt the other character. Assuming he is still capable of doing so, he continues his actions once you complete your readied action. Your initiative result changes.

In this case, when the spellcaster starts a spell, you get a chance to identify it with a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If you do, and if you can cast that same spell (are able to cast it and have it prepared, if you prepare spells), you can cast the spell as a counterspell and automatically ruin the other spellcaster’s spell.
