        <span style="font-weight: 700">능력 점수 손실(Su):</span
        ><span>

          >This 공격 피해 an opponent’s ability score. The creature’s 설명 문구 gives the ability and the amount of
          피해. If an 공격 that causes ability 피해 scores a critical hit, it deals twice the indicated amount of 피해
          (if 피해 is expressed as a die 거리, roll two 주사위). Ability 피해 returns at the rate of 1 point per day
          for each affected ability.</span

        ><span
          >This effect permanently reduces a living opponent’s ability score when the creature hits with a melee 공격.
          The creature’s 설명 문구 gives the ability and the amount drained. If an 공격 that causes ability drain scores
          a critical hit, it drains twice the indicated amount (if 피해 is expressed as a die 거리, roll two
          주사위). Unless otherwise specified in the creature’s 묘사, a draining creature gains 5 임시 히트 포인트(10
          on a critical hit) whenever it drains an ability score no matter how many points it drains. 임시 히트 포인트
          gained in this fashion last for a maximum of 1 hour.</span

      <p>
        Some ability drain 공격 allow a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 draining creature’s racial HD + draining creature’s
        Cha 수정치; the exact DC is given in the creature’s 설명 문구). If no 내성 굴림 is mentioned, none is allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700">Alternate Form (Su):</span
        ><span>
          A creature with this special quality has the ability to assume one or more specific alternate forms. This
          ability works much like the <span style="font-style: italic">변이 </span>spell, except that the creature is
          limited to the forms specified, and does not regain any 히트 포인트 for changing its form. Assuming an
          alternate form results in the following changes to the creature:</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>—The creature retains the type and subtype of its original form. It gains the size of its new form.</p>
      <p>
        —The creature loses the natural 무기, natural 갑옷, 이동 modes, and extraordinary 특수 공격 of its original
        form.
      </p>
      <p>
        —The creature gains the natural 무기, natural 갑옷, 이동 modes, and extraordinary 특수 공격 of its new form.
      </p>
      <p>—The creature retains 특성 of its original form. It does not gain any 특성 of its new form.</p>
      <p>
        —The creature retains the spell-like 능력 and supernatural 공격 of its old form (except for 브레스 무기 and 시선
        공격). It does not gain the spell-like 능력 or supernatural 공격 of its new form.
      </p>
      <p>
        —The creature gains the physical 능력 점수(Str, Dex, Con) of its new form. It retains the mental 능력 점수
        (Int, Wis, Cha) of its original form.
      </p>
      <p>
        —The creature retains its 히트 포인트 and save 보너스, although its save 수정치 may change due to a change
        in 능력 점수.
      </p>
      <p>
        —The creature retains any spellcasting ability it had in its original form, although it must be able to 말하기
        intelligibly to cast 주문 with verbal 구성요소 and it must have humanlike hands to cast 주문 with somatic
        구성요소.
      </p>
      <p>
        —The creature is effectively camouflaged as a creature of its new form, and it gains a +10 보너스 on 변장 checks
        if it uses this ability to create a 변장.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700">Air Subtype:</span
        ><span>
          This subtype usually is used for 정령 and outsiders with a connection to 정령 Plane Air. Air creatures
          always have 비행 속도 and usually have perfect maneuverability.</span

      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700">천사 Subtype:</span
        ><span> 천사 are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to the good-aligned Outer 이세계.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic">Traits: </span
        ><span>An 천사 possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span>
      </p>
      <p>—암흑시야 out to 60 feet and 저광시야.</p>
      <p>—Immunity to acid, cold, and petrification.</p>
      <p>—저항 to electricity 10 and fire 10.</p>
      <p>— +4 racial 보너스 on 내성 굴림 against 독.</p>
      <p>
        —Protective Aura (Su): Against 공격 made or effects created by evil creatures,
        <span style="font-style: italic">t</span>his ability provides a +4 deflection 보너스 to AC and a +4 저항 보너스 on
        내성 굴림 to anyone within 20 feet of 천사. Otherwise, it functions as a
        <span style="font-style: italic">악 방어 마법진 </span>effect and a
        <span style="font-style: italic">하급 무적의 보주, </span>both with a radius of 20 feet (시전자 레벨 equals
        천사’s HD). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an 천사’s 수치 표.)
      </p>
      <p>
        —통역마법(Su): All 천사 can 말하기 with any creature that has a language, as though using a
        <span style="font-style: italic">통역마법 </span>spell (시전자 레벨 equal to 천사’s 히트 다이스). This ability
        is always active.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700">Animal Type:</span
        ><span>
          An animal is a living, nonhuman creature, usually a vertebrate with no magical 능력 and no innate capacity for
          language or culture.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic">Features: </span
        ><span>An animal has the following features (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span>
      </p>
      <p>—d8 히트 다이스.</p>
      <p>—Base 공격 보너스 equal to 3/4 total 히트 다이스(as 사제).</p>
      <p>—Good Fortitude and Reflex 내성 굴림(certain animals have different good 내성 굴림).</p>
      <p>
        —Skill points equal to (2 + Int 수정치, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
        Die.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic">Traits: </span
        ><span>An animal possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span>
      </p>
      <p>—지능 score of 1 or 2 (no creature with an 지능 score of 3 or higher can be an animal).</p>
      <p>—저광시야.</p>
      <p>—성향: Always neutral.</p>
      <p>—전리품: None.</p>
      <p>
        —Proficient with its natural 무기 only. A noncombative herbivore uses its natural 무기 as a secondary 공격. Such
        공격 are made with a –5 페널티 on the creature’s 명중 굴림, and the animal receives only 1/2 its 근력 수정치
        as a 피해 adjustment.
      </p>
      <p>—Proficient with no 갑옷 unless trained for war.</p>
      <p>—Animals eat, 수면, and breathe.</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700">Aquatic Subtype:</span
        ><span>
          These creatures always have 수영 속도 and thus can 이동 in water without making 수영 checks. An aquatic
          creature can breathe underwater. It cannot also breathe air unless it has the amphibious special quality.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700">아콘 Subtype:</span
        ><span> 아콘 are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to lawful good-aligned Outer 이세계.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic">Traits: </span
        ><span>An 아콘 possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span>
      </p>
      <p>—암흑시야 out to 60 feet and 저광시야.</p>
      <p>
        —Aura of Menace (Su): A righteous aura surrounds 아콘 that fight or get angry. Any hostile creature within a
        20-foot radius of an 아콘 must succeed on a Will save to resist its effects. The save DC varies with the type of
        아콘, is 매력-based, and includes a +2 racial 보너스. Those who fail take a –2 페널티 on 공격, AC, and 내성 굴림
        for 24 hours or until they successfully hit 아콘 that generated the aura. A creature that has resisted or
        broken the effect cannot be affected again by the same 아콘’s aura for 24 hours.
      </p>
      <p>—Immunity to electricity and petrification.</p>
      <p>— +4 racial 보너스 on 내성 굴림 against 독.</p>
      <p>
        —악 방어 마법진(Su): A 악 방어 마법진 effect always surrounds an 아콘(시전자 레벨 equals 아콘’s 히트
        다이스). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an 아콘’s 수치 표.)
      </p>
      <p>
        —순간이동(Su): 아콘 can use 상급 순간이동 at will, as the spell (시전자 레벨 14th), except that the creature
        can 운송수단 only itself and up to 50 pounds of objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        —통역마법(Su): All 아콘 can 말하기 with any creature that has a language, as though using a
        <span style="font-style: italic">통역마법 </span>spell (시전자 레벨 14th). This ability is always active.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700">Augmented Subtype:</span
        ><span>
          A creature receives this subtype whenever something happens to change its original type. Some creatures (those
          with an inherited template) are born with this subtype; others acquire it when they take on an acquired
          template. The augmented subtype is always paired with the creature’s original type. A creature with the
          augmented subtype usually has the traits of its current type, but the features of its original type.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700">Blindsense (Ex):</span
        ><span>
          Using nonvisual senses, such as acute smell or hearing, a creature with blindsense notices things it cannot
          see. The creature usually does not need to make 감지 or 듣기 checks to pinpoint the location of a creature
          within 거리 of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to that creature. Any opponent the
          creature cannot see still has total 은폐 against the creature with blindsense, and the creature still has the
          normal miss chance when attacking foes that have 은폐. Visibility still affects 이동 of a creature with
          blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its 민첩 보너스 to 방어도 against 공격 from creatures it
          cannot see.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700">Blindsight (Ex):</span
        ><span>
          This ability is similar to blindsense, but is far more discerning. Using nonvisual senses, such as sensitivity
          to vibrations, keen smell, acute hearing, or echolocation, a creature with blindsight maneuvers and fights as
          well as a sighted creature. 투명화, 암흑, and most kinds of 은폐 are irrelevant, though the creature must have
          line of effect to a creature or object to discern that creature or object. The ability’s 거리 is specified in
          the creature’s 설명 문구. The creature usually does not need to make 감지 or 듣기 checks to notice creatures
          within 거리 of its blindsight ability. Unless noted otherwise, blindsight is continuous, and the creature need
          do nothing to use it. Some forms of blindsight, however, must be triggered as a free action. If so, this is
          noted in the creature’s 묘사. If a creature must 신관 its blindsight ability, the creature gains the benefits
          of blindsight only during its turn.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700">브레스 무기(Su): </span
        ><span>A 브레스 무기 공격 usually deals 피해 and is often based on some type of energy.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Such 브레스 무기 allow a Reflex save for half 피해(DC 10 + 1/2 breathing creature’s racial HD + breathing
        creature’s Con 수정치; the exact DC is given in the creature’s 설명 문구). A creature is immune to its own
        브레스 무기 unless otherwise noted. Some 브레스 무기 allow a Fortitude save or a Will save instead of a Reflex
        save.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700">Change Shape (Su):</span
        ><span>
          A creature with this special quality has the ability to assume the appearance of a specific creature or type
          of creature (usually a humanoid), but retains most of its own physical qualities. A creature cannot change
          shape to a form more than one size category smaller or larger than its original form. Changing shape results
          in the following changes to the creature:</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>—The creature retains the type and subtype of its original form. It gains the size of its new form.</p>
      <p>—The creature loses the natural 무기, 이동 modes, and extraordinary 특수 공격 of its original form.</p>
      <p>—The creature gains the natural 무기, 이동 modes, and extraordinary 특수 공격 of its new form.</p>
      <p>
        —The creature retains all other 특수 공격 and qualities of its original form, except for 브레스 무기 and 시선
        공격.
      </p>
      <p>—The creature retains 능력 점수 of its original form.</p>
      <p>—The creature retains its 히트 포인트 and 내성 굴림.</p>
      <p>
        —The creature retains any spellcasting ability it had in its original form, although it must be able to 말하기
        intelligibly to cast 주문 with verbal 구성요소 and it must have humanlike hands to cast 주문 with somatic
        구성요소.
      </p>
      <p>
        —The creature is effectively camouflaged as a creature of its new form, and gains a +10 보너스 on 변장 checks if
        it uses this ability to create a 변장.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700">Chaotic Subtype: </span
        ><span
          >A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the chaotic-aligned Outer 이세계. Most creatures that
          have this subtype also have chaotic 성향; however, if their 성향 change they still retain the subtype. Any
          effect that depends on 성향 affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has a chaotic 성향, no
          matter what its 성향 actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual 성향. A creature
          with the chaotic subtype overcomes 피해 축소 as if its natural 무기 and any 무기 it wields were
          chaotic-aligned (see 피해 축소, below).</span

          A creature with this special 공격 can crush an opponent, dealing bludgeoning 피해, after making a successful
          드잡이 check. The amount of 피해 is given in the creature’s entry. If the creature also has the improved grab

          A creature with this special quality ignores 피해 from most 무기 and natural 공격. Wounds 치료 immediately, or
          the weapon bounces off harmlessly (in either case, the opponent knows 공격 was ineffective). The creature
          takes normal 피해 from energy 공격(even nonmagical ones), 주문, spell-like 능력, and supernatural 능력. A
          certain kind of weapon can sometimes 피해 the creature normally, as noted below.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The entry indicates the amount of 피해 ignored (usually 5 to 15 points) and the type of weapon that negates the
        ability.
      </p>
      <p>Some 몬스터 are vulnerable to piercing, bludgeoning, or slashing 피해.</p>
      <p>
        Some 몬스터 are vulnerable to certain materials, such as alchemical silver, adamantine, or cold-forged iron.
        공격 from 무기 that are not made of the correct material have their 피해 reduced, even if the weapon has an
        enhancement 보너스.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some 몬스터 are vulnerable to 마법 무기. Any weapon with at least a +1 magical enhancement 보너스 on 공격 and
        피해 rolls overcomes 피해 축소 of these 몬스터. Such creatures’ natural 무기(but not their 공격 with 무기)
        are treated as 마법 무기 for 목적 of overcoming 피해 축소.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few very powerful 몬스터 are vulnerable only to 에픽 무기; that is, 마법 무기 with at least a +6 enhancement
        보너스. Such creatures’ natural 무기 are also treated as 에픽 무기 for 목적 of overcoming 피해 축소.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some 몬스터 are vulnerable to chaotic-, evil-, good-, or lawful-aligned 무기. When a 사제 casts
        <span style="font-style: italic">무기 성향 지정, </span>affected 무기 might gain one or more of these
        properties, and certain 마법 무기 have these properties as well. A creature with an 성향 subtype (chaotic, evil,
        good, or lawful) can overcome this type of 피해 축소 with its natural 무기 and 무기 it wields as if 무기 or
        natural 무기 had an 성향(or 성향) that match the subtype(s) of the creature.
      </p>
      <p>When a 피해 축소 entry has a dash (–) after the slash, no weapon negates 피해 축소.</p>
      <p>
        A few creatures are harmed by more than one kind of weapon. A weapon of either type overcomes this 피해 축소.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few other creatures require combinations of different types of 공격 to overcome their 피해 축소. A weapon must
        be both types to overcome this 피해 축소. A weapon that is only one type is still subject to 피해 축소.

        <span style="font-weight: 700">정령 흡수(Su):</span
        ><span>
          This 공격 saps a living opponent’s vital energy and happens automatically when a melee or ranged 공격 hits.
          Each successful 정령 흡수 bestows one or more negative 레벨(the creature’s 묘사 specifies how many). If an
          공격 that includes an 정령 흡수 scores a critical hit, it drains twice the given amount. Unless otherwise
          specified in the creature’s 묘사, a draining creature gains 5 임시 히트 포인트(10 on a critical hit) for each
          negative 레벨 it bestows on an opponent. These 임시 히트 포인트 last for a maximum of 1 hour. An affected
          opponent takes a –1 페널티 on all 스킬 판정 and 능력 판정, 명중 굴림, and 내성 굴림, and loses one effective
          레벨 or Hit Die (whenever 레벨 is used in a die roll or calculation) for each negative 레벨. A spellcaster
          loses one spell slot of the highest 레벨 of 주문 she can cast and (if applicable) one prepared spell of that
          레벨; this loss persists until the negative 레벨 is removed. Negative 레벨 remain until 24 hours have passed
          or until they are removed with a spell, such as <span style="font-style: italic">복원</span>. If a negative
          레벨 is not removed before 24 hours have passed, the affected creature must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 +
          1/2 draining creature’s racial HD + draining creature’s Cha 수정치; the exact DC is given in the creature’s
          설명 문구). On a success, the negative 레벨 goes away with no 해악 to the creature. On a failure, the negative
          레벨 goes away, but the creature’s 레벨 is also reduced by one. A separate 내성 굴림 is required for each
          negative 레벨.</span

          called fiends. Most creatures that have this subtype also have evil 성향; however, if their 성향 change, they
          still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on 성향 affects a creature with this subtype as if the

          A subtype applied to any creature when it is on a plane other than its native plane. A creature that travels

          encounters with creatures take place on 물질 세계, and every creature whose native plane is not 물질 세계 has
          the extraplanar subtype (but would not have when on its home plane). Every extraplanar creature in this book
          has a home plane mentioned in its 묘사. Creatures not labeled as extraplanar are natives of 물질 세계, and
          they gain the extraplanar subtype if they leave 물질 세계. No creature has the extraplanar subtype when it is

          the creature 공연 some sort of dramatic action (such as charging, attacking, or snarling). Opponents within
          거리 who witness the action may become frightened or shaken. Actions required to 신관 the ability are given in
          the creature’s 설명 문구. 거리 is usually 30 feet, and 지속시간 is usually 5d6 rounds. This ability
          affects only opponents with fewer 히트 다이스 or 레벨 than the creature has. An affected opponent can resist
          the effects with a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 frightful creature’s racial HD + frightful creature’s Cha
          수정치; the exact DC is given in the creature’s 설명 문구). An opponent that succeeds on 내성 굴림 is
          immune to that same creature’s 끔찍한 존재 for 24 hours. 끔찍한 존재 is a mind-affecting 공포 effect.

        ><span>
          A gaze special 공격 takes effect when opponents look at the creature’s eyes. 공격 can have almost any sort
          of effect: petrification, death, charm, and so on. The typical 거리 is 30 feet, but check the creature’s entry
          for details. The type of 내성 굴림 for a gaze 공격 varies, but it is usually a Will or Fortitude save (DC 10 +
          1/2 gazing creature’s racial HD + gazing creature’s Cha 수정치; the exact DC is given in the creature’s 설명
          문구). A successful 내성 굴림 negates the effect. A monster’s gaze 공격 is described in abbreviated form in
          its 묘사. Each opponent within 거리 of a gaze 공격 must attempt a 내성 굴림 each round at the beginning of his
          or her turn in 선제권 order. Only looking directly at a creature with a gaze 공격 leaves an opponent
          vulnerable. Opponents can avoid the need to make 내성 굴림 by not looking at the creature, in one of two
          ways.

      </p>
      <p>
        A creature with a gaze 공격 can actively gaze as an 공격 action by choosing a target within 거리. That opponent
        must attempt a 내성 굴림 but can try to avoid this as described above. Thus, it is possible for an opponent to
        save against a creature’s gaze twice during the same round, once before the opponent’s action and once during
        the creature’s turn.

        Allies of a creature with a gaze 공격 might be affected. All the creature’s allies are considered to be averting
        their eyes from the creature with the gaze 공격, and have a 50% chance to not need to make a 내성 굴림 against
        the gaze 공격 each round. The creature also can 가리개 its eyes, thus negating its gaze ability.

        <span style="font-weight: 700">Improved Grab (Ex):</span
        ><span>
          If a creature with this special 공격 hits with a melee weapon (usually a claw or bite 공격), it deals normal
          피해 and attempts to start a 드잡이 as a free action without provoking an 공격 of opportunity. No initial
          touch 공격 is required. Unless otherwise noted, improved grab works only against opponents at least one size
          category smaller than the creature. The creature has the option to conduct 드잡이 normally, or simply use
          the part of its body it used in the improved grab to hold the opponent. If it chooses to do the latter, it
          takes a –20 페널티 on 드잡이 checks, but is not considered grappled itself; the creature does not lose its
          민첩 보너스 to AC, still threatens an 범위, and can use its remaining 공격 against other opponents. A
          successful hold does not deal any extra 피해 unless the creature also has the constrict special 공격. If the
          creature does not constrict, each successful 드잡이 check it makes during successive rounds automatically
          deals 피해 indicated for 공격 that established the hold. Otherwise, it deals constriction 피해 as well
          (the amount is given in the creature’s 설명 문구). When a creature gets a hold after an improved grab 공격, it
          pulls the opponent into its space. This act does not provoke 기회 공격. It can even 이동(possibly carrying
          away the opponent), provided it can drag the opponent’s weight.

          An incorporeal creature has no physical body. It can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, 마법 무기
          or creatures that strike as 마법 무기, and 주문, spell-like 능력, or supernatural 능력. It is immune to all
          nonmagical 공격 forms. Even when hit by 주문 or 마법 무기, it has a 50% chance to ignore any 피해 from a
          corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy, force effects such as
          <span style="font-style: italic">마법 화살, </span>or 공격 made with
          <span style="font-style: italic">유령 touch </span>무기). Although it is not a magical 공격, holy water can
          affect incorporeal undead, but a hit with holy water has a 50% chance of not affecting an incorporeal
          creature.</span

        An incorporeal creature has no natural 갑옷 보너스 but has a deflection 보너스 equal to its 매력 보너스(always at
        least +1, even if the creature’s 매력 score does not normally provide 보너스).
      </p>
      <p>
        An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid objects, but must remain adjacent to the object’s
        exterior, and so cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than its own. It can sense the
        presence of creatures or objects within a square adjacent to its current location, but enemies have total 은폐
        (50% miss chance) from an incorporeal creature that is inside an object. In order to see farther from the object
        it is in and 공격 normally, the incorporeal creature must emerge. An incorporeal creature inside an object has
        total 엄폐, but when it 공격 a creature outside the object it only has 엄폐, so a creature outside with a
        readied action could strike at it as it 공격. An incorporeal creature cannot pass through a force effect.

      <p>
        An incorporeal creature’s 공격 pass through (ignore) natural 갑옷, 갑옷, and 방패, although deflection 보너스
        and force effects (such as <span style="font-style: italic">마법사의 갑옷</span>) work normally against it.
        Incorporeal creatures pass through and operate in water as easily as they do in air. Incorporeal creatures
        cannot fall or take 낙하 피해. Incorporeal creatures cannot make 넘어뜨리기 or 드잡이 공격, nor can they be
        tripped or grappled. In fact, they cannot take any physical action that would 이동 or manipulate an opponent or
        its 장비, nor are they subject to such actions. Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not set off 함정
        that are triggered by weight.

      <p>
        An incorporeal creature 이동 silently and cannot be heard with 듣기 checks if it doesn’t 소원 to be. It has no
        근력 score, so its 민첩 수정치 applies to both its melee 공격 and its ranged 공격. Nonvisual senses, such as
        냄새 and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to incorporeal creatures.
        Incorporeal creatures have an innate sense of direction and can 이동 at full 속도 even when they cannot see.

        <span style="font-weight: 700">Natural 무기:</span
        ><span>
          Natural 무기 are 무기 that are physically a part of a creature. A creature making a melee 공격 with a natural
          weapon is considered armed and does not provoke 기회 공격. Likewise, it threatens any space it can reach.
          Creatures do not receive additional 공격 from a high base 공격 보너스 when using natural 무기. The number of
          공격 a creature can make with its natural 무기 depends on the type of 공격—generally, a creature can make
          one bite 공격, one 공격 per claw or tentacle, one gore 공격, one sting 공격, or one slam 공격(although Large
          creatures with arms or arm-like limbs can make a slam 공격 with each arm). Refer to the individual monster
          묘사.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>Unless otherwise noted, a natural weapon threatens a critical hit on a natural 명중 굴림 of 20.</p>
      <p>
        When a creature has more than one natural weapon, one of them (or sometimes a pair or set of them) is the
        primary weapon. All the creature’s remaining natural 무기 are secondary.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary weapon is given in the creature’s 공격 entry, and the primary weapon or 무기 is given first in the
        creature’s 전력 공격 entry. A creature’s primary natural weapon is its most effective natural 공격, usually by
        미덕 of the creature’s physiology, training, or innate talent with the weapon. An 공격 with a primary natural
        weapon uses the creature’s full 공격 보너스. 공격 with secondary natural 무기 are less effective and are made
        with a –5 페널티 on 명중 굴림, no matter how many there are. (Creatures with 다중공격 feat take only a
        –2 페널티 on secondary 공격.) This 페널티 applies even when the creature makes a single 공격 with the
        secondary weapon as part of 공격 action or as an 공격 of opportunity.
      </p>

        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, 거리
        increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong 냄새, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be
        detected at twice 거리 noted above. Overpowering 냄새, such as skunk musk or 트로글로다이트 stench, can be
        detected at triple normal 거리.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a creature detects a 냄새, the exact location of the source is not revealed—only its presence somewhere
        within 거리. The creature can take a 이동 action to note the direction of 냄새.
      </p>
      <p>Whenever the creature comes within 5 feet of the source, the creature pinpoints the source’s location.</p>
      <p>
        A creature with 추적 feat and 냄새 ability can follow 추적 by smell, making a 지혜(or 생존) check to
        find or follow a 추적. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds 냄새).
        This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures, and the
        나이 of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows
        the rules for 추적 feat. Creatures tracking by 냄새 ignore the effects of surface 상태이상 and poor
        visibility.

        ><span>
          Unless otherwise noted, a sonic 공격 follows the rules for spreads. 거리 of the spread is measured from
          the creature using the sonic 공격. Once a sonic 공격 has taken effect, deafening the subject or stopping its

        A spell-like ability usually has a limit on how often it can be used. A spell-like ability that can be used at
        will has no use limit. Using a spell-like ability is a standard action unless noted otherwise, and doing so
        while threatened provokes 기회 공격. It is possible to make a 집중 check to use a spell-like ability defensively
        and avoid provoking an 공격 of opportunity, just as when casting a spell. A spell-like ability can be disrupted
        just as a spell can be. Spell-like 능력 cannot be used to counterspell, nor can they be counterspelled.
      </p>
      <p>
        For creatures with spell-like 능력, a designated 시전자 레벨 defines how difficult it is to dispel their
        spell-like effects and to define any 레벨-dependent variables (such as 거리 and 지속시간) 능력 might have. The
        creature’s 시전자 레벨 never affects which spell-like 능력 the creature has; sometimes the given 시전자 레벨 is
        lower than 레벨 a spellcasting character would need to cast the spell of the same 이름. If no 시전자 레벨 is
        specified, 시전자 레벨 is equal to the creature’s 히트 다이스. 내성 굴림(if any) against a spell-like
        ability is 10 + 레벨 of the spell the ability resembles or duplicates + the creature’s Cha 수정치.

        A spellcasting creature that lacks hands or arms can provide any somatic component a spell might require by

        A spellcasting creature is not actually a member of a class unless its entry says so, and it does not gain any

          포인트, a single 선제권 수정치, a single 속도, and a single 방어도. A 무리 떼 makes 내성 굴림 as a single
          creature. A single 무리 떼 occupies a square (if it is made up of nonflying creatures) or a cube (of flying
          creatures) 10 feet on a side, but its reach is 0 feet, like its component creatures. In order to 공격, it 이동
          into an opponent’s space, which provokes an 공격 of opportunity. It can occupy the same space as a creature of
          any size, since it crawls all over its prey. A 무리 떼 can 이동 through squares occupied by enemies and vice
          versa without impediment, although 무리 떼 provokes an 공격 of opportunity if it does so. A 무리 떼 can

        many more creatures than could normally fit in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because creatures
        in a 무리 떼 are packed tightly together and generally crawl over each other and their prey when moving or

        When a note includes the word “only,” the creature goes out of its way to collect 전리품 of the indicated type.
        Treat all results from that column as the indicated type of 전리품.
