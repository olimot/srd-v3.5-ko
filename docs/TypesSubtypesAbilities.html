&amp; SPECIAL ABILITIES</div><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Aberration
Type:</span><span> An
aberration has a bizarre anatomy, strange 능력, an alien mindset, or any
combination of the three.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>An
aberration has the following features.</span></p><p>—d8
히트 다이스.</p><p>—Base
공격 보너스 equal to 3/4 total 히트 다이스 (as 사제).</p><p>—Good
Will 내성 굴림.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>An
aberration possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a
creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—암흑시야
out to 60 feet.</p><p>—Proficient
with its natural 무기. If generally humanoid in form, proficient with all
simple 무기 and any weapon it is described as using.</p><p>—Proficient
with whatever type of 갑옷 (빛, medium, or heavy) it is described as
wearing, as well as all lighter types. Aberrations not indicated as wearing
갑옷 are not proficient with 갑옷. Aberrations are proficient with 방패 if
they are proficient with any form of 갑옷.</p><p>—Aberrations
eat, 수면, and breathe.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">능력 점수 손실 (Su):</span><span>
Some 공격 reduce the opponent’s score in one or more 능력. This loss
can be temporary (ability 피해) or permanent (ability drain).</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ability
피해: </span><span>This
공격 피해 an opponent’s ability score. The creature’s 설명 문구
gives the ability and the amount of 피해. If an 공격 that causes ability
피해 scores a critical hit, it deals twice the indicated amount of 피해 (if
the 피해 is expressed as a die 거리, roll two 주사위). Ability 피해 returns
at the rate of 1 point per day for each affected ability.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ability
Drain: </span><span>This
effect permanently reduces a living opponent’s ability score when the creature
hits with a melee 공격. The creature’s 설명 문구 gives the ability and
the amount drained. If an 공격 that causes ability drain scores a critical
hit, it drains twice the indicated amount (if the 피해 is expressed as a die
거리, roll two 주사위). Unless otherwise specified in the creature’s
묘사, a draining creature gains 5 임시 히트 포인트 (10 on a critical
hit) whenever it drains an ability score no matter how many points it drains.
임시 히트 포인트 gained in this fashion last for a maximum of 1 hour.</span></p><p>Some
ability drain 공격 allow a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 draining creature’s
racial HD + draining creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the
creature’s 설명 문구). If no 내성 굴림 is mentioned, none is allowed.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Alternate
Form (Su):</span><span>
A creature with this special quality has the ability to assume one or more
specific alternate forms. This ability works much like the <span style="font-style: italic;">변이 </span>spell,
except that the creature is limited to the forms specified, and does not regain
any 히트 포인트 for changing its form. Assuming an alternate form results in the
following changes to the creature:</span></p><p>—The
creature retains the type and subtype of its original form. It gains the size
of its new form.</p><p>—The
creature loses the natural 무기, natural 갑옷, 이동 modes, and
extraordinary 특수 공격 of its original form.</p><p>—The
creature gains the natural 무기, natural 갑옷, 이동 modes, and extraordinary
특수 공격 of its new form.</p><p>—The
creature retains the 특성 of its original form. It does not gain
any 특성 of its new form.</p><p>—The
creature retains the spell-like 능력 and supernatural 공격 of its old
form (except for 브레스 무기 and 시선 공격). It does not gain the
spell-like 능력 or supernatural 공격 of its new form.</p><p>—The
creature gains the physical 능력 점수 (Str, Dex, Con) of its new form. It
retains the mental 능력 점수 (Int, Wis, Cha) of its original form.</p><p>—The
creature retains its 히트 포인트 and save bonuses, although its save modifiers
may change due to a change in 능력 점수.</p><p>—The
creature retains any spellcasting ability it had in its original form, although
it must be able to 말하기 intelligibly to cast 주문 with verbal 구성요소 and
it must have humanlike hands to cast 주문 with somatic 구성요소.</p><p>—The
creature is effectively camouflaged as a creature of its new form, and it gains
a +10 bonus on 변장 checks if it uses this ability to create a 변장.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Air
Subtype:</span><span>
This subtype usually is used for 정령 and outsiders with a connection to
the 정령 Plane Air. Air creatures always have 비행 속도 and usually have
perfect maneuverability.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">천사
Subtype:</span><span>
천사 are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to the good-aligned
Outer 이세계.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>An 천사
possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—암흑시야
out to 60 feet and 저광시야.</p><p>—Immunity
to acid, cold, and petrification.</p><p>—저항
to electricity 10 and fire 10.</p><p>—
+4 racial bonus on 내성 굴림 against 독.</p><p>—Protective
Aura (Su): Against 공격 made or effects created by evil creatures, <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span>his
ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 저항 bonus on
내성 굴림 to anyone within 20 feet of the 천사. Otherwise, it functions as
a <span style="font-style: italic;">악 방어 마법진 </span>effect and a <span style="font-style: italic;">하급 무적의 보주,
</span>both with a radius of 20 feet (시전자 레벨 equals 천사’s HD). (The
defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an 천사’s 수치 표.) </p><p>—통역마법
(Su): All 천사 can 말하기 with any creature that has a language, as though
using a <span style="font-style: italic;">통역마법 </span>spell (시전자 레벨 equal to 천사’s 히트 다이스). This
ability is always active.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Animal
Type:</span><span> An
animal is a living, nonhuman creature, usually a vertebrate with no magical
능력 and no innate capacity for language or culture.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>An animal
has the following features (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—d8
히트 다이스.</p><p>—Base
공격 보너스 equal to 3/4 total 히트 다이스 (as 사제).</p><p>—Good
Fortitude and Reflex 내성 굴림 (certain animals have different good 내성 굴림).</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>An animal
possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—지능
score of 1 or 2 (no creature with an 지능 score of 3 or higher can be
an animal).</p><p>—저광시야.</p><p>—성향:
Always neutral.</p><p>—전리품:
None.</p><p>—Proficient
with its natural 무기 only. A noncombative herbivore uses its natural
무기 as a secondary 공격. Such 공격 are made with a –5 penalty on the
creature’s 명중 굴림, and the animal receives only 1/2 its 근력 modifier
as a 피해 adjustment.</p><p>—Proficient
with no 갑옷 unless trained for war.</p><p>—Animals
eat, 수면, and breathe.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Aquatic
Subtype:</span><span>
These creatures always have 수영 속도 and thus can 이동 in water without
making 수영 checks. An aquatic creature can breathe underwater. It cannot also
breathe air unless it has the amphibious special quality. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">아콘
Subtype:</span><span>
아콘 are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to lawful
good-aligned Outer 이세계.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>An 아콘
possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—암흑시야
out to 60 feet and 저광시야.</p><p>—Aura
of Menace (Su): A righteous aura surrounds 아콘 that fight or get angry. Any
hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of an 아콘 must succeed on a Will
save to resist its effects. The save DC varies with the type of 아콘, is
매력-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. Those who fail take a –2
penalty on 공격, AC, and 내성 굴림 for 24 hours or until they successfully hit
the 아콘 that generated the aura. A creature that has resisted or broken the
effect cannot be affected again by the same 아콘’s aura for 24 hours.</p><p>—Immunity
to electricity and petrification.</p><p>—
+4 racial bonus on 내성 굴림 against 독.</p><p>—악 방어 마법진 (Su): A 악 방어 마법진 effect always surrounds
an 아콘 (시전자 레벨 equals the 아콘’s 히트 다이스). (The defensive benefits
from the circle are not included in an 아콘’s 수치 표.)</p><p>—순간이동
(Su): 아콘 can use 상급 순간이동 at will, as the spell (시전자 레벨
14th), except that the creature can 운송수단 only itself and up to 50 pounds
of objects.</p><p>—통역마법
(Su): All 아콘 can 말하기 with any creature that has a language, as though
using a <span style="font-style: italic;">통역마법 </span>spell (시전자 레벨 14th). This ability is always
active.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Augmented
Subtype:</span><span>
A creature receives this subtype whenever something happens to change its
original type. Some creatures (those with an inherited template) are born with
this subtype; others acquire it when they take on an acquired template. The
augmented subtype is always paired with the creature’s original type. A
creature with the augmented subtype usually has the traits of its current type,
but the features of its original type.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Blindsense
(Ex):</span><span>
Using nonvisual senses, such as acute smell or hearing, a creature with
blindsense notices things it cannot see. The creature usually does not need to
make 감지 or 듣기 checks to pinpoint the location of a creature within 거리
of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to that
creature. Any opponent the creature cannot see still has total 은폐
against the creature with blindsense, and the creature still has the normal
miss chance when attacking foes that have 은폐. Visibility still affects
the 이동 of a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still
denied its 민첩 bonus to 방어도 against 공격 from creatures it cannot
see.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Blindsight
(Ex):</span><span>
This ability is similar to blindsense, but is far more discerning. Using
nonvisual senses, such as sensitivity to vibrations, keen smell, acute hearing,
or echolocation, a creature with blindsight maneuvers and fights as well as a
sighted creature. 투명화, 암흑, and most kinds of 은폐 are
irrelevant, though the creature must have line of effect to a creature or
object to discern that creature or object. The ability’s 거리 is specified in
the creature’s 설명 문구. The creature usually does not need to make
감지 or 듣기 checks to notice creatures within 거리 of its blindsight
ability. Unless noted otherwise, blindsight is continuous, and the creature
need do nothing to use it. Some forms of blindsight, however, must be triggered
as a free action. If so, this is noted in the creature’s 묘사. If a
creature must 신관 its blindsight ability, the creature gains the benefits
of blindsight only during its turn.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">브레스 무기 (Su): </span><span>A
브레스 무기 공격 usually deals 피해 and is often based on some type of
energy.</span></p><p>Such
브레스 무기 allow a Reflex save for half 피해 (DC 10 + 1/2 breathing
creature’s racial HD + breathing creature’s Con modifier; the exact DC is given
in the creature’s 설명 문구). A creature is immune to its own 브레스 무기 unless otherwise noted. Some 브레스 무기 allow a Fortitude save or a
Will save instead of a Reflex save.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Change
Shape (Su):</span><span>
A creature with this special quality has the ability to assume the appearance
of a specific creature or type of creature (usually a humanoid), but retains
most of its own physical qualities. A creature cannot change shape to a form
more than one size category smaller or larger than its original form. Changing
shape results in the following changes to the creature:</span></p><p>—The
creature retains the type and subtype of its original form. It gains the size
of its new form.</p><p>—The
creature loses the natural 무기, 이동 modes, and extraordinary 특수 공격 of its original form.</p><p>—The
creature gains the natural 무기, 이동 modes, and extraordinary 특수 공격 of its new form.</p><p>—The
creature retains all other 특수 공격 and qualities of its original form,
except for 브레스 무기 and 시선 공격.</p><p>—The
creature retains the 능력 점수 of its original form.</p><p>—The
creature retains its 히트 포인트 and 내성 굴림.</p><p>—The
creature retains any spellcasting ability it had in its original form, although
it must be able to 말하기 intelligibly to cast 주문 with verbal 구성요소 and
it must have humanlike hands to cast 주문 with somatic 구성요소.</p><p>—The
creature is effectively camouflaged as a creature of its new form, and gains a
+10 bonus on 변장 checks if it uses this ability to create a 변장.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Chaotic
Subtype: </span><span>A
subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the chaotic-aligned Outer
이세계. Most creatures that have this subtype also have chaotic 성향;
however, if their 성향 change they still retain the subtype. Any effect
that depends on 성향 affects a creature with this subtype as if the
creature has a chaotic 성향, no matter what its 성향 actually is. The
creature also suffers effects according to its actual 성향. A creature
with the chaotic subtype overcomes 피해 축소 as if its natural 무기
and any 무기 it wields were chaotic-aligned (see 피해 축소, below).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Cold
Subtype: </span><span>A
creature with the cold subtype has immunity to cold. It has vulnerability to
fire, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) 피해 as normal from
fire, regardless of whether a 내성 굴림 is allowed, or if the save is a
success or failure. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Constrict
(Ex):</span><span> A
creature with this special 공격 can crush an opponent, dealing bludgeoning
피해, after making a successful 드잡이 check. The amount of 피해 is given
in the creature’s entry. If the creature also has the improved grab ability it
deals constriction 피해 in addition to 피해 dealt by the weapon used to
grab.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Construct
Type: </span><span>A
construct is an 살아 움직이는 물체 or artificially constructed creature.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>A
construct has the following features.</span></p><p>—10-sided
히트 다이스.</p><p>—Base
공격 보너스 equal to 3/4 total 히트 다이스 (as 사제).</p><p>—No
good 내성 굴림.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die, if the construct has an 지능 score.
However, most constructs are mindless and gain no skill points or 특기.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>A
construct possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a
creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—No
건강 score.</p><p>—저광시야.</p><p>—암흑시야
out to 60 feet.</p><p>—Immunity
to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and
morale effects).</p><p>—Immunity
to 독, 수면 effects, 마비, stunning, 질병 , death effects, and
강령술 effects.</p><p>—Cannot
치료 피해 on their own, but often can be repaired by exposing them to a
certain kind of effect (see the creature’s 묘사 for details) or through
the use of the 구조물 제작 feat. A construct with the 빠른 치료 special
quality still benefits from that quality.</p><p>—Not
subject to critical hits, 비치명적인 피해, ability 피해, ability drain,
fatigue, exhaustion, or 정령 흡수.</p><p>—Immunity
to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on
objects, or is harmless).</p><p>—Not
at risk of death from massive 피해. Immediately destroyed when reduced to 0
히트 포인트 or less.</p><p>—Since
it was never alive, a construct cannot be raised or resurrected.</p><p>—Because
its body is a 광역 of unliving matter, a construct is hard to destroy. It gains
bonus 히트 포인트 based on size, as shown on the following table.</p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 29.7001em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Construct

most 무기 and natural 공격. Wounds 치료 immediately, or the weapon
bounces off harmlessly (in either case, the opponent knows the 공격 was
ineffective). The creature takes normal 피해 from energy 공격 (even
nonmagical ones), 주문, spell-like 능력, and supernatural 능력. A
certain kind of weapon can sometimes 피해 the creature normally, as noted
below.</span></p><p>The

adamantine, or cold-forged iron. 공격 from 무기 that are not made of the

enhancement bonus.</p><p>Some
몬스터 are vulnerable to 마법 무기. Any weapon with at least a +1 magical

few very powerful 몬스터 are vulnerable only to 에픽 무기; that is, 마법 무기 with at least a +6 enhancement bonus. Such creatures’ natural 무기
are also treated as 에픽 무기 for the 목적 of overcoming 피해 축소.</p><p>Some
몬스터 are vulnerable to chaotic-, evil-, good-, or lawful-aligned 무기.
When a 사제 casts <span style="font-style: italic;">무기 성향 지정, </span>affected 무기 might gain one or
more of these properties, and certain 마법 무기 have these properties as
well. A creature with an 성향 subtype (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) can
overcome this type of 피해 축소 with its natural 무기 and 무기 it
wields as if the 무기 or natural 무기 had an 성향 (or 성향)
that match the subtype(s) of the creature. </p><p>When
a 피해 축소 entry has a dash (–) after the slash, no weapon negates the
피해 축소.</p><p>A
few creatures are harmed by more than one kind of weapon. A weapon of either
type overcomes this 피해 축소.</p><p>A
few other creatures require combinations of different types of 공격 to
overcome their 피해 축소. A weapon must be both types to overcome this
피해 축소. A weapon that is only one type is still subject to 피해 축소.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">드래곤
Type:</span><span> A
드래곤 is a reptilelike creature, usually winged, with magical or unusual
능력.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>A 드래곤
has the following features.</span></p><p>—12-sided
히트 다이스.</p><p>—Base
공격 보너스 equal to total 히트 다이스 (as 전사).</p><p>—Good
Fortitude, Reflex, and Will 내성 굴림.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (6 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>A 드래곤

with no 갑옷.</p><p>—드래곤
eat, 수면, and breathe.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Earth
Subtype:</span><span>
This subtype usually is used for 정령 and outsiders with a connection to
the 땅 정령 세계. Earth creatures usually have burrow 속도, and
most earth creatures can burrow through solid rock.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">정령
Type:</span><span> An
정령 is a being composed of one of the four classical elements: air,
earth, fire, or water.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>An
정령 has the following features.</span></p><p>—8-sided
히트 다이스.</p><p>—Base
공격 보너스 equal to 3/4 total 히트 다이스 (as 사제).</p><p>—Good
내성 굴림 depend on the element: Fortitude (earth, water) or Reflex (air, fire).</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill

</span><span>An
정령 possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a
creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—암흑시야
out to 60 feet.</p><p>—Immunity
to 독, 수면 effects, 마비, and stunning.</p><p>—Not
subject to critical hits or 협공.</p><p>—Unlike
most other living creatures, an 정령 does not have a dual nature—its soul
and body form one unit. When an 정령 is slain, no soul is set loose.
주문 that restore souls to their bodies, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">시체 되살리기, 환생, </span>and
<span style="font-style: italic;">부활, </span>don’t work on an 정령. It takes a different magical
effect, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">제한된 소원, 소원, 기적, </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">진정한 부활, </span>to
restore it to life.</p><p>—Proficient
with natural 무기 only, unless generally humanoid in form, in which case
proficient with all simple 무기 and any 무기 mentioned in its entry.</p><p>—Proficient
with whatever type of 갑옷 (빛, medium, or heavy) that it is described as
wearing, as well as all lighter types. 정령 not indicated as wearing
갑옷 are not proficient with 갑옷. 정령 are proficient with 방패 if
they are proficient with any form of 갑옷.</p><p>—정령
do not eat, 수면, or breathe.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">정령 흡수 (Su):</span><span>
This 공격 saps a living opponent’s vital energy and happens automatically
when a melee or ranged 공격 hits. Each successful 정령 흡수 bestows one or
more negative 레벨 (the creature’s 묘사 specifies how many). If an
공격 that includes an 정령 흡수 scores a critical hit, it drains twice the
given amount. Unless otherwise specified in the creature’s 묘사, a
draining creature gains 5 임시 히트 포인트 (10 on a critical hit) for each
negative 레벨 it bestows on an opponent. These 임시 히트 포인트 last for a
maximum of 1 hour. An affected opponent takes a –1 penalty on all 스킬 판정
and 능력 판정, 명중 굴림, and 내성 굴림, and loses one effective
레벨 or Hit Die (whenever 레벨 is used in a die roll or calculation) for each
negative 레벨. A spellcaster loses one spell slot of the highest 레벨 of
주문 she can cast and (if applicable) one prepared spell of that 레벨; this
loss persists until the negative 레벨 is removed. Negative 레벨 remain until
24 hours have passed or until they are removed with a spell, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">복원</span>.
If a negative 레벨 is not removed before 24 hours have passed, the affected
creature must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 draining creature’s racial
HD + draining creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s
설명 문구). On a success, the negative 레벨 goes away with no 해악 to
the creature. On a failure, the negative 레벨 goes away, but the creature’s
레벨 is also reduced by one. A separate 내성 굴림 is required for each
negative 레벨.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Evil
Subtype: </span><span>A
subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the evil-aligned Outer
이세계. Evil outsiders are also called fiends. Most creatures that have this
subtype also have evil 성향; however, if their 성향 change, they
still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on 성향 affects a
creature with this subtype as if the creature has an evil 성향, no matter
what its 성향 actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to
its actual 성향. A creature with the evil subtype overcomes 피해 축소 as if its natural 무기 and any 무기 it wields were evil-aligned
(see 피해 축소, above).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Extraplanar
Subtype:</span><span>
A subtype applied to any creature when it is on a plane other than its native plane.
A creature that travels the 이세계 can gain or lose this subtype as it goes
from plane to plane. Monster entries assume that encounters with creatures take
place on 물질 세계, and every creature whose native plane is not 물질 세계 has the extraplanar subtype (but would not have when on its home
plane). Every extraplanar creature in this book has a home plane mentioned in
its 묘사. Creatures not labeled as extraplanar are natives of 물질 세계, and they gain the extraplanar subtype if they leave 물질 세계. No creature has the extraplanar subtype when it is on a
transitive plane, such as 영적 세계, 에테리얼 세계, and the 어둠의 세계.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">빠른 치료 (Ex):</span><span>
A creature with the 빠른 치료 special quality regains 히트 포인트 at an
exceptionally fast rate, usually 1 or more 히트 포인트 per round, as given in
the creature’s entry. Except where noted here, 빠른 치료 is just like
natural 치료. 빠른 치료 does not restore 히트 포인트 lost from starvation,
thirst, or 질식, and it does not allow a creature to regrow lost body
parts. Unless otherwise stated, it does not allow lost body parts to be
reattached.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">공포
(Su or Sp):</span><span>
공포 공격 can have various effects.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">공포
Aura (Su): </span><span>The
use of this ability is a free action. The aura can freeze an opponent (such as
a 미라’s despair) or function like the <span style="font-style: italic;">공포 </span>spell. Other effects are
possible. A 공포 aura is an 범위 effect. The 설명 문구 gives the size
and kind of 범위.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">공포
Cones (Sp) and 광선 (Su): </span><span>These effects usually work like the <span style="font-style: italic;">공포 </span>spell. </span></p><p>If
a 공포 effect allows a 내성 굴림, it is a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 fearsome
creature’s racial HD + creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the
creature’s 설명 문구). All 공포 공격 are mind-affecting 공포 effects.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Fey
Type:</span><span> A
fey is a creature with supernatural 능력 and connections to nature or to
some other force or place. Fey are usually human-shaped.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>A fey has
the following features.</span></p><p>—6-sided
히트 다이스.</p><p>—Base
공격 보너스 equal to 1/2 total 히트 다이스 (as 마법사).</p><p>—Good
Reflex and Will 내성 굴림.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (6 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>A fey
possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—저광시야.</p><p>—Proficient
with all simple 무기 and any 무기 mentioned in its entry.</p><p>—Proficient
with whatever type of 갑옷 (빛, medium, or heavy) that it is described as
wearing, as well as all lighter types. Fey not indicated as wearing 갑옷 are
not proficient with 갑옷. Fey are proficient with 방패 if they are
proficient with any form of 갑옷.</p><p>—Fey
eat, 수면, and breathe.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Fire
Subtype:</span><span>
A creature with the fire subtype has immunity to fire. It has vulnerability to
cold, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) 피해 as normal from
cold, regardless of whether a 내성 굴림 is allowed, or if the save is a
success or failure.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Flight
(Ex or Su):</span><span>
A creature with this ability can cease or resume flight as a free action. If
the ability is supernatural, it becomes ineffective in an 대마법 보호장, and
the creature loses its ability to 비행 for as long as the 항마 effect
persists.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">끔찍한 존재 (Ex):</span><span>
This special quality makes a creature’s very presence unsettling to foes. It
takes effect automatically when the creature 공연 some sort of dramatic
action (such as charging, attacking, or snarling). Opponents within 거리 who
witness the action may become frightened or shaken. Actions required to 신관
the ability are given in the creature’s 설명 문구. The 거리 is usually
30 feet, and the 지속시간 is usually 5d6 rounds. This ability affects only
opponents with fewer 히트 다이스 or 레벨 than the creature has. An affected
opponent can resist the effects with a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2
frightful creature’s racial HD + frightful creature’s Cha modifier; the exact
DC is given in the creature’s 설명 문구). An opponent that succeeds on
the 내성 굴림 is immune to that same creature’s 끔찍한 존재 for 24
hours. 끔찍한 존재 is a mind-affecting 공포 effect. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Gaze
(Su):</span><span> A
gaze special 공격 takes effect when opponents look at the creature’s eyes.
The 공격 can have almost any sort of effect: petrification, death, charm, and
so on. The typical 거리 is 30 feet, but check the creature’s entry for
details. The type of 내성 굴림 for a gaze 공격 varies, but it is usually a
Will or Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 gazing creature’s racial HD + gazing
creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s 설명 문구). A successful 내성 굴림 negates the effect. A monster’s gaze 공격 is
described in abbreviated form in its 묘사. Each opponent within 거리 of
a gaze 공격 must attempt a 내성 굴림 each round at the beginning of his or
her turn in the 선제권 order. Only looking directly at a creature with a
gaze 공격 leaves an opponent vulnerable. Opponents can avoid the need to make
the 내성 굴림 by not looking at the creature, in one of two ways. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Averting
Eyes: </span><span>The
opponent avoids looking at the creature’s face, instead looking at its body,
watching its 어둠, tracking it in a reflective surface, and so on. Each
round, the opponent has a 50% chance to not need to make a 내성 굴림 against
the gaze 공격. The creature with the gaze 공격, however, gains 은폐
against that opponent.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Wearing
a Blindfold: </span><span>The
opponent cannot see the creature at all (also possible to achieve by turning
one’s back on the creature or shutting one’s eyes). The creature with the gaze
공격 gains total 은폐 against the opponent. </span></p><p>A
creature with a gaze 공격 can actively gaze as an 공격 action by choosing a
target within 거리. That opponent must attempt a 내성 굴림 but can try to
avoid this as described above. Thus, it is possible for an opponent to save
against a creature’s gaze twice during the same round, once before the
opponent’s action and once during the creature’s turn. </p><p>시선 공격 can affect ethereal opponents. A creature is immune to 시선 공격 of
others of its kind unless otherwise noted.</p><p>Allies
of a creature with a gaze 공격 might be affected. All the creature’s allies
are considered to be averting their eyes from the creature with the gaze
공격, and have a 50% chance to not need to make a 내성 굴림 against the
gaze 공격 each round. The creature also can 가리개 its eyes, thus negating its
gaze ability.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">거인
Type:</span><span> A
거인 is a humanoid-shaped creature of 상급 근력, usually of at least
Large size.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>A 거인
has the following features.</span></p><p>—8-sided
히트 다이스.</p><p>—Base
공격 보너스 equal to 3/4 total 히트 다이스 (as 사제).</p><p>—Good
Fortitude 내성 굴림.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>A 거인
possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—저광시야.</p><p>—Proficient
with all simple and martial 무기, as well as any natural 무기.</p><p>—Proficient
with whatever type of 갑옷 (빛, medium or heavy) it is described as
wearing, as well as all lighter types. 거인 not described as wearing 갑옷
are not proficient with 갑옷. 거인 are proficient with 방패 if they are
proficient with any form of 갑옷.</p><p>—거인
eat, 수면, and breathe.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Goblinoid
Subtype:</span><span>
Goblinoids are 은신 humanoids who live by hunting and raiding and who all
말하기 고블린.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Good
Subtype:</span><span>
A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the good-aligned Outer
이세계. Most creatures that have this subtype also have good 성향;
however, if their 성향 change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect
that depends on 성향 affects a creature with this subtype as if the
creature has a good 성향, no matter what its 성향 actually is. The
creature also suffers effects according to its actual 성향. A creature
with the good subtype overcomes 피해 축소 as if its natural 무기 and
any 무기 it wields were good-aligned (see 피해 축소, above).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Humanoid
Type: </span><span>A
humanoid usually has two arms, two legs, and one head, or a humanlike torso,
arms, and a head. Humanoids have few or no supernatural or extraordinary
능력, but most can 말하기 and usually have well-developed societies. They
usually are Small or Medium. Every humanoid creature also has a subtype.</span></p><p>Humanoids
with 1 Hit Die exchange the features of their humanoid Hit Die for the 직업 특성 of a PC or NPC class. Humanoids of this sort are presented as
1st-레벨 군인, which means that they have average 전투 ability and poor
내성 굴림.</p><p>Humanoids
with more than 1 Hit Die are the only humanoids who make use of the features of
the humanoid type.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>A
humanoid has the following features (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s
entry).</span></p><p>—8-sided
히트 다이스, or by character class.</p><p>—Base
공격 보너스 equal to 3/4 total 히트 다이스 (as 사제).</p><p>—Good
Reflex 내성 굴림 (usually; a humanoid’s good save varies).</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die, or by character class.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>A
humanoid possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s
entry).</span></p><p>—Proficient
with all simple 무기, or by character class.</p><p>—Proficient
with whatever type of 갑옷 (빛, medium, or heavy) it is described as
wearing, or by character class. If a humanoid does not have a class and wears
갑옷, it is proficient with that type of 갑옷 and all lighter types.
Humanoids not indicated as wearing 갑옷 are not proficient with 갑옷.
Humanoids are proficient with 방패 if they are proficient with any form of
갑옷.</p><p>—Humanoids
breathe, eat, and 수면.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Improved
Grab (Ex):</span><span>
If a creature with this special 공격 hits with a melee weapon (usually a claw
or bite 공격), it deals normal 피해 and attempts to start a 드잡이 as a
free action without provoking an 공격 of opportunity. No initial touch 공격
is required. Unless otherwise noted, improved grab works only against opponents
at least one size category smaller than the creature. The creature has the
option to conduct the 드잡이 normally, or simply use the part of its body it
used in the improved grab to hold the opponent. If it chooses to do the latter,
it takes a –20 penalty on 드잡이 checks, but is not considered grappled
itself; the creature does not lose its 민첩 bonus to AC, still threatens
an 범위, and can use its remaining 공격 against other opponents. A
successful hold does not deal any extra 피해 unless the creature also has the
constrict special 공격. If the creature does not constrict, each successful
드잡이 check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the 피해
indicated for the 공격 that established the hold. Otherwise, it deals
constriction 피해 as well (the amount is given in the creature’s 설명 문구). When a creature gets a hold after an improved grab 공격, it pulls the
opponent into its space. This act does not provoke 기회 공격. It can
even 이동 (possibly carrying away the opponent), provided it can drag the
opponent’s weight. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Incorporeal
Subtype:</span><span>
An incorporeal creature has no physical body. It can be harmed only by other
incorporeal creatures, 마법 무기 or creatures that strike as 마법 무기,
and 주문, spell-like 능력, or supernatural 능력. It is immune to
all nonmagical 공격 forms. Even when hit by 주문 or 마법 무기, it has a
50% chance to ignore any 피해 from a corporeal source (except for positive energy,
negative energy, force effects such as <span style="font-style: italic;">마법 화살, </span>or 공격 made
with <span style="font-style: italic;">유령 touch </span>무기). Although it is not a magical 공격, holy
water can affect incorporeal undead, but a hit with holy water has a 50% chance
of not affecting an incorporeal creature.</span></p><p>An
incorporeal creature has no natural 갑옷 bonus but has a deflection bonus
equal to its 매력 bonus (always at least +1, even if the creature’s
매력 score does not normally provide a bonus). </p><p>An
incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid objects, but must remain
adjacent to the object’s exterior, and so cannot pass entirely through an
object whose space is larger than its own. It can sense the presence of
creatures or objects within a square adjacent to its current location, but
enemies have total 은폐 (50% miss chance) from an incorporeal creature
that is inside an object. In order to see farther from the object it is in and
공격 normally, the incorporeal creature must emerge. An incorporeal creature
inside an object has total 엄폐, but when it 공격 a creature outside the
object it only has 엄폐, so a creature outside with a readied action could
strike at it as it 공격. An incorporeal creature cannot pass through a force
effect.</p><p>An
incorporeal creature’s 공격 pass through (ignore) natural 갑옷, 갑옷, and
방패, although deflection bonuses and force effects (such as <span style="font-style: italic;">마법사의 갑옷</span>)
work normally against it. Incorporeal creatures pass through and operate in
water as easily as they do in air. Incorporeal creatures cannot fall or take
낙하 피해. Incorporeal creatures cannot make 넘어뜨리기 or 드잡이 공격, nor
can they be tripped or grappled. In fact, they cannot take any physical action
that would 이동 or manipulate an opponent or its 장비, nor are they subject
to such actions. Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not set off 함정
that are triggered by weight.</p><p>An
incorporeal creature 이동 silently and cannot be heard with 듣기 checks if
it doesn’t 소원 to be. It has no 근력 score, so its 민첩 modifier
applies to both its melee 공격 and its ranged 공격. Nonvisual senses,
such as 냄새 and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly effective
with regard to incorporeal creatures. Incorporeal creatures have an innate
sense of direction and can 이동 at full 속도 even when they cannot see.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Lawful:
</span><span>A subtype
usually applied only to outsiders native to the lawful-aligned Outer 이세계.
Most creatures that have this subtype also have lawful 성향; however, if
their 성향 change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends
on 성향 affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has a
lawful 성향, no matter what its 성향 actually is. The creature also
suffers effects according to its actual 성향. A creature with the lawful
subtype overcomes 피해 축소 as if its natural 무기 and any 무기 it
wields were lawful-aligned (see 피해 축소, above).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">저광시야 (Ex):</span><span>
A creature with 저광시야 can see twice as far as a human in starlight,
moonlight, torchlight, and similar 상태이상 of shadowy illumination. It
retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these 상태이상.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Magical
Beast Type:</span><span>
Magical beasts are similar to animals but can have 지능 scores higher
than 2. Magical beasts usually have supernatural or extraordinary 능력,
but sometimes are merely bizarre in appearance or habits.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>A magical
beast has the following features.</span></p><p>—10-sided
히트 다이스.</p><p>—Base
공격 보너스 equal to total 히트 다이스 (as 전사).</p><p>—Good
Fortitude and Reflex 내성 굴림.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>A magical
beast possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s
entry).</span></p><p>—암흑시야
out to 60 feet and 저광시야.</p><p>—Proficient
with its natural 무기 only.</p><p>—Proficient
with no 갑옷.</p><p>—Magical
beasts eat, 수면, and breathe.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Manufactured
무기:</span><span> Some 몬스터
employ manufactured 무기 when they 공격. Creatures that use swords, bows,
spears, and the like follow the same rules as characters, including those for
additional 공격 from a high base 공격 보너스 and 쌍수 무기 전투술
penalties. This category also includes “found items,” such as rocks and logs,
that a creature wields in 전투— in essence, any weapon that is not intrinsic
to the creature.</span></p><p>Some creatures
combine 공격 with natural and manufactured 무기 when they make a 전력 공격. When they do so, the manufactured weapon 공격 is considered the
primary 공격 unless the creature’s 묘사 indicates otherwise and any
natural 무기 the creature also uses are considered secondary natural
공격. These secondary 공격 do not interfere with the primary 공격 as
attacking with an off-hand weapon does, but they take the usual –5 penalty (or
–2 with the 다중공격 feat) for such 공격, even if the natural weapon used
is normally the creature’s primary natural weapon.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Monstrous
Humanoid Type: </span><span>Monstrous
humanoids are similar to humanoids, but with monstrous or animalistic features.
They often have magical 능력 as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>A
monstrous humanoid has the following features.</span></p><p>—8-sided
히트 다이스.</p><p>—Base
공격 보너스 equal to total 히트 다이스 (as 전사).</p><p>—Good
Reflex and Will 내성 굴림.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>A
monstrous humanoid possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a
creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—암흑시야
out to 60 feet.</p><p>—Proficient
with all simple 무기 and any 무기 mentioned in its entry.</p><p>—Proficient
with whatever type of 갑옷 (빛, medium, or heavy) it is described as
wearing, as well as all lighter types. Monstrous humanoids not indicated as
wearing 갑옷 are not proficient with 갑옷. Monstrous humanoids are proficient
with 방패 if they are proficient with any form of 갑옷.</p><p>—Monstrous
humanoids eat, 수면, and breathe.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">이동
Modes: </span><span>Creatures
may have modes of 이동 other than walking and running. These are natural,
not magical, unless specifically noted in a monster 묘사.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Burrow:
</span><span>A
creature with a burrow 속도 can tunnel through dirt, but not through rock
unless the 설명 문구 says otherwise. Creatures cannot 돌격 or 달리기
while burrowing. Most burrowing creatures do not leave behind tunnels other
creatures can use (either because the material they tunnel through fills in
behind them or because they do not actually dislocate any material when
burrowing); see the individual creature 묘사 for details.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">등반:
</span><span>A
creature with a 등반 속도 has a +8 racial bonus on all 등반 checks. The
creature must make a 등반 check to 등반 any wall or slope with a DC of more
than 0, but it always can choose to take 10 even if rushed or threatened while
climbing. The creature 등반 at the given 속도 while climbing. If it chooses
an accelerated 등반 it 이동 at double the given 등반 속도 (or its base land
속도, whichever is lower) and makes a single 등반 check at a –5 penalty.
Creatures cannot 달리기 while climbing. A creature retains its 민첩 bonus to
방어도 (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus on
their 공격 against a climbing creature.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">비행:
</span><span>A
creature with a 비행 속도 can 이동 through the air at the indicated 속도 if
carrying no more than a 빛 load. (Note that medium 갑옷 does not
necessarily constitute a medium load.) All 비행 속도 include a parenthetical
note indicating maneuverability, as follows:</span></p><p>—Perfect:
The creature can 공연 almost any aerial maneuver it 소원. It 이동 through
the air as well as a human 이동 over smooth ground.</p><p>—Good:
The creature is very 재빠름 in the air (like a housefly or a hummingbird), but
cannot change direction as readily as those with perfect maneuverability.</p><p>—Average:
The creature can 비행 as adroitly as a small bird. </p><p>—Poor:
The creature flies as well as a very large bird.</p><p>—Clumsy:
The creature can barely maneuver at all.</p><p>A
creature that flies can make dive 공격. A dive 공격 works just like a
돌격, but the diving creature must 이동 a minimum of 30 feet and descend at
least 10 feet. It can make only claw or talon 공격, but these deal double
피해. A creature can use the 달리기 action while flying, provided it flies in a
straight line. </p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">수영:
</span><span>A
creature with a 수영 속도 can 이동 through water at its 수영 속도 without
making 수영 checks. It has a +8 racial bonus on any 수영 check to 공연 some
special action or avoid a hazard. The creature can always can choose to take 10
on a 수영 check, even if distracted or endangered. The creature can use the 달리기
action while swimming, provided it 수영 in a straight line. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Native
Subtype:</span><span>
A subtype applied only to outsiders. These creatures have mortal ancestors or a
strong connection to 물질 세계 and can be raised, reincarnated, or
resurrected just as other living creatures can be. Creatures with this subtype
are native to 물질 세계 (hence the subtype’s 이름). Unlike true
outsiders, native outsiders need to eat and 수면. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Natural
무기:</span><span>
Natural 무기 are 무기 that are physically a part of a creature. A
creature making a melee 공격 with a natural weapon is considered armed and
does not provoke 기회 공격. Likewise, it threatens any space it
can reach. Creatures do not receive additional 공격 from a high base 공격 보너스 when using natural 무기. The number of 공격 a creature can make
with its natural 무기 depends on the type of the 공격—generally, a
creature can make one bite 공격, one 공격 per claw or tentacle, one gore
공격, one sting 공격, or one slam 공격 (although Large creatures with
arms or arm-like limbs can make a slam 공격 with each arm). Refer to the
individual monster 묘사.</span></p><p>Unless
otherwise noted, a natural weapon threatens a critical hit on a natural 명중 굴림 of 20.</p><p>When
a creature has more than one natural weapon, one of them (or sometimes a pair
or set of them) is the primary weapon. All the creature’s remaining natural
무기 are secondary. </p><p>The
primary weapon is given in the creature’s 공격 entry, and the primary weapon
or 무기 is given first in the creature’s 전력 공격 entry. A creature’s
primary natural weapon is its most effective natural 공격, usually by 미덕
of the creature’s physiology, training, or innate talent with the weapon. An
공격 with a primary natural weapon uses the creature’s full 공격 보너스.
공격 with secondary natural 무기 are less effective and are made with a
–5 penalty on the 명중 굴림, no matter how many there are. (Creatures with
the 다중공격 feat take only a –2 penalty on secondary 공격.) This penalty
applies even when the creature makes a single 공격 with the secondary weapon
as part of the 공격 action or as an 공격 of opportunity.</p><p>Natural
무기 have types just as other 무기 do. The most common are summarized
below.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Bite:
</span><span>The
creature 공격 with its mouth, dealing piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning
피해.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Claw
or Talon: </span><span>The
creature rips with a sharp appendage, dealing piercing and slashing 피해.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Gore:
</span><span>The
creature spears the opponent with an antler, horn, or similar appendage,
dealing piercing 피해.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Slap
or Slam: </span><span>The
creature batters opponents with an appendage, dealing bludgeoning 피해.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sting:
</span><span>The
creature stabs with a stinger, dealing piercing 피해. Sting 공격 usually
deal 피해 from 독 in addition to hit point 피해.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Tentacle:
</span><span>The
creature flails at opponents with a powerful tentacle, dealing bludgeoning (and
sometimes slashing) 피해. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Nonabilities:</span><span> Some creatures lack
certain 능력 점수. These creatures do not have an ability score of 0—they
lack the ability altogether. The modifier for a nonability is +0. Other effects
of nonabilities are detailed below.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">근력:
</span><span>Any
creature that can physically manipulate other objects has at least 1 point of
근력. A creature with no 근력 score can’t exert force, usually because
it has no physical body or because it doesn’t 이동. The creature automatically
fails 근력 checks. If the creature can 공격, it applies its 민첩
modifier to its base 공격 보너스 instead of a 근력 modifier.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">민첩:
</span><span>Any
creature that can 이동 has at least 1 point of 민첩. A creature with no
민첩 score can’t 이동. If it can 공연 actions (such as 주문 시전하기),
it applies its 지능 modifier to 선제권 checks instead of a
민첩 modifier. The creature automatically fails Reflex 내성 굴림 and 민첩
checks.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">건강:
</span><span>Any
living creature has at least 1 point of 건강. A creature with no
건강 has no body or no metabolism. It is immune to any effect that
requires a Fortitude save unless the effect works on objects or is harmless. The
creature is also immune to ability 피해, ability drain, and 정령 흡수, and
automatically fails 건강 checks. A creature with no 건강 cannot
tire and thus can 달리기 indefinitely without tiring (unless the creature’s
묘사 says it cannot 달리기).</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">지능:
</span><span>Any
creature that can think, learn, or remember has at least 1 point of
지능. A creature with no 지능 score is mindless, an automaton
operating on simple instincts or programmed instructions. It has immunity to mind-affecting
effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) and
automatically fails 지능 checks.</span></p><p>Mindless
creatures do not gain 특기 or 스킬, although they may have bonus 특기 or
racial skill bonuses.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">지혜:
</span><span>Any
creature that can perceive its 환경 in any fashion has at least 1 point
of 지혜. Anything with no 지혜 score is an object, not a creature. Anything
without a 지혜 score also has no 매력 score.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">매력:
</span><span>Any
creature capable of telling the difference between itself and things that are
not itself has at least 1 point of 매력. Anything with no 매력 score is
an object, not a creature. Anything without a 매력 score also has no 지혜
score.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">늪괴물
Type:</span><span> An
늪괴물 is an amorphous or mutable creature, usually mindless.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>An 늪괴물
has the following features.</span></p><p>—10-sided
히트 다이스.</p><p>—Base
공격 보너스 equal to 3/4 total 히트 다이스 (as 사제).</p><p>—No
good 내성 굴림.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die, if the 늪괴물 has an 지능 score. However,
most 늪괴물 are mindless and gain no skill points or 특기.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>An 늪괴물
possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—Mindless:
No 지능 score, and immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms,
compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).</p><p>—Blind
(but have the blindsight special quality), with immunity to 시선 공격,
visual effects, 환상, and other 공격 forms that rely on sight.</p><p>—Immunity
to 독, 수면 effects, 마비, 변이, and stunning.</p><p>—Some
늪괴물 have the ability to deal acid 피해 to objects. In such a case, the
amount of 피해 is equal to 10 + 1/2 늪괴물’s HD + 늪괴물’s Con modifier per full
round of contact.</p><p>—Not
subject to critical hits or 협공.</p><p>—Proficient
with its natural 무기 only.</p><p>—Proficient
with no 갑옷.</p><p>—늪괴물
eat and breathe, but do not 수면.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Outsider
Type: </span><span>An
outsider is at least partially composed of the essence (but not necessarily the
material) of some plane other than 물질 세계. Some creatures start out
as some other type and become outsiders when they attain a higher (or lower)
state of spiritual existence.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>An
outsider has the following features.</span></p><p>—8-sided
히트 다이스.</p><p>—Base
공격 보너스 equal to total 히트 다이스 (as 전사).</p><p>—Good
Fortitude, Reflex, and Will 내성 굴림.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (8 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>An
outsider possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s
entry).</span></p><p>—암흑시야
out to 60 feet.</p><p>—Unlike
most other living creatures, an outsider does not have a dual nature—its soul
and body form one unit. When an outsider is slain, no soul is set loose. 주문
that restore souls to their bodies, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">시체 되살리기, 환생, </span>and
<span style="font-style: italic;">부활, </span>don’t work on an outsider. It takes a different magical
effect, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">제한된 소원, 소원, 기적, </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">진정한 부활 </span>to
restore it to life. An outsider with the native subtype can be raised,
reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living creatures can be.</p><p>—Proficient
with all simple and martial 무기 and any 무기 mentioned in its entry.</p><p>—Proficient
with whatever type of 갑옷 (빛, medium, or heavy) it is described as
wearing, as well as all lighter types. Outsiders not indicated as wearing 갑옷
are not proficient with 갑옷. Outsiders are proficient with 방패 if they
are proficient with any form of 갑옷.</p><p>—Outsiders
breathe, but do not need to eat or 수면 (although they can do so if they
소원). Native outsiders breathe, eat, and 수면. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">마비
(Ex or Su): </span><span>This
special 공격 renders the victim immobile. Paralyzed creatures cannot 이동,
말하기, or take any physical actions. The creature is rooted to the 감지, frozen
and helpless. 마비 works on the body, and a character can usually resist
it with a Fortitude 내성 굴림 (the DC is given in the creature’s
묘사). Unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">인간형 포박 </span>and similar effects, a 마비 effect
does not allow a new save each round. A winged creature flying in the air at
the time that it is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can’t
수영 and may drown. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Plant
Type:</span><span>
This type comprises vegetable creatures. Note that regular plants, such as one
finds growing in gardens and fields, lack 지혜 and 매력 scores (see
Nonabilities, above) and are not creatures, but objects, even though they are
alive. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>A plant
creature has the following features. </span></p><p>—8-sided
히트 다이스.</p><p>—Base
공격 보너스 equal to 3/4 total 히트 다이스 (as 사제).</p><p>—Good
Fortitude 내성 굴림.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die, if the plant creature has an 지능 score.
However, some plant creatures are mindless and gain no skill points or 특기.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>A plant
creature possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s
entry).</span></p><p>—저광시야.</p><p>—Immunity
to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and
morale effects).</p><p>—Immunity
to 독, 수면 effects, 마비, 변이, and stunning.</p><p>—Not
subject to critical hits.</p><p>—Proficient
with its natural 무기 only.</p><p>—Proficient
with no 갑옷.</p><p>—Plants
breathe and eat, but do not 수면.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">독
(Ex):</span><span>
독 공격 deal initial 피해, such as ability 피해 (see page 305) or
some other effect, to the opponent on a failed Fortitude save. Unless otherwise
noted, another 내성 굴림 is required 1 minute later (regardless of the first
save’s result) to avoid secondary 피해. A creature’s 설명 문구
provides the details.</span></p><p>A
creature with a 독 공격 is immune to its own 독 and the 독 of
others of its kind.</p><p>The
Fortitude save DC against a 독 공격 is equal to 10 + 1/2 poisoning
creature’s racial HD + poisoning creature’s Con modifier (the exact DC is given
in the creature’s 설명 문구).</p><p>A
successful save avoids (negates) the 피해.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Pounce
(Ex):</span><span>
When a creature with this special 공격 makes a 돌격, it can follow with a
전력 공격—including rake 공격 if the creature also has the rake ability.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Powerful
돌격 (Ex):</span><span>
When a creature with this special 공격 makes a 돌격, its 공격 deals extra
피해 in addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a 돌격. The amount
of 피해 from the 공격 is given in the creature’s 묘사.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">사이오닉
(Sp):</span><span>
These are spell-like 능력 that a creature generates with the power of its
mind. Psionic 능력 are usually usable at will.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Rake
(Ex):</span><span> A
creature with this special 공격 gains extra natural 공격 when it 드잡이
its foe. Normally, a monster can 공격 with only one of its natural 무기
while grappling, but a monster with the rake ability usually gains two
additional claw 공격 that it can use only against a grappled foe. Rake
공격 are not subject to the usual –4 penalty for attacking with a natural
weapon in a 드잡이.</span></p><p>A
monster with the rake ability must begin its turn grappling to use its rake—it
can’t begin a 드잡이 and rake in the same turn.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Ray
(Su or Sp):</span><span>
This form of special 공격 works like a ranged 공격. Hitting with a ray
공격 requires a successful ranged touch 명중 굴림, ignoring 갑옷, natural
갑옷, and 방패 and using the creature’s ranged 공격 보너스. Ray 공격
have no 거리 increment. The creature’s 설명 문구 specifies the maximum
거리, effects, and any applicable 내성 굴림.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">재생
(Ex): </span><span>A
creature with this ability is difficult to kill. 피해 dealt to the creature
is treated as 비치명적인 피해. The creature automatically 치료 비치명적인 피해 at a fixed rate per round, as given in the entry. Certain 공격 forms,
typically fire and acid, deal lethal 피해 to the creature, which doesn’t go
away. The creature’s 설명 문구 describes the details. A regenerating creature
that has been rendered unconscious through 비치명적인 피해 can be killed with
a coup de grace. The 공격 cannot be of a type that automatically converts to
비치명적인 피해.</span></p><p>공격
forms that don’t deal hit point 피해 ignore 재생. 재생 also
does not restore 히트 포인트 lost from starvation, thirst, or 질식.
Regenerating creatures can regrow lost portions of their bodies and can
reattach severed limbs or body parts; details are in the creature’s 설명 문구. Severed parts that are not reattached wither and die normally.</p><p>A
creature must have a 건강 score to have the 재생 ability.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Reptilian
Subtype: </span><span>These
creatures are scaly and usually coldblooded. The reptilian subtype is only used
to describe a set of humanoid 종족, not all animals and 몬스터 that are
truly reptiles.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">에너지 저항 (Ex):</span><span>
A creature with this special quality ignores some 피해 of the indicated type
each time it takes 피해 of that kind (commonly acid, cold, fire, or
electricity). The entry indicates the amount and type of 피해 ignored.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">냄새
(Ex):</span><span>
This special quality allows a creature to detect approaching enemies, sniff out
hidden foes, and 추적 by sense of smell. Creatures with the 냄새 ability can
식별 familiar odors just as 인간 do familiar sights.</span></p><p>The
creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent
is upwind, the 거리 increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet.
Strong 냄새, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the
거리 noted above. Overpowering 냄새, such as skunk musk or 트로글로다이트
stench, can be detected at triple normal 거리.</p><p>When
a creature detects a 냄새, the exact location of the source is not
revealed—only its presence somewhere within 거리. The creature can take a 이동
action to note the direction of the 냄새.</p><p>Whenever
the creature comes within 5 feet of the source, the creature pinpoints the
source’s location.</p><p>A
creature with the 추적 feat and the 냄새 ability can follow 추적 by smell,
making a 지혜 (or 생존) check to find or follow a 추적. The typical DC
for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the 냄새). This
DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s odor is, the
number of creatures, and the 나이 of the trail. For each hour that the trail is
cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the
추적 feat. Creatures tracking by 냄새 ignore the effects of surface
상태이상 and poor visibility. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Shapechanger
Subtype:</span><span>
A shapechanger has the supernatural ability to assume one or more alternate
forms. Many magical effects allow some kind of shape shifting, and not every
creature that can change shapes has the shapechanger subtype. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>A
shapechanger possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a
creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—Proficient
with its natural 무기, with simple 무기, and with any 무기 mentioned
in the creature’s 묘사.</p><p>—Proficient
with any 갑옷 mentioned in the creature’s 묘사, as well as all lighter
forms. If no form of 갑옷 is mentioned, the shapechanger is not proficient
with 갑옷. A shapechanger is proficient with 방패 if it is proficient with
any type of 갑옷.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Sonic
공격 (Su):</span><span>
Unless otherwise noted, a sonic 공격 follows the rules for spreads. The 거리
of the spread is measured from the creature using the sonic 공격. Once a
sonic 공격 has taken effect, deafening the subject or stopping its ears does
not end the effect. Stopping one’s ears ahead of time allows opponents to avoid
having to make 내성 굴림 against mind-affecting sonic 공격, but not
other kinds of sonic 공격 (such as those that deal 피해). Stopping one’s
ears is a full-round action and requires wax or other soundproof material to
stuff into the ears.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">특수 능력:</span><span>
A special ability is either extraordinary (Ex), spell-like (Sp), or
supernatural (Su).</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Extraordinary:
</span><span>Extraordinary
능력 are nonmagical, don’t become ineffective in an <span style="font-style: italic;">대마법 보호장, </span>and
are not subject to any effect that disrupts magic. Using an extraordinary
ability is a free action unless otherwise noted.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Spell-Like:
</span><span>Spell-like
능력 are magical and work just like 주문 (though they are not 주문 and
so have no verbal, somatic, material, focus, or XP 구성요소). They go away in
an <span style="font-style: italic;">대마법 보호장 </span>and are subject to 주문 저항 if the spell the
ability resembles or duplicates would be subject to 주문 저항.</span></p><p>A
spell-like ability usually has a limit on how often it can be used. A
spell-like ability that can be used at will has no use limit. Using a
spell-like ability is a standard action unless noted otherwise, and doing so
while threatened provokes 기회 공격. It is possible to make a
집중 check to use a spell-like ability defensively and avoid provoking
an 공격 of opportunity, just as when casting a spell. A spell-like ability
can be disrupted just as a spell can be. Spell-like 능력 cannot be used to
counterspell, nor can they be counterspelled.</p><p>For
creatures with spell-like 능력, a designated 시전자 레벨 defines how
difficult it is to dispel their spell-like effects and to define any
레벨-dependent variables (such as 거리 and 지속시간) 능력 might
have. The creature’s 시전자 레벨 never affects which spell-like 능력 the
creature has; sometimes the given 시전자 레벨 is lower than the 레벨 a
spellcasting character would need to cast the spell of the same 이름. If no
시전자 레벨 is specified, the 시전자 레벨 is equal to the creature’s 히트 다이스.
The 내성 굴림 (if any) against a spell-like ability is 10 + the 레벨 of the
spell the ability resembles or duplicates + the creature’s Cha modifier.</p><p>Some
spell-like 능력 duplicate 주문 that work differently when cast by
characters of different classes<span style="font-style: italic;">. </span>A monster’s spell-like 능력 are
presumed to be the 소서러/마법사 versions. If the spell in question is not a
소서러/마법사 spell, then default to 사제, 드루이드, 음유시인, 성기사, and
레인저, in that order.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Supernatural:
</span><span>Supernatural
능력 are magical and go away in an <span style="font-style: italic;">대마법 보호장 </span>but are not
subject to 주문 저항. Supernatural 능력 cannot be dispelled. Using
a supernatural ability is a standard action unless noted otherwise.
Supernatural 능력 may have a use limit or be usable at will, just like
spell-like 능력. However, supernatural 능력 do not provoke 기회 공격 and never require 집중 checks. Unless otherwise noted, a
supernatural ability has an effective 시전자 레벨 equal to the creature’s 히트 다이스. The 내성 굴림 (if any) against a supernatural ability is 10 + 1/2 the
creature’s HD + the creature’s ability modifier (usually 매력).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">주문 면역 (Ex): </span><span>A
creature with 주문 면역 avoids the effects of 주문 and spell-like
능력 that directly affect it. This works exactly like 주문 저항,
except that it cannot be overcome. Sometimes 주문 면역 is conditional or
applies to only 주문 of a certain kind or 레벨. 주문 that do not allow
주문 저항 are not affected by 주문 면역.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">주문 저항 (Ex): </span><span>A creature with 주문 저항 can avoid the effects of
주문 and spell-like 능력 that directly affect it.To determine if a spell
or spell-like ability works against a creature with 주문 저항, the
caster must make a 시전자 레벨 check (1d20 + 시전자 레벨). If the result
equals or exceeds the creature’s 주문 저항, the spell works normally,
although the creature is still allowed a 내성 굴림.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">주문:</span><span> Sometimes a creature can
cast arcane or 신성 주문 just as a member of a spellcasting class can (and
can 마법 아이템 사용 accordingly). Such creatures are subject to the same
spellcasting rules that characters are, except as follows. </span></p><p>A
spellcasting creature that lacks hands or arms can provide any somatic
component a spell might require by moving its body. Such a creature also does
need material 구성요소 for its 주문. The creature can cast the spell by
either touching the required component (but not if the component is in another
creature’s possession) or having the required component on its person.
Sometimes spellcasting creatures utilize the 구성요소 무시 feat to avoid
fussing with noncostly 구성요소.</p><p>A
spellcasting creature is not actually a member of a class unless its entry says
so, and it does not gain any class 능력. A creature with access to 사제 주문 must prepare them in the normal manner and receives domain 주문 if
noted, but it does not receive domain granted powers unless it has at least one
레벨 in the 사제 class.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 700;">Summon
</span><span style="font-weight: 700;">(Sp):</span><span> A creature with the <span style="font-style: italic;">summon
</span>ability can summon specific other creatures of its kind much as though
casting a <span style="font-style: italic;">summon monster </span>spell, but it usually has only a limited chance
of success (as specified in the creature’s entry). Roll d%: On a failure, no
creature answers the summons. Summoned creatures automatically return whence
they came after 1 hour. A creature that has just been summoned cannot use its
own summon ability for 1 hour. Most creatures with the ability to summon do not
use it lightly, since it leaves them beholden to the summoned creature. In
general, they use it only when necessary to save their own lives. An
appropriate spell 레벨 is given for each summoning ability for 목적 of
집중 checks and attempts to dispel the summoned creature. No
experience points are awarded for summoned 몬스터.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Swallow
Whole (Ex):</span><span>
If a creature with this special 공격 begins its turn with an opponent held in
its mouth (see Improved Grab), it can attempt a new 드잡이 check (as though
attempting to pin the opponent). If it succeeds, it swallows its prey, and the
opponent takes bite 피해. Unless otherwise noted, the opponent can be up to
one size category smaller than the swallowing creature. Being swallowed has
various consequences, depending on the creature doing the swallowing. A
swallowed creature is considered to be grappled, while the creature that did
the swallowing is not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with
any 빛 slashing or piercing weapon (the amount of cutting 피해 required to
get free is noted in the creature 묘사), or it can just try to escape
the 드잡이. The 방어도 of the interior of a creature that swallows whole
is normally 10 + 1/2 its natural 갑옷 bonus, with no modifiers for size or
민첩. If the swallowed creature escapes the 드잡이, success puts it back
in the attacker’s mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">무리 떼
Subtype:</span><span>
A 무리 떼 is a collection of Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures that acts as a
single creature. A 무리 떼 has the characteristics of its type, except as noted
here. A 무리 떼 has a single pool of 히트 다이스 and 히트 포인트, a single 선제권
modifier, a single 속도, and a single 방어도. A 무리 떼 makes 내성 굴림
as a single creature. A single 무리 떼 occupies a square (if it is made up of
nonflying creatures) or a cube (of flying creatures) 10 feet on a side, but its
reach is 0 feet, like its component creatures. In order to 공격, it 이동
into an opponent’s space, which provokes an 공격 of opportunity. It can
occupy the same space as a creature of any size, since it crawls all over its
prey. A 무리 떼 can 이동 through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa
without impediment, although the 무리 떼 provokes an 공격 of opportunity if it
does so. A 무리 떼 can 이동 through cracks or holes large enough for its
component creatures.</span></p><p>A
무리 떼 of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures or 1,000 flying
creatures. A 무리 떼 of Diminutive creatures consists of 1,500 nonflying
creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A 무리 떼 of Fine creatures consists of
10,000 creatures, whether they are flying or not. 무리 떼 of nonflying creatures
include many more creatures than could normally fit in a 10-foot square based
on their normal space, because creatures in a 무리 떼 are packed tightly together
and generally crawl over each other and their prey when moving or attacking.
Larger 무리 떼 are represented by multiples of single 무리 떼. The 범위 occupied
by a large 무리 떼 is completely shapeable, though the 무리 떼 usually remains in
contiguous squares.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>A 무리 떼
has no clear front or back and no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to
critical hits or 협공. A 무리 떼 made up of Tiny creatures takes half 피해
from slashing and piercing 무기. A 무리 떼 composed of Fine or Diminutive
creatures is immune to all weapon 피해. Reducing a 무리 떼 to 0 히트 포인트 or
lower causes it to break up, though 피해 taken until that point does not
degrade its ability to 공격 or resist 공격. 무리 떼 are never staggered or
reduced to a 죽어가고 있음 state by 피해. Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or
bull rushed, and they cannot 드잡이 an opponent.</span></p><p>A
무리 떼 is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of
creatures (including single-target 주문 such as <span style="font-style: italic;">분해</span>), with
the exception of mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms,
patterns, and morale effects) if the 무리 떼 has an 지능 score and a hive
mind. A 무리 떼 takes half again as much 피해 (+50%) from 주문 or effects
that affect an 범위, such as splash 무기 and many 환기 주문.</p><p>무리 떼
made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are susceptible to high 바람 such as
that created by a <span style="font-style: italic;">돌풍 </span>spell. For 목적 of determining the
effects of wind on a 무리 떼, treat the 무리 떼 as a creature of the same size as
its constituent creatures. A 무리 떼 rendered unconscious by means of 비치명적인 피해 becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not reform until its 히트 포인트 exceed its 비치명적인 피해.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">무리 떼
공격: </span><span>Creatures
with the 무리 떼 subtype don’t make standard melee 공격. Instead, they deal
automatic 피해 to any creature whose space they occupy at the end of their
이동, with no 명중 굴림 needed. 무리 떼 공격 are not subject to a miss
chance for 은폐 or 엄폐. A 무리 떼’s 수치 표 has “무리 떼” in the
공격 and 전력 공격 entries, with no 공격 보너스 given. The amount of
피해 a 무리 떼 deals is based on its 히트 다이스, as shown below.</span></p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 16.65em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">무리 떼

무리 떼’s 공격 are nonmagical, unless the 무리 떼’s 묘사 states
otherwise. 피해 축소 sufficient to reduce a 무리 떼 공격’s 피해 to 0,
being incorporeal, and other 특수 능력 usually give a creature immunity
(or at least 저항) to 피해 from a 무리 떼. Some 무리 떼 also have acid,

do not threaten creatures in their square, and do not make 기회 공격 with their 무리 떼 공격. However, they 주의산만 foes whose squares

(Ex): </span><span>Any
living creature vulnerable to a 무리 떼’s 피해 that begins its turn with a
무리 떼 in its square is nauseated for 1 round; a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2
무리 떼’s HD + 무리 떼’s Con modifier; the exact DC is given in a 무리 떼’s
묘사) negates the effect. Spellcasting or concentrating on 주문 within
the 범위 of a 무리 떼 requires a 집중 check (DC 20 + spell 레벨). 스킬 사용하기 that involve patience and 집중 requires a DC 20 집중
check.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">정신감응
(Su):</span><span> A
creature with this ability can communicate telepathically with any other
creature within a certain 거리 (specified in the creature’s entry, usually 100
feet) that has a language. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once
telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than
one creature at a time is just as difficult as simultaneously speaking and
listening to multiple people at the same time.</span></p><p>Some
creatures have a limited form of 정신감응, while others have a more powerful
form of the ability.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">짓밟기
(Ex):</span><span> As
a full-round action, a creature with this special 공격 can 이동 up to twice
its 속도 and literally 달리기 over any opponents at least one size category
smaller than itself. The creature merely has to 이동 over the opponents in its
path; any creature whose space is completely covered by the trampling
creature’s space is subject to the 짓밟기 공격. If a target’s space is
larger than 5 feet, it is only considered trampled if the trampling creature
이동 over all the squares it occupies. If the trampling creature 이동 over
only some of a target’s space, the target can make an 공격 of opportunity
against the trampling creature at a –4 penalty. A trampling creature that
accidentally ends its 이동 in an illegal space returns to the last legal
position it occupied, or the closest legal position, if there’s a legal
position that’s closer.</span></p><p>A

creature’s 설명 문구.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">전리품:</span><span> This entry in a monster
묘사 describes how much wealth a creature owns. In most cases, a
creature keeps valuables in its home or lair and has no 전리품 with it when
it travels. Intelligent creatures that own useful, portable 전리품 (such as
마법 아이템) tend to carry and use these, leaving bulky items at home. 전리품
can include 동전, goods, and items. Creatures can have varying amounts of
each, as follows.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Standard:
</span><span>Refer to
the 전리품 tablesand roll d% once for each type of 전리품 (동전,
Goods, Items) on the 레벨 section of the table that 일치 to the
creature’s 도전 지수 (for groups of creatures, use the Encounter 레벨
for the encounter instead). Some creatures have double, triple, or even
quadruple standard 전리품; in these cases, roll for each type of 전리품 two,
three, or four times.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">None:
</span><span>The
creature collects no 전리품 of its own.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Nonstandard:
</span><span>Some
creatures have quirks or habits that affect the types of 전리품 they collect.
These creatures use the same</span></p><p>전리품
tables, but with special adjustments.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Fractional
동전: </span><span>Roll
on the 동전 column in the section corresponding to the creature’s 도전 지수, but divide the result as indicated.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">%
Goods or Items: </span><span>The
creature has goods or items only some of the time. Before checking for goods or
items, roll d% against the given percentage. On a success, make a normal roll
on the appropriate Goods or Items column (which may still result in no goods or
items).</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Double
Goods or Items: </span><span>Roll
twice on the appropriate Goods or Items column.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Parenthetical
Notes: </span><span>Some
entries for goods or items include notes that limit the types of 전리품 a
creature collects.</span></p><p>When
a note includes the word “no,” it means the creature does not collect or cannot
keep that thing. If a random roll generates such a result, treat the result as
“none” instead. </p><p>When
a note includes the word “only,” the creature goes out of its way to collect
전리품 of the indicated type. Treat all results from that column as the
indicated type of 전리품.</p><p>It’s
sometimes necessary to reroll until the right sort of item appears. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">퇴치 저항 (Ex): </span><span>A creature with this special quality (usually an undead) is
less easily affected by 사제 or 성기사. When resolving a turn, rebuke,
명령, or bolster attempt, add the indicated number to the creature’s 히트 다이스 total.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Undead
Type:</span><span>
Undead are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:

points for the first Hit Die, if the undead creature has an 지능 score.
However, many undead are mindless and gain no skill points or 특기.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>An undead
creature possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s
entry).</span></p><p>—No
건강 score.</p><p>—암흑시야

subject to critical hits, 비치명적인 피해, ability drain, or 정령 흡수.
Immune to 피해 to its physical 능력 점수 (근력, 민첩, and
건강), as well as to fatigue and exhaustion effects.</p><p>—Cannot
치료 피해 on its own if it has no 지능 score, although it can be
healed. Negative energy (such as an <span style="font-style: italic;">inflict </span>spell) can 치료 undead
creatures. The 빠른 치료 special quality works regardless of the creature’s
지능 score.</p><p>—Immunity
to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on
objects or is harmless).</p><p>—Uses
its 매력 modifier for 집중 checks.</p><p>—Not
at risk of death from massive 피해, but when reduced to 0 히트 포인트 or less,
it is immediately destroyed.</p><p>—Not
affected by <span style="font-style: italic;">시체 되살리기 </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">환생 </span>주문 or 능력. <span style="font-style: italic;">부활

undead creatures back into the living creatures they were before becoming
undead.</p><p>—Proficient
with its natural 무기, all simple 무기, and any 무기 mentioned in its
entry.</p><p>—Proficient
with whatever type of 갑옷 (빛, medium, or heavy) it is described as
wearing, as well as all lighter types. Undead not indicated as wearing 갑옷
are not proficient with 갑옷. Undead are proficient with 방패 if they are
proficient with any form of 갑옷.</p><p>—Undead
do not breathe, eat, or 수면.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Vermin
Type:</span><span>

공격 보너스 equal to 3/4 total 히트 다이스 (as 사제).</p><p>—Good
Fortitude 내성 굴림.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die, if the vermin has an 지능 score. However,

</span><span>Vermin
possess the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—Mindless:
No 지능 score, and immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms,

with their natural 무기 only.</p><p>—Proficient
with no 갑옷.</p><p>—Vermin breathe,
eat, and 수면.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Vulnerability
to Energy:</span><span>
Some creatures have vulnerability to a certain kind of energy effect (typically
either cold or fire). Such a creature takes half again as much (+50%) 피해 as
normal from the effect, regardless of whether a 내성 굴림 is allowed, or if
the save is a success or failure.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Water
Subtype:</span><span>
This subtype usually is used for 정령 and outsiders with a connection to
the 물 정령 세계. Creatures with the water subtype always have 수영
속도 and can 이동 in water without making 수영 checks. A water creature can
breathe underwater and usually can breathe air as well. </span></p></section></div></main></div><nav class="Layout_sidebar__2Jy-3"><div><div class="SearchForm_searchBox__9EPie
