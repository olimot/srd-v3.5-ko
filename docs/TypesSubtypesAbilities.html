&amp; SPECIAL ABILITIES</h1><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Aberration
Type:</span><span> An
aberration has a bizarre anatomy, strange abilities, an alien mindset, or any
combination of the three.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>An
aberration has the following features.</span></p><p>—d8
Hit Dice.</p><p>—Base
attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p><p>—Good
Will saves.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>An
aberration possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a
creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—Darkvision
out to 60 feet.</p><p>—Proficient
with its natural weapons. If generally humanoid in form, proficient with all
simple weapons and any weapon it is described as using.</p><p>—Proficient
with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as
wearing, as well as all lighter types. Aberrations not indicated as wearing
armor are not proficient with armor. Aberrations are proficient with shields if
they are proficient with any form of armor.</p><p>—Aberrations
eat, sleep, and breathe.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Ability
Score Loss (Su):</span><span>
Some attacks reduce the opponent’s score in one or more abilities. This loss
can be temporary (ability damage) or permanent (ability drain).</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ability
Damage: </span><span>This
attack damages an opponent’s ability score. The creature’s descriptive text
gives the ability and the amount of damage. If an attack that causes ability
damage scores a critical hit, it deals twice the indicated amount of damage (if
the damage is expressed as a die range, roll two dice). Ability damage returns
at the rate of 1 point per day for each affected ability.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ability
Drain: </span><span>This
effect permanently reduces a living opponent’s ability score when the creature
hits with a melee attack. The creature’s descriptive text gives the ability and
the amount drained. If an attack that causes ability drain scores a critical
hit, it drains twice the indicated amount (if the damage is expressed as a die
range, roll two dice). Unless otherwise specified in the creature’s
description, a draining creature gains 5 temporary hit points (10 on a critical
hit) whenever it drains an ability score no matter how many points it drains.
Temporary hit points gained in this fashion last for a maximum of 1 hour.</span></p><p>Some
ability drain attacks allow a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 draining creature’s
racial HD + draining creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the
creature’s descriptive text). If no saving throw is mentioned, none is allowed.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Alternate
Form (Su):</span><span>
A creature with this special quality has the ability to assume one or more
specific alternate forms. This ability works much like the <span style="font-style: italic;">polymorph </span>spell,
except that the creature is limited to the forms specified, and does not regain
any hit points for changing its form. Assuming an alternate form results in the
following changes to the creature:</span></p><p>—The
creature retains the type and subtype of its original form. It gains the size
of its new form.</p><p>—The
creature loses the natural weapons, natural armor, movement modes, and
extraordinary special attacks of its original form.</p><p>—The
creature gains the natural weapons, natural armor, movement modes, and extraordinary
special attacks of its new form.</p><p>—The
creature retains the special qualities of its original form. It does not gain
any special qualities of its new form.</p><p>—The
creature retains the spell-like abilities and supernatural attacks of its old
form (except for breath weapons and gaze attacks). It does not gain the
spell-like abilities or supernatural attacks of its new form.</p><p>—The
creature gains the physical 능력치 점수 (Str, Dex, Con) of its new form. It
retains the mental 능력치 점수 (Int, Wis, Cha) of its original form.</p><p>—The
creature retains its hit points and save bonuses, although its save modifiers
may change due to a change in 능력치 점수.</p><p>—The
creature retains any spellcasting ability it had in its original form, although
it must be able to speak intelligibly to cast spells with verbal components and
it must have humanlike hands to cast spells with somatic components.</p><p>—The
creature is effectively camouflaged as a creature of its new form, and it gains
a +10 bonus on Disguise checks if it uses this ability to create a disguise.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Air
Subtype:</span><span>
This subtype usually is used for elementals and outsiders with a connection to
the Elemental Plane Air. Air creatures always have fly speeds and usually have
perfect maneuverability.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Angel
Subtype:</span><span>
Angels are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to the good-aligned
Outer Planes.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>An angel
possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—Darkvision
out to 60 feet and low-light vision.</p><p>—Immunity
to acid, cold, and petrification.</p><p>—Resistance
to electricity 10 and fire 10.</p><p>—
+4 racial bonus on saves against poison.</p><p>—Protective
Aura (Su): Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span>his
ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on
saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the angel. Otherwise, it functions as
a <span style="font-style: italic;">magic circle against evil </span>effect and a <span style="font-style: italic;">lesser globe of invulnerability,
</span>both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals angel’s HD). (The
defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an angel’s statistics
block.) </p><p>—Tongues
(Su): All angels can speak with any creature that has a language, as though
using a <span style="font-style: italic;">tongues </span>spell (caster level equal to angel’s Hit Dice). This
ability is always active.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Animal
Type:</span><span> An
animal is a living, nonhuman creature, usually a vertebrate with no magical
abilities and no innate capacity for language or culture.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>An animal
has the following features (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—d8
Hit Dice.</p><p>—Base
attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p><p>—Good
Fortitude and Reflex saves (certain animals have different good saves).</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>An animal
possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—Intelligence
score of 1 or 2 (no creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher can be
an animal).</p><p>—Low-light
vision.</p><p>—Alignment:
Always neutral.</p><p>—Treasure:
None.</p><p>—Proficient
with its natural weapons only. A noncombative herbivore uses its natural
weapons as a secondary attack. Such attacks are made with a –5 penalty on the
creature’s attack rolls, and the animal receives only 1/2 its Strength modifier
as a damage adjustment.</p><p>—Proficient
with no armor unless trained for war.</p><p>—Animals
eat, sleep, and breathe.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Aquatic
Subtype:</span><span>
These creatures always have swim speeds and thus can move in water without
making Swim checks. An aquatic creature can breathe underwater. It cannot also
breathe air unless it has the amphibious special quality. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Archon
Subtype:</span><span>
Archons are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to lawful
good-aligned Outer Planes.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>An archon
possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—Darkvision
out to 60 feet and low-light vision.</p><p>—Aura
of Menace (Su): A righteous aura surrounds archons that fight or get angry. Any
hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of an archon must succeed on a Will
save to resist its effects. The save DC varies with the type of archon, is
Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. Those who fail take a –2
penalty on attacks, AC, and saves for 24 hours or until they successfully hit
the archon that generated the aura. A creature that has resisted or broken the
effect cannot be affected again by the same archon’s aura for 24 hours.</p><p>—Immunity
to electricity and petrification.</p><p>—
+4 racial bonus on saves against poison.</p><p>—Magic
Circle against Evil (Su): A magic circle against evil effect always surrounds
an archon (caster level equals the archon’s Hit Dice). (The defensive benefits
from the circle are not included in an archon’s statistics block.)</p><p>—Teleport
(Su): Archons can use greater teleport at will, as the spell (caster level
14th), except that the creature can transport only itself and up to 50 pounds
of objects.</p><p>—Tongues
(Su): All archons can speak with any creature that has a language, as though
using a <span style="font-style: italic;">tongues </span>spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always
active.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Augmented
Subtype:</span><span>
A creature receives this subtype whenever something happens to change its
original type. Some creatures (those with an inherited template) are born with
this subtype; others acquire it when they take on an acquired template. The
augmented subtype is always paired with the creature’s original type. A
creature with the augmented subtype usually has the traits of its current type,
but the features of its original type.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Blindsense
(Ex):</span><span>
Using nonvisual senses, such as acute smell or hearing, a creature with
blindsense notices things it cannot see. The creature usually does not need to
make Spot or Listen checks to pinpoint the location of a creature within range
of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to that
creature. Any opponent the creature cannot see still has total concealment
against the creature with blindsense, and the creature still has the normal
miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects
the movement of a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still
denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot
see.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Blindsight
(Ex):</span><span>
This ability is similar to blindsense, but is far more discerning. Using
nonvisual senses, such as sensitivity to vibrations, keen smell, acute hearing,
or echolocation, a creature with blindsight maneuvers and fights as well as a
sighted creature. Invisibility, darkness, and most kinds of concealment are
irrelevant, though the creature must have line of effect to a creature or
object to discern that creature or object. The ability’s range is specified in
the creature’s descriptive text. The creature usually does not need to make
Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight
ability. Unless noted otherwise, blindsight is continuous, and the creature
need do nothing to use it. Some forms of blindsight, however, must be triggered
as a free action. If so, this is noted in the creature’s description. If a
creature must trigger its blindsight ability, the creature gains the benefits
of blindsight only during its turn.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Breath
Weapon (Su): </span><span>A
breath weapon attack usually deals damage and is often based on some type of
energy.</span></p><p>Such
breath weapons allow a Reflex save for half damage (DC 10 + 1/2 breathing
creature’s racial HD + breathing creature’s Con modifier; the exact DC is given
in the creature’s descriptive text). A creature is immune to its own breath
weapon unless otherwise noted. Some breath weapons allow a Fortitude save or a
Will save instead of a Reflex save.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Change
Shape (Su):</span><span>
A creature with this special quality has the ability to assume the appearance
of a specific creature or type of creature (usually a humanoid), but retains
most of its own physical qualities. A creature cannot change shape to a form
more than one size category smaller or larger than its original form. Changing
shape results in the following changes to the creature:</span></p><p>—The
creature retains the type and subtype of its original form. It gains the size
of its new form.</p><p>—The
creature loses the natural weapons, movement modes, and extraordinary special
attacks of its original form.</p><p>—The
creature gains the natural weapons, movement modes, and extraordinary special
attacks of its new form.</p><p>—The
creature retains all other special attacks and qualities of its original form,
except for breath weapons and gaze attacks.</p><p>—The
creature retains the 능력치 점수 of its original form.</p><p>—The
creature retains its hit points and saves.</p><p>—The
creature retains any spellcasting ability it had in its original form, although
it must be able to speak intelligibly to cast spells with verbal components and
it must have humanlike hands to cast spells with somatic components.</p><p>—The
creature is effectively camouflaged as a creature of its new form, and gains a
+10 bonus on Disguise checks if it uses this ability to create a disguise.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Chaotic
Subtype: </span><span>A
subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the chaotic-aligned Outer
Planes. Most creatures that have this subtype also have chaotic alignments;
however, if their alignments change they still retain the subtype. Any effect
that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the
creature has a chaotic alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The
creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature
with the chaotic subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons
and any weapons it wields were chaotic-aligned (see Damage Reduction, below).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Cold
Subtype: </span><span>A
creature with the cold subtype has immunity to cold. It has vulnerability to
fire, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from
fire, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a
success or failure. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Constrict
(Ex):</span><span> A
creature with this special attack can crush an opponent, dealing bludgeoning
damage, after making a successful grapple check. The amount of damage is given
in the creature’s entry. If the creature also has the improved grab ability it
deals constriction damage in addition to damage dealt by the weapon used to
grab.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Construct
Type: </span><span>A
construct is an animated object or artificially constructed creature.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>A
construct has the following features.</span></p><p>—10-sided
Hit Dice.</p><p>—Base
attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p><p>—No
good saving throws.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die, if the construct has an Intelligence score.
However, most constructs are mindless and gain no skill points or 특기.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>A
construct possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a
creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—No
Constitution score.</p><p>—Low-light
vision.</p><p>—Darkvision
out to 60 feet.</p><p>—Immunity
to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and
morale effects).</p><p>—Immunity
to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease , death effects, and
necromancy effects.</p><p>—Cannot
heal damage on their own, but often can be repaired by exposing them to a
certain kind of effect (see the creature’s description for details) or through
the use of the Craft Construct feat. A construct with the fast healing special
quality still benefits from that quality.</p><p>—Not
subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain,
fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain.</p><p>—Immunity
to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on
objects, or is harmless).</p><p>—Not
at risk of death from massive damage. Immediately destroyed when reduced to 0
hit points or less.</p><p>—Since
it was never alive, a construct cannot be raised or resurrected.</p><p>—Because
its body is a mass of unliving matter, a construct is hard to destroy. It gains
bonus hit points based on size, as shown on the following table.</p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 29.7001em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Construct

do not eat, sleep, or breathe.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Damage
Reduction (Ex or Su):</span><span> A creature with this special quality ignores damage from
most weapons and natural attacks. Wounds heal immediately, or the weapon
bounces off harmlessly (in either case, the opponent knows the attack was
ineffective). The creature takes normal damage from energy attacks (even
nonmagical ones), spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. A
certain kind of weapon can sometimes damage the creature normally, as noted
below.</span></p><p>The
entry indicates the amount of damage ignored (usually 5 to 15 points) and the
type of weapon that negates the ability. </p><p>Some
monsters are vulnerable to piercing, bludgeoning, or slashing damage. </p><p>Some
monsters are vulnerable to certain materials, such as alchemical silver,
adamantine, or cold-forged iron. Attacks from weapons that are not made of the
correct material have their damage reduced, even if the weapon has an
enhancement bonus.</p><p>Some
monsters are vulnerable to magic weapons. Any weapon with at least a +1 magical
enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls overcomes the damage reduction of
these monsters. Such creatures’ natural weapons (but not their attacks with
weapons) are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.</p><p>A
few very powerful monsters are vulnerable only to epic weapons; that is, magic
weapons with at least a +6 enhancement bonus. Such creatures’ natural weapons
are also treated as epic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.</p><p>Some
monsters are vulnerable to chaotic-, evil-, good-, or lawful-aligned weapons.
When a cleric casts <span style="font-style: italic;">align weapon, </span>affected weapons might gain one or
more of these properties, and certain magic weapons have these properties as
well. A creature with an alignment subtype (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) can
overcome this type of damage reduction with its natural weapons and weapons it
wields as if the weapons or natural weapons had an alignment (or alignments)
that match the subtype(s) of the creature. </p><p>When
a damage reduction entry has a dash (–) after the slash, no weapon negates the
damage reduction.</p><p>A
few creatures are harmed by more than one kind of weapon. A weapon of either
type overcomes this damage reduction.</p><p>A
few other creatures require combinations of different types of attacks to
overcome their damage reduction. A weapon must be both types to overcome this
damage reduction. A weapon that is only one type is still subject to damage
reduction.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Dragon
Type:</span><span> A
dragon is a reptilelike creature, usually winged, with magical or unusual
abilities.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>A dragon
has the following features.</span></p><p>—12-sided
Hit Dice.</p><p>—Base
attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as fighter).</p><p>—Good

</span><span>A dragon
possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in the description of a
particular kind).</span></p><p>—Darkvision
out to 60 feet and low-light vision.</p><p>—Immunity
to magic sleep effects and paralysis effects.</p><p>—Proficient

weapons mentioned in its entry.</p><p>—Proficient
with no armor.</p><p>—Dragons
eat, sleep, and breathe.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Earth
Subtype:</span><span>
This subtype usually is used for elementals and outsiders with a connection to
the Elemental Plane of Earth. Earth creatures usually have burrow speeds, and
most earth creatures can burrow through solid rock.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Elemental
Type:</span><span> An
elemental is a being composed of one of the four classical elements: air,
earth, fire, or water.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>An
elemental has the following features.</span></p><p>—8-sided
Hit Dice.</p><p>—Base
attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p><p>—Good
saves depend on the element: Fortitude (earth, water) or Reflex (air, fire).</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>An
elemental possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a
creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—Darkvision
out to 60 feet.</p><p>—Immunity
to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, and stunning.</p><p>—Not
subject to critical hits or flanking.</p><p>—Unlike
most other living creatures, an elemental does not have a dual nature—its soul
and body form one unit. When an elemental is slain, no soul is set loose.
Spells that restore souls to their bodies, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">raise dead, reincarnate, </span>and
<span style="font-style: italic;">resurrection, </span>don’t work on an elemental. It takes a different magical
effect, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">limited wish, wish, miracle, </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">true resurrection, </span>to
restore it to life.</p><p>—Proficient
with natural weapons only, unless generally humanoid in form, in which case
proficient with all simple weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry.</p><p>—Proficient
with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) that it is described as
wearing, as well as all lighter types. Elementals not indicated as wearing
armor are not proficient with armor. Elementals are proficient with shields if
they are proficient with any form of armor.</p><p>—Elementals
do not eat, sleep, or breathe.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Energy
Drain (Su):</span><span>
This attack saps a living opponent’s vital energy and happens automatically
when a melee or ranged attack hits. Each successful energy drain bestows one or
more negative levels (the creature’s description specifies how many). If an
attack that includes an energy drain scores a critical hit, it drains twice the
given amount. Unless otherwise specified in the creature’s description, a
draining creature gains 5 temporary hit points (10 on a critical hit) for each
negative level it bestows on an opponent. These temporary hit points last for a
maximum of 1 hour. An affected opponent takes a –1 penalty on all 스킬 판정
and ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and loses one effective
level or Hit Die (whenever level is used in a die roll or calculation) for each
negative level. A spellcaster loses one spell slot of the highest level of
spells she can cast and (if applicable) one prepared spell of that level; this
loss persists until the negative level is removed. Negative levels remain until
24 hours have passed or until they are removed with a spell, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">restoration</span>.
If a negative level is not removed before 24 hours have passed, the affected
creature must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 draining creature’s racial
HD + draining creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s
descriptive text). On a success, the negative level goes away with no harm to
the creature. On a failure, the negative level goes away, but the creature’s
level is also reduced by one. A separate saving throw is required for each
negative level.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Evil
Subtype: </span><span>A
subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the evil-aligned Outer
Planes. Evil outsiders are also called fiends. Most creatures that have this
subtype also have evil alignments; however, if their alignments change, they
still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a
creature with this subtype as if the creature has an evil alignment, no matter
what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to
its actual alignment. A creature with the evil subtype overcomes damage
reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were evil-aligned
(see Damage Reduction, above).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Extraplanar
Subtype:</span><span>
A subtype applied to any creature when it is on a plane other than its native plane.
A creature that travels the planes can gain or lose this subtype as it goes
from plane to plane. Monster entries assume that encounters with creatures take
place on the Material Plane, and every creature whose native plane is not the
Material Plane has the extraplanar subtype (but would not have when on its home
plane). Every extraplanar creature in this book has a home plane mentioned in
its description. Creatures not labeled as extraplanar are natives of the
Material Plane, and they gain the extraplanar subtype if they leave the
Material Plane. No creature has the extraplanar subtype when it is on a
transitive plane, such as the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, and the Plane
of Shadow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Fast
Healing (Ex):</span><span>
A creature with the fast healing special quality regains hit points at an
exceptionally fast rate, usually 1 or more hit points per round, as given in
the creature’s entry. Except where noted here, fast healing is just like
natural healing. Fast healing does not restore hit points lost from starvation,
thirst, or suffocation, and it does not allow a creature to regrow lost body
parts. Unless otherwise stated, it does not allow lost body parts to be
reattached.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Fear
(Su or Sp):</span><span>
Fear attacks can have various effects.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Fear
Aura (Su): </span><span>The
use of this ability is a free action. The aura can freeze an opponent (such as
a mummy’s despair) or function like the <span style="font-style: italic;">fear </span>spell. Other effects are
possible. A fear aura is an area effect. The descriptive text gives the size
and kind of area.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Fear
Cones (Sp) and Rays (Su): </span><span>These effects usually work like the <span style="font-style: italic;">fear </span>spell. </span></p><p>If
a fear effect allows a saving throw, it is a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 fearsome
creature’s racial HD + creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the
creature’s descriptive text). All fear attacks are mind-affecting fear effects.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Fey
Type:</span><span> A
fey is a creature with supernatural abilities and connections to nature or to
some other force or place. Fey are usually human-shaped.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>A fey has
the following features.</span></p><p>—6-sided
Hit Dice.</p><p>—Base
attack bonus equal to 1/2 total Hit Dice (as wizard).</p><p>—Good
Reflex and Will saves.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (6 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>A fey
possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—Low-light
vision.</p><p>—Proficient
with all simple weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry.</p><p>—Proficient
with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) that it is described as
wearing, as well as all lighter types. Fey not indicated as wearing armor are
not proficient with armor. Fey are proficient with shields if they are
proficient with any form of armor.</p><p>—Fey
eat, sleep, and breathe.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Fire
Subtype:</span><span>
A creature with the fire subtype has immunity to fire. It has vulnerability to
cold, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from
cold, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a
success or failure.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Flight
(Ex or Su):</span><span>
A creature with this ability can cease or resume flight as a free action. If
the ability is supernatural, it becomes ineffective in an antimagic field, and
the creature loses its ability to fly for as long as the antimagic effect
persists.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Frightful
Presence (Ex):</span><span>
This special quality makes a creature’s very presence unsettling to foes. It
takes effect automatically when the creature performs some sort of dramatic
action (such as charging, attacking, or snarling). Opponents within range who
witness the action may become frightened or shaken. Actions required to trigger
the ability are given in the creature’s descriptive text. The range is usually
30 feet, and the duration is usually 5d6 rounds. This ability affects only
opponents with fewer Hit Dice or levels than the creature has. An affected
opponent can resist the effects with a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2
frightful creature’s racial HD + frightful creature’s Cha modifier; the exact
DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). An opponent that succeeds on
the saving throw is immune to that same creature’s frightful presence for 24
hours. Frightful presence is a mind-affecting fear effect. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Gaze
(Su):</span><span> A
gaze special attack takes effect when opponents look at the creature’s eyes.
The attack can have almost any sort of effect: petrification, death, charm, and
so on. The typical range is 30 feet, but check the creature’s entry for
details. The type of saving throw for a gaze attack varies, but it is usually a
Will or Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 gazing creature’s racial HD + gazing
creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive
text). A successful saving throw negates the effect. A monster’s gaze attack is
described in abbreviated form in its description. Each opponent within range of
a gaze attack must attempt a saving throw each round at the beginning of his or
her turn in the initiative order. Only looking directly at a creature with a
gaze attack leaves an opponent vulnerable. Opponents can avoid the need to make
the saving throw by not looking at the creature, in one of two ways. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Averting
Eyes: </span><span>The
opponent avoids looking at the creature’s face, instead looking at its body,
watching its shadow, tracking it in a reflective surface, and so on. Each
round, the opponent has a 50% chance to not need to make a saving throw against
the gaze attack. The creature with the gaze attack, however, gains concealment
against that opponent.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Wearing
a Blindfold: </span><span>The
opponent cannot see the creature at all (also possible to achieve by turning
one’s back on the creature or shutting one’s eyes). The creature with the gaze
attack gains total concealment against the opponent. </span></p><p>A
creature with a gaze attack can actively gaze as an attack action by choosing a
target within range. That opponent must attempt a saving throw but can try to
avoid this as described above. Thus, it is possible for an opponent to save
against a creature’s gaze twice during the same round, once before the
opponent’s action and once during the creature’s turn. </p><p>Gaze
attacks can affect ethereal opponents. A creature is immune to gaze attacks of
others of its kind unless otherwise noted.</p><p>Allies
of a creature with a gaze attack might be affected. All the creature’s allies
are considered to be averting their eyes from the creature with the gaze
attack, and have a 50% chance to not need to make a saving throw against the
gaze attack each round. The creature also can veil its eyes, thus negating its
gaze ability.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Giant
Type:</span><span> A
giant is a humanoid-shaped creature of great strength, usually of at least
Large size.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>A giant
has the following features.</span></p><p>—8-sided
Hit Dice.</p><p>—Base
attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p><p>—Good
Fortitude saves.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>A giant
possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—Low-light
vision.</p><p>—Proficient
with all simple and martial weapons, as well as any natural weapons.</p><p>—Proficient
with whatever type of armor (light, medium or heavy) it is described as
wearing, as well as all lighter types. Giants not described as wearing armor
are not proficient with armor. Giants are proficient with shields if they are
proficient with any form of armor.</p><p>—Giants
eat, sleep, and breathe.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Goblinoid
Subtype:</span><span>
Goblinoids are 은신 humanoids who live by hunting and raiding and who all
speak Goblin.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Good
Subtype:</span><span>
A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the good-aligned Outer
Planes. Most creatures that have this subtype also have good alignments;
however, if their alignments change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect
that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the
creature has a good alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The
creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature
with the good subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and
any weapons it wields were good-aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Humanoid
Type: </span><span>A
humanoid usually has two arms, two legs, and one head, or a humanlike torso,
arms, and a head. Humanoids have few or no supernatural or extraordinary
abilities, but most can speak and usually have well-developed societies. They
usually are Small or Medium. Every humanoid creature also has a subtype.</span></p><p>Humanoids
with 1 Hit Die exchange the features of their humanoid Hit Die for the class
features of a PC or NPC class. Humanoids of this sort are presented as
1st-level warriors, which means that they have average combat ability and poor
saving throws.</p><p>Humanoids
with more than 1 Hit Die are the only humanoids who make use of the features of
the humanoid type.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>A
humanoid has the following features (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s
entry).</span></p><p>—8-sided
Hit Dice, or by character class.</p><p>—Base
attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p><p>—Good
Reflex saves (usually; a humanoid’s good save varies).</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die, or by character class.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>A
humanoid possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s
entry).</span></p><p>—Proficient
with all simple weapons, or by character class.</p><p>—Proficient
with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as
wearing, or by character class. If a humanoid does not have a class and wears
armor, it is proficient with that type of armor and all lighter types.
Humanoids not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor.
Humanoids are proficient with shields if they are proficient with any form of
armor.</p><p>—Humanoids
breathe, eat, and sleep.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Improved
Grab (Ex):</span><span>
If a creature with this special attack hits with a melee weapon (usually a claw
or bite attack), it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a
free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. No initial touch attack
is required. Unless otherwise noted, improved grab works only against opponents
at least one size category smaller than the creature. The creature has the
option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use the part of its body it
used in the improved grab to hold the opponent. If it chooses to do the latter,
it takes a –20 penalty on grapple checks, but is not considered grappled
itself; the creature does not lose its Dexterity bonus to AC, still threatens
an area, and can use its remaining attacks against other opponents. A
successful hold does not deal any extra damage unless the creature also has the
constrict special attack. If the creature does not constrict, each successful
grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the damage
indicated for the attack that established the hold. Otherwise, it deals
constriction damage as well (the amount is given in the creature’s descriptive
text). When a creature gets a hold after an improved grab attack, it pulls the
opponent into its space. This act does not provoke attacks of opportunity. It can
even move (possibly carrying away the opponent), provided it can drag the
opponent’s weight. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Incorporeal
Subtype:</span><span>
An incorporeal creature has no physical body. It can be harmed only by other
incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons,
and spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. It is immune to
all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, it has a
50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy,
negative energy, force effects such as <span style="font-style: italic;">magic missile, </span>or attacks made
with <span style="font-style: italic;">ghost touch </span>weapons). Although it is not a magical attack, holy
water can affect incorporeal undead, but a hit with holy water has a 50% chance
of not affecting an incorporeal creature.</span></p><p>An
incorporeal creature has no natural armor bonus but has a deflection bonus
equal to its Charisma bonus (always at least +1, even if the creature’s
Charisma score does not normally provide a bonus). </p><p>An
incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid objects, but must remain
adjacent to the object’s exterior, and so cannot pass entirely through an
object whose space is larger than its own. It can sense the presence of
creatures or objects within a square adjacent to its current location, but
enemies have total concealment (50% miss chance) from an incorporeal creature
that is inside an object. In order to see farther from the object it is in and
attack normally, the incorporeal creature must emerge. An incorporeal creature
inside an object has total cover, but when it attacks a creature outside the
object it only has cover, so a creature outside with a readied action could
strike at it as it attacks. An incorporeal creature cannot pass through a force
effect.</p><p>An
incorporeal creature’s attacks pass through (ignore) natural armor, armor, and
shields, although deflection bonuses and force effects (such as <span style="font-style: italic;">mage armor</span>)
work normally against it. Incorporeal creatures pass through and operate in
water as easily as they do in air. Incorporeal creatures cannot fall or take
falling damage. Incorporeal creatures cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor
can they be tripped or grappled. In fact, they cannot take any physical action
that would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor are they subject
to such actions. Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not set off traps
that are triggered by weight.</p><p>An
incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if
it doesn’t wish to be. It has no Strength score, so its Dexterity modifier
applies to both its melee attacks and its ranged attacks. Nonvisual senses,
such as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly effective
with regard to incorporeal creatures. Incorporeal creatures have an innate
sense of direction and can move at full speed even when they cannot see.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Lawful:
</span><span>A subtype
usually applied only to outsiders native to the lawful-aligned Outer Planes.
Most creatures that have this subtype also have lawful alignments; however, if
their alignments change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends
on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has a
lawful alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also
suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature with the lawful
subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it
wields were lawful-aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Low-Light
Vision (Ex):</span><span>
A creature with low-light vision can see twice as far as a human in starlight,
moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of shadowy illumination. It
retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Magical
Beast Type:</span><span>
Magical beasts are similar to animals but can have Intelligence scores higher
than 2. Magical beasts usually have supernatural or extraordinary abilities,
but sometimes are merely bizarre in appearance or habits.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>A magical
beast has the following features.</span></p><p>—10-sided
Hit Dice.</p><p>—Base
attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as fighter).</p><p>—Good
Fortitude and Reflex saves.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>A magical
beast possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s
entry).</span></p><p>—Darkvision
out to 60 feet and low-light vision.</p><p>—Proficient
with its natural weapons only.</p><p>—Proficient
with no armor.</p><p>—Magical
beasts eat, sleep, and breathe.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Manufactured
Weapons:</span><span> Some monsters
employ manufactured weapons when they attack. Creatures that use swords, bows,
spears, and the like follow the same rules as characters, including those for
additional attacks from a high base attack bonus and 쌍수 무기 전투술
penalties. This category also includes “found items,” such as rocks and logs,
that a creature wields in combat— in essence, any weapon that is not intrinsic
to the creature.</span></p><p>Some creatures
combine attacks with natural and manufactured weapons when they make a full
attack. When they do so, the manufactured weapon attack is considered the
primary attack unless the creature’s description indicates otherwise and any
natural weapons the creature also uses are considered secondary natural
attacks. These secondary attacks do not interfere with the primary attack as
attacking with an off-hand weapon does, but they take the usual –5 penalty (or
–2 with the Multiattack feat) for such attacks, even if the natural weapon used
is normally the creature’s primary natural weapon.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Monstrous
Humanoid Type: </span><span>Monstrous
humanoids are similar to humanoids, but with monstrous or animalistic features.
They often have magical abilities as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>A
monstrous humanoid has the following features.</span></p><p>—8-sided
Hit Dice.</p><p>—Base
attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as fighter).</p><p>—Good
Reflex and Will saves.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>A
monstrous humanoid possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a
creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—Darkvision
out to 60 feet.</p><p>—Proficient
with all simple weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry.</p><p>—Proficient
with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as
wearing, as well as all lighter types. Monstrous humanoids not indicated as
wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Monstrous humanoids are proficient
with shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.</p><p>—Monstrous
humanoids eat, sleep, and breathe.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Movement
Modes: </span><span>Creatures
may have modes of movement other than walking and running. These are natural,
not magical, unless specifically noted in a monster description.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Burrow:
</span><span>A
creature with a burrow speed can tunnel through dirt, but not through rock
unless the descriptive text says otherwise. Creatures cannot charge or run
while burrowing. Most burrowing creatures do not leave behind tunnels other
creatures can use (either because the material they tunnel through fills in
behind them or because they do not actually dislocate any material when
burrowing); see the individual creature descriptions for details.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Climb:
</span><span>A
creature with a climb speed has a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. The
creature must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC of more
than 0, but it always can choose to take 10 even if rushed or threatened while
climbing. The creature climbs at the given speed while climbing. If it chooses
an accelerated climb it moves at double the given climb speed (or its base land
speed, whichever is lower) and makes a single Climb check at a –5 penalty.
Creatures cannot run while climbing. A creature retains its Dexterity bonus to
Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus on
their attacks against a climbing creature.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Fly:
</span><span>A
creature with a fly speed can move through the air at the indicated speed if
carrying no more than a light load. (Note that medium armor does not
necessarily constitute a medium load.) All fly speeds include a parenthetical
note indicating maneuverability, as follows:</span></p><p>—Perfect:
The creature can perform almost any aerial maneuver it wishes. It moves through
the air as well as a human moves over smooth ground.</p><p>—Good:
The creature is very agile in the air (like a housefly or a hummingbird), but
cannot change direction as readily as those with perfect maneuverability.</p><p>—Average:
The creature can fly as adroitly as a small bird. </p><p>—Poor:
The creature flies as well as a very large bird.</p><p>—Clumsy:
The creature can barely maneuver at all.</p><p>A
creature that flies can make dive attacks. A dive attack works just like a
charge, but the diving creature must move a minimum of 30 feet and descend at
least 10 feet. It can make only claw or talon attacks, but these deal double
damage. A creature can use the run action while flying, provided it flies in a
straight line. </p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Swim:
</span><span>A
creature with a swim speed can move through water at its swim speed without
making Swim checks. It has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some
special action or avoid a hazard. The creature can always can choose to take 10
on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. The creature can use the run
action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Native
Subtype:</span><span>
A subtype applied only to outsiders. These creatures have mortal ancestors or a
strong connection to the Material Plane and can be raised, reincarnated, or
resurrected just as other living creatures can be. Creatures with this subtype
are native to the Material Plane (hence the subtype’s name). Unlike true
outsiders, native outsiders need to eat and sleep. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Natural
Weapons:</span><span>
Natural weapons are weapons that are physically a part of a creature. A
creature making a melee attack with a natural weapon is considered armed and
does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Likewise, it threatens any space it
can reach. Creatures do not receive additional attacks from a high base attack
bonus when using natural weapons. The number of attacks a creature can make
with its natural weapons depends on the type of the attack—generally, a
creature can make one bite attack, one attack per claw or tentacle, one gore
attack, one sting attack, or one slam attack (although Large creatures with
arms or arm-like limbs can make a slam attack with each arm). Refer to the
individual monster descriptions.</span></p><p>Unless
otherwise noted, a natural weapon threatens a critical hit on a natural attack
roll of 20.</p><p>When
a creature has more than one natural weapon, one of them (or sometimes a pair
or set of them) is the primary weapon. All the creature’s remaining natural
weapons are secondary. </p><p>The
primary weapon is given in the creature’s Attack entry, and the primary weapon
or weapons is given first in the creature’s Full Attack entry. A creature’s
primary natural weapon is its most effective natural attack, usually by virtue
of the creature’s physiology, training, or innate talent with the weapon. An
attack with a primary natural weapon uses the creature’s full attack bonus.
Attacks with secondary natural weapons are less effective and are made with a
–5 penalty on the attack roll, no matter how many there are. (Creatures with
the Multiattack feat take only a –2 penalty on secondary attacks.) This penalty
applies even when the creature makes a single attack with the secondary weapon
as part of the attack action or as an attack of opportunity.</p><p>Natural
weapons have types just as other weapons do. The most common are summarized
below.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Bite:
</span><span>The
creature attacks with its mouth, dealing piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning
damage.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Claw
or Talon: </span><span>The
creature rips with a sharp appendage, dealing piercing and slashing damage.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Gore:
</span><span>The
creature spears the opponent with an antler, horn, or similar appendage,
dealing piercing damage.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Slap
or Slam: </span><span>The
creature batters opponents with an appendage, dealing bludgeoning damage.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sting:
</span><span>The
creature stabs with a stinger, dealing piercing damage. Sting attacks usually
deal damage from poison in addition to hit point damage.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Tentacle:
</span><span>The
creature flails at opponents with a powerful tentacle, dealing bludgeoning (and
sometimes slashing) damage. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Nonabilities:</span><span> Some creatures lack
certain 능력치 점수. These creatures do not have an ability score of 0—they
lack the ability altogether. The modifier for a nonability is +0. Other effects
of nonabilities are detailed below.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Strength:
</span><span>Any
creature that can physically manipulate other objects has at least 1 point of
Strength. A creature with no Strength score can’t exert force, usually because
it has no physical body or because it doesn’t move. The creature automatically
fails Strength checks. If the creature can attack, it applies its Dexterity
modifier to its base attack bonus instead of a Strength modifier.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Dexterity:
</span><span>Any
creature that can move has at least 1 point of Dexterity. A creature with no
Dexterity score can’t move. If it can perform actions (such as casting spells),
it applies its Intelligence modifier to initiative checks instead of a
Dexterity modifier. The creature automatically fails Reflex saves and Dexterity
checks.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Constitution:
</span><span>Any
living creature has at least 1 point of Constitution. A creature with no
Constitution has no body or no metabolism. It is immune to any effect that
requires a Fortitude save unless the effect works on objects or is harmless. The
creature is also immune to ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain, and
automatically fails Constitution checks. A creature with no Constitution cannot
tire and thus can run indefinitely without tiring (unless the creature’s
description says it cannot run).</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Intelligence:
</span><span>Any
creature that can think, learn, or remember has at least 1 point of
Intelligence. A creature with no Intelligence score is mindless, an automaton
operating on simple instincts or programmed instructions. It has immunity to mind-affecting
effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) and
automatically fails Intelligence checks.</span></p><p>Mindless
creatures do not gain 특기 or skills, although they may have bonus 특기 or
racial skill bonuses.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Wisdom:
</span><span>Any
creature that can perceive its environment in any fashion has at least 1 point
of Wisdom. Anything with no Wisdom score is an object, not a creature. Anything
without a Wisdom score also has no Charisma score.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Charisma:
</span><span>Any
creature capable of telling the difference between itself and things that are
not itself has at least 1 point of Charisma. Anything with no Charisma score is
an object, not a creature. Anything without a Charisma score also has no Wisdom
score.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Ooze
Type:</span><span> An
ooze is an amorphous or mutable creature, usually mindless.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>An ooze
has the following features.</span></p><p>—10-sided
Hit Dice.</p><p>—Base
attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p><p>—No
good saving throws.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die, if the ooze has an Intelligence score. However,
most oozes are mindless and gain no skill points or 특기.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>An ooze
possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—Mindless:
No Intelligence score, and immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms,
compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).</p><p>—Blind
(but have the blindsight special quality), with immunity to gaze attacks,
visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.</p><p>—Immunity
to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorph, and stunning.</p><p>—Some
oozes have the ability to deal acid damage to objects. In such a case, the
amount of damage is equal to 10 + 1/2 ooze’s HD + ooze’s Con modifier per full
round of contact.</p><p>—Not
subject to critical hits or flanking.</p><p>—Proficient
with its natural weapons only.</p><p>—Proficient
with no armor.</p><p>—Oozes
eat and breathe, but do not sleep.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Outsider
Type: </span><span>An
outsider is at least partially composed of the essence (but not necessarily the
material) of some plane other than the Material Plane. Some creatures start out
as some other type and become outsiders when they attain a higher (or lower)
state of spiritual existence.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>An
outsider has the following features.</span></p><p>—8-sided
Hit Dice.</p><p>—Base
attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as fighter).</p><p>—Good
Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saves.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (8 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>An
outsider possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s
entry).</span></p><p>—Darkvision
out to 60 feet.</p><p>—Unlike
most other living creatures, an outsider does not have a dual nature—its soul
and body form one unit. When an outsider is slain, no soul is set loose. Spells
that restore souls to their bodies, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">raise dead, reincarnate, </span>and
<span style="font-style: italic;">resurrection, </span>don’t work on an outsider. It takes a different magical
effect, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">limited wish, wish, miracle, </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">true resurrection </span>to
restore it to life. An outsider with the native subtype can be raised,
reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living creatures can be.</p><p>—Proficient
with all simple and martial weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry.</p><p>—Proficient
with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as
wearing, as well as all lighter types. Outsiders not indicated as wearing armor
are not proficient with armor. Outsiders are proficient with shields if they
are proficient with any form of armor.</p><p>—Outsiders
breathe, but do not need to eat or sleep (although they can do so if they
wish). Native outsiders breathe, eat, and sleep. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Paralysis
(Ex or Su): </span><span>This
special attack renders the victim immobile. Paralyzed creatures cannot move,
speak, or take any physical actions. The creature is rooted to the spot, frozen
and helpless. Paralysis works on the body, and a character can usually resist
it with a Fortitude saving throw (the DC is given in the creature’s
description). Unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">hold person </span>and similar effects, a paralysis effect
does not allow a new save each round. A winged creature flying in the air at
the time that it is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can’t
swim and may drown. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Plant
Type:</span><span>
This type comprises vegetable creatures. Note that regular plants, such as one
finds growing in gardens and fields, lack Wisdom and Charisma scores (see
Nonabilities, above) and are not creatures, but objects, even though they are
alive. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>A plant
creature has the following features. </span></p><p>—8-sided
Hit Dice.</p><p>—Base
attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p><p>—Good
Fortitude saves.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die, if the plant creature has an Intelligence score.
However, some plant creatures are mindless and gain no skill points or 특기.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>A plant
creature possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s
entry).</span></p><p>—Low-light
vision.</p><p>—Immunity
to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and
morale effects).</p><p>—Immunity
to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorph, and stunning.</p><p>—Not
subject to critical hits.</p><p>—Proficient
with its natural weapons only.</p><p>—Proficient
with no armor.</p><p>—Plants
breathe and eat, but do not sleep.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Poison
(Ex):</span><span>
Poison attacks deal initial damage, such as ability damage (see page 305) or
some other effect, to the opponent on a failed Fortitude save. Unless otherwise
noted, another saving throw is required 1 minute later (regardless of the first
save’s result) to avoid secondary damage. A creature’s descriptive text
provides the details.</span></p><p>A
creature with a poison attack is immune to its own poison and the poison of
others of its kind.</p><p>The
Fortitude save DC against a poison attack is equal to 10 + 1/2 poisoning
creature’s racial HD + poisoning creature’s Con modifier (the exact DC is given
in the creature’s descriptive text).</p><p>A
successful save avoids (negates) the damage.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Pounce
(Ex):</span><span>
When a creature with this special attack makes a charge, it can follow with a
full attack—including rake attacks if the creature also has the rake ability.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Powerful
Charge (Ex):</span><span>
When a creature with this special attack makes a charge, its attack deals extra
damage in addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a charge. The amount
of damage from the attack is given in the creature’s description.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Psionics
(Sp):</span><span>
These are spell-like abilities that a creature generates with the power of its
mind. Psionic abilities are usually usable at will.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Rake
(Ex):</span><span> A
creature with this special attack gains extra natural attacks when it grapples
its foe. Normally, a monster can attack with only one of its natural weapons
while grappling, but a monster with the rake ability usually gains two
additional claw attacks that it can use only against a grappled foe. Rake
attacks are not subject to the usual –4 penalty for attacking with a natural
weapon in a grapple.</span></p><p>A
monster with the rake ability must begin its turn grappling to use its rake—it
can’t begin a grapple and rake in the same turn.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Ray
(Su or Sp):</span><span>
This form of special attack works like a ranged attack. Hitting with a ray
attack requires a successful ranged touch attack roll, ignoring armor, natural
armor, and shield and using the creature’s ranged attack bonus. Ray attacks
have no range increment. The creature’s descriptive text specifies the maximum
range, effects, and any applicable saving throw.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Regeneration
(Ex): </span><span>A
creature with this ability is difficult to kill. Damage dealt to the creature
is treated as nonlethal damage. The creature automatically heals nonlethal
damage at a fixed rate per round, as given in the entry. Certain attack forms,
typically fire and acid, deal lethal damage to the creature, which doesn’t go
away. The creature’s descriptive text describes the details. A regenerating creature
that has been rendered unconscious through nonlethal damage can be killed with
a coup de grace. The attack cannot be of a type that automatically converts to
nonlethal damage.</span></p><p>Attack
forms that don’t deal hit point damage ignore regeneration. Regeneration also
does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation.
Regenerating creatures can regrow lost portions of their bodies and can
reattach severed limbs or body parts; details are in the creature’s descriptive
text. Severed parts that are not reattached wither and die normally.</p><p>A
creature must have a Constitution score to have the regeneration ability.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Reptilian
Subtype: </span><span>These
creatures are scaly and usually coldblooded. The reptilian subtype is only used
to describe a set of humanoid races, not all animals and monsters that are
truly reptiles.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Resistance
to Energy (Ex):</span><span>
A creature with this special quality ignores some damage of the indicated type
each time it takes damage of that kind (commonly acid, cold, fire, or
electricity). The entry indicates the amount and type of damage ignored.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Scent
(Ex):</span><span>
This special quality allows a creature to detect approaching enemies, sniff out
hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. Creatures with the scent ability can
identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights.</span></p><p>The
creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent
is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet.
Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the
ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte
stench, can be detected at triple normal range.</p><p>When
a creature detects a scent, the exact location of the source is not
revealed—only its presence somewhere within range. The creature can take a move
action to note the direction of the scent.</p><p>Whenever
the creature comes within 5 feet of the source, the creature pinpoints the
source’s location.</p><p>A
creature with the Track feat and the scent ability can follow tracks by smell,
making a Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or follow a track. The typical DC
for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This
DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s odor is, the
number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is
cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the
Track feat. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface
conditions and poor visibility. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Shapechanger
Subtype:</span><span>
A shapechanger has the supernatural ability to assume one or more alternate
forms. Many magical effects allow some kind of shape shifting, and not every
creature that can change shapes has the shapechanger subtype. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>A
shapechanger possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a
creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—Proficient
with its natural weapons, with simple weapons, and with any weapons mentioned
in the creature’s description.</p><p>—Proficient
with any armor mentioned in the creature’s description, as well as all lighter
forms. If no form of armor is mentioned, the shapechanger is not proficient
with armor. A shapechanger is proficient with shields if it is proficient with
any type of armor.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Sonic
Attacks (Su):</span><span>
Unless otherwise noted, a sonic attack follows the rules for spreads. The range
of the spread is measured from the creature using the sonic attack. Once a
sonic attack has taken effect, deafening the subject or stopping its ears does
not end the effect. Stopping one’s ears ahead of time allows opponents to avoid
having to make saving throws against mind-affecting sonic attacks, but not
other kinds of sonic attacks (such as those that deal damage). Stopping one’s
ears is a full-round action and requires wax or other soundproof material to
stuff into the ears.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Special
Abilities:</span><span>
A special ability is either extraordinary (Ex), spell-like (Sp), or
supernatural (Su).</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Extraordinary:
</span><span>Extraordinary
abilities are nonmagical, don’t become ineffective in an <span style="font-style: italic;">antimagic field, </span>and
are not subject to any effect that disrupts magic. Using an extraordinary
ability is a free action unless otherwise noted.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Spell-Like:
</span><span>Spell-like
abilities are magical and work just like spells (though they are not spells and
so have no verbal, somatic, material, focus, or XP components). They go away in
an <span style="font-style: italic;">antimagic field </span>and are subject to spell resistance if the spell the
ability resembles or duplicates would be subject to spell resistance.</span></p><p>A
spell-like ability usually has a limit on how often it can be used. A
spell-like ability that can be used at will has no use limit. Using a
spell-like ability is a standard action unless noted otherwise, and doing so
while threatened provokes attacks of opportunity. It is possible to make a
Concentration check to use a spell-like ability defensively and avoid provoking
an attack of opportunity, just as when casting a spell. A spell-like ability
can be disrupted just as a spell can be. Spell-like abilities cannot be used to
counterspell, nor can they be counterspelled.</p><p>For
creatures with spell-like abilities, a designated caster level defines how
difficult it is to dispel their spell-like effects and to define any
level-dependent variables (such as range and duration) the abilities might
have. The creature’s caster level never affects which spell-like abilities the
creature has; sometimes the given caster level is lower than the level a
spellcasting character would need to cast the spell of the same name. If no
caster level is specified, the caster level is equal to the creature’s Hit Dice.
The saving throw (if any) against a spell-like ability is 10 + the level of the
spell the ability resembles or duplicates + the creature’s Cha modifier.</p><p>Some
spell-like abilities duplicate spells that work differently when cast by
characters of different classes<span style="font-style: italic;">. </span>A monster’s spell-like abilities are
presumed to be the sorcerer/wizard versions. If the spell in question is not a
sorcerer/wizard spell, then default to cleric, druid, bard, paladin, and
ranger, in that order.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Supernatural:
</span><span>Supernatural
abilities are magical and go away in an <span style="font-style: italic;">antimagic field </span>but are not
subject to spell resistance. Supernatural abilities cannot be dispelled. Using
a supernatural ability is a standard action unless noted otherwise.
Supernatural abilities may have a use limit or be usable at will, just like
spell-like abilities. However, supernatural abilities do not provoke attacks of
opportunity and never require Concentration checks. Unless otherwise noted, a
supernatural ability has an effective caster level equal to the creature’s Hit
Dice. The saving throw (if any) against a supernatural ability is 10 + 1/2 the
creature’s HD + the creature’s 능력 수정치 (usually Charisma).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell
Immunity (Ex): </span><span>A
creature with spell immunity avoids the effects of spells and spell-like
abilities that directly affect it. This works exactly like spell resistance,
except that it cannot be overcome. Sometimes spell immunity is conditional or
applies to only spells of a certain kind or level. Spells that do not allow
spell resistance are not affected by spell immunity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell
Resistance (Ex): </span><span>A creature with spell resistance can avoid the effects of
spells and spell-like abilities that directly affect it.To determine if a spell
or spell-like ability works against a creature with spell resistance, the
caster must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level). If the result
equals or exceeds the creature’s spell resistance, the spell works normally,
although the creature is still allowed a saving throw.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spells:</span><span> Sometimes a creature can
cast arcane or divine spells just as a member of a spellcasting class can (and
can activate magic items accordingly). Such creatures are subject to the same
spellcasting rules that characters are, except as follows. </span></p><p>A
spellcasting creature that lacks hands or arms can provide any somatic
component a spell might require by moving its body. Such a creature also does
need material components for its spells. The creature can cast the spell by
either touching the required component (but not if the component is in another
creature’s possession) or having the required component on its person.
Sometimes spellcasting creatures utilize the 구성요소 무시 feat to avoid
fussing with noncostly components.</p><p>A
spellcasting creature is not actually a member of a class unless its entry says
so, and it does not gain any class abilities. A creature with access to cleric
spells must prepare them in the normal manner and receives domain spells if
noted, but it does not receive domain granted powers unless it has at least one
level in the cleric class.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 700;">Summon
</span><span style="font-weight: 700;">(Sp):</span><span> A creature with the <span style="font-style: italic;">summon
</span>ability can summon specific other creatures of its kind much as though
casting a <span style="font-style: italic;">summon monster </span>spell, but it usually has only a limited chance
of success (as specified in the creature’s entry). Roll d%: On a failure, no
creature answers the summons. Summoned creatures automatically return whence
they came after 1 hour. A creature that has just been summoned cannot use its
own summon ability for 1 hour. Most creatures with the ability to summon do not
use it lightly, since it leaves them beholden to the summoned creature. In
general, they use it only when necessary to save their own lives. An
appropriate spell level is given for each summoning ability for purposes of
Concentration checks and attempts to dispel the summoned creature. No
experience points are awarded for summoned monsters.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Swallow
Whole (Ex):</span><span>
If a creature with this special attack begins its turn with an opponent held in
its mouth (see Improved Grab), it can attempt a new grapple check (as though
attempting to pin the opponent). If it succeeds, it swallows its prey, and the
opponent takes bite damage. Unless otherwise noted, the opponent can be up to
one size category smaller than the swallowing creature. Being swallowed has
various consequences, depending on the creature doing the swallowing. A
swallowed creature is considered to be grappled, while the creature that did
the swallowing is not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with
any light slashing or piercing weapon (the amount of cutting damage required to
get free is noted in the creature description), or it can just try to escape
the grapple. The Armor Class of the interior of a creature that swallows whole
is normally 10 + 1/2 its natural armor bonus, with no modifiers for size or
Dexterity. If the swallowed creature escapes the grapple, success puts it back
in the attacker’s mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Swarm
Subtype:</span><span>
A swarm is a collection of Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures that acts as a
single creature. A swarm has the characteristics of its type, except as noted
here. A swarm has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative
modifier, a single speed, and a single Armor Class. A swarm makes saving throws
as a single creature. A single swarm occupies a square (if it is made up of
nonflying creatures) or a cube (of flying creatures) 10 feet on a side, but its
reach is 0 feet, like its component creatures. In order to attack, it moves
into an opponent’s space, which provokes an attack of opportunity. It can
occupy the same space as a creature of any size, since it crawls all over its
prey. A swarm can move through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa
without impediment, although the swarm provokes an attack of opportunity if it
does so. A swarm can move through cracks or holes large enough for its
component creatures.</span></p><p>A
swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures or 1,000 flying
creatures. A swarm of Diminutive creatures consists of 1,500 nonflying
creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Fine creatures consists of
10,000 creatures, whether they are flying or not. Swarms of nonflying creatures
include many more creatures than could normally fit in a 10-foot square based
on their normal space, because creatures in a swarm are packed tightly together
and generally crawl over each other and their prey when moving or attacking.
Larger swarms are represented by multiples of single swarms. The area occupied
by a large swarm is completely shapeable, though the swarm usually remains in
contiguous squares.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>A swarm
has no clear front or back and no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to
critical hits or flanking. A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes half damage
from slashing and piercing weapons. A swarm composed of Fine or Diminutive
creatures is immune to all weapon damage. Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or
lower causes it to break up, though damage taken until that point does not
degrade its ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never staggered or
reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or
bull rushed, and they cannot grapple an opponent.</span></p><p>A
swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of
creatures (including single-target spells such as <span style="font-style: italic;">disintegrate</span>), with
the exception of mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms,
patterns, and morale effects) if the swarm has an Intelligence score and a hive
mind. A swarm takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects
that affect an area, such as splash weapons and many evocation spells.</p><p>Swarms
made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are susceptible to high winds such as
that created by a <span style="font-style: italic;">gust of wind </span>spell. For purposes of determining the
effects of wind on a swarm, treat the swarm as a creature of the same size as
its constituent creatures. A swarm rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal
damage becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not reform until its hit
points exceed its nonlethal damage.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Swarm
Attack: </span><span>Creatures
with the swarm subtype don’t make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal
automatic damage to any creature whose space they occupy at the end of their
move, with no attack roll needed. Swarm attacks are not subject to a miss
chance for concealment or cover. A swarm’s statistics block has “swarm” in the
Attack and Full Attack entries, with no attack bonus given. The amount of
damage a swarm deals is based on its Hit Dice, as shown below.</span></p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 16.65em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Swarm

swarm’s attacks are nonmagical, unless the swarm’s description states
otherwise. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a swarm attack’s damage to 0,
being incorporeal, and other special abilities usually give a creature immunity
(or at least resistance) to damage from a swarm. Some swarms also have acid,
poison, blood drain, or other special attacks in addition to normal damage.</p><p>Swarms
do not threaten creatures in their square, and do not make attacks of
opportunity with their swarm attack. However, they distract foes whose squares
they occupy, as described below.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Distraction
(Ex): </span><span>Any
living creature vulnerable to a swarm’s damage that begins its turn with a
swarm in its square is nauseated for 1 round; a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2
swarm’s HD + swarm’s Con modifier; the exact DC is given in a swarm’s
description) negates the effect. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within
the area of a swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). Using
skills that involve patience and concentration requires a DC 20 Concentration
check.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Telepathy
(Su):</span><span> A
creature with this ability can communicate telepathically with any other
creature within a certain range (specified in the creature’s entry, usually 100
feet) that has a language. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once
telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than
one creature at a time is just as difficult as simultaneously speaking and
listening to multiple people at the same time.</span></p><p>Some
creatures have a limited form of telepathy, while others have a more powerful
form of the ability.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Trample
(Ex):</span><span> As
a full-round action, a creature with this special attack can move up to twice
its speed and literally run over any opponents at least one size category
smaller than itself. The creature merely has to move over the opponents in its
path; any creature whose space is completely covered by the trampling
creature’s space is subject to the trample attack. If a target’s space is
larger than 5 feet, it is only considered trampled if the trampling creature
moves over all the squares it occupies. If the trampling creature moves over
only some of a target’s space, the target can make an attack of opportunity
against the trampling creature at a –4 penalty. A trampling creature that
accidentally ends its movement in an illegal space returns to the last legal
position it occupied, or the closest legal position, if there’s a legal
position that’s closer.</span></p><p>A
trample attack deals bludgeoning damage (the creature’s slam damage + 1-1/2
times its Str modifier). The creature’s descriptive text gives the exact
amount.</p><p>Trampled
opponents can attempt attacks of opportunity, but these take a –4 penalty. If
they do not make attacks of opportunity, trampled opponents can attempt Reflex
saves to take half damage.</p><p>The
save DC against a creature’s trample attack is 10 + 1/2 creature’s HD +
creature’s Str modifier (the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive
text). A trampling creature can only deal trampling damage to each target once
per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target
creature.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Tremorsense
(Ex): </span><span>A
creature with tremorsense is sensitive to vibrations in the ground and can
automatically pinpoint the location of anything that is in contact with the
ground. Aquatic creatures with tremorsense can also sense the location of
creatures moving through water. The ability’s range is specified in the
creature’s descriptive text.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Treasure:</span><span> This entry in a monster
description describes how much wealth a creature owns. In most cases, a
creature keeps valuables in its home or lair and has no treasure with it when
it travels. Intelligent creatures that own useful, portable treasure (such as
magic items) tend to carry and use these, leaving bulky items at home. Treasure
can include coins, goods, and items. Creatures can have varying amounts of
each, as follows.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Standard:
</span><span>Refer to
the treasure tablesand roll d% once for each type of treasure (Coins,
Goods, Items) on the Level section of the table that corresponds to the
creature’s Challenge Rating (for groups of creatures, use the Encounter Level
for the encounter instead). Some creatures have double, triple, or even
quadruple standard treasure; in these cases, roll for each type of treasure two,
three, or four times.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">None:
</span><span>The
creature collects no treasure of its own.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Nonstandard:
</span><span>Some
creatures have quirks or habits that affect the types of treasure they collect.
These creatures use the same</span></p><p>treasure
tables, but with special adjustments.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Fractional
Coins: </span><span>Roll
on the Coins column in the section corresponding to the creature’s Challenge
Rating, but divide the result as indicated.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">%
Goods or Items: </span><span>The
creature has goods or items only some of the time. Before checking for goods or
items, roll d% against the given percentage. On a success, make a normal roll
on the appropriate Goods or Items column (which may still result in no goods or
items).</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Double
Goods or Items: </span><span>Roll
twice on the appropriate Goods or Items column.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Parenthetical
Notes: </span><span>Some
entries for goods or items include notes that limit the types of treasure a
creature collects.</span></p><p>When
a note includes the word “no,” it means the creature does not collect or cannot
keep that thing. If a random roll generates such a result, treat the result as
“none” instead. </p><p>When
a note includes the word “only,” the creature goes out of its way to collect
treasure of the indicated type. Treat all results from that column as the
indicated type of treasure.</p><p>It’s
sometimes necessary to reroll until the right sort of item appears. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Turn
Resistance (Ex): </span><span>A creature with this special quality (usually an undead) is
less easily affected by clerics or paladins. When resolving a turn, rebuke,
command, or bolster attempt, add the indicated number to the creature’s Hit
Dice total.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Undead
Type:</span><span>
Undead are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>An undead
creature has the following features.</span></p><p>—12-sided
Hit Dice.</p><p>—Base
attack bonus equal to 1/2 total Hit Dice (as wizard).</p><p>—Good
Will saves.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (4 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die, if the undead creature has an Intelligence score.
However, many undead are mindless and gain no skill points or 특기.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>An undead
creature possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s
entry).</span></p><p>—No
Constitution score.</p><p>—Darkvision
out to 60 feet.</p><p>—Immunity
to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and
morale effects).</p><p>—Immunity
to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, and death effects.</p><p>—Not
subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability drain, or energy drain.
Immune to damage to its physical 능력치 점수 (Strength, Dexterity, and
Constitution), as well as to fatigue and exhaustion effects.</p><p>—Cannot
heal damage on its own if it has no Intelligence score, although it can be
healed. Negative energy (such as an <span style="font-style: italic;">inflict </span>spell) can heal undead
creatures. The fast healing special quality works regardless of the creature’s
Intelligence score.</p><p>—Immunity
to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on
objects or is harmless).</p><p>—Uses
its Charisma modifier for Concentration checks.</p><p>—Not
at risk of death from massive damage, but when reduced to 0 hit points or less,
it is immediately destroyed.</p><p>—Not
affected by <span style="font-style: italic;">raise dead </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">reincarnate </span>spells or abilities. <span style="font-style: italic;">Resurrection
</span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">true resurrection </span>can affect undead creatures. These spells turn
undead creatures back into the living creatures they were before becoming
undead.</p><p>—Proficient
with its natural weapons, all simple weapons, and any weapons mentioned in its
entry.</p><p>—Proficient
with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as
wearing, as well as all lighter types. Undead not indicated as wearing armor
are not proficient with armor. Undead are proficient with shields if they are
proficient with any form of armor.</p><p>—Undead
do not breathe, eat, or sleep.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Vermin
Type:</span><span>
This type includes insects, arachnids, other arthropods, worms, and similar
invertebrates.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><span>Vermin
have the following features.</span></p><p>—8-sided
Hit Dice.</p><p>—Base
attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p><p>—Good
Fortitude saves.</p><p>—Skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill
points for the first Hit Die, if the vermin has an Intelligence score. However,
most vermin are mindless and gain no skill points or 특기.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits:
</span><span>Vermin
possess the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span></p><p>—Mindless:
No Intelligence score, and immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms,
compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).</p><p>—Darkvision
out to 60 feet.</p><p>—Proficient
with their natural weapons only.</p><p>—Proficient
with no armor.</p><p>—Vermin breathe,
eat, and sleep.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Vulnerability
to Energy:</span><span>
Some creatures have vulnerability to a certain kind of energy effect (typically
either cold or fire). Such a creature takes half again as much (+50%) damage as
normal from the effect, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if
the save is a success or failure.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Water
Subtype:</span><span>
This subtype usually is used for elementals and outsiders with a connection to
the Elemental Plane of Water. Creatures with the water subtype always have swim
speeds and can move in water without making Swim checks. A water creature can
breathe underwater and usually can breathe air as well. </span></p></section></div></main></div><nav class="Layout_sidebar__2Jy-3"><div><div class="SearchForm_searchBox__9EPie

In order to attack, it moves\ninto an opponent’s space, which provokes an attack of opportunity. It can\noccupy the same space as a creature of any size, since it crawls all over its\nprey.
