      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Aberration Type:</span
        ><span>
          An aberration has a bizarre anatomy, strange abilities, an alien mindset, or any combination of the
          three.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features: </span><span>An aberration has the following features.</span></p>
      <p>—d8 Hit Dice.</p>
      <p>—Base 공격 보너스 equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p>
      <p>—Good Will saves.</p>
      <p>
        —Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
        Die.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Traits: </span
        ><span>An aberration possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span>
      </p>
      <p>—암흑시야 out to 60 feet.</p>
      <p>
        —Proficient with its natural weapons. If generally humanoid in form, proficient with all simple weapons and any
        weapon it is described as using.
      </p>
      <p>
        —Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all
        lighter types. Aberrations not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Aberrations are
        proficient with shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.
      </p>
      <p>—Aberrations eat, sleep, and breathe.</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">능력치 점수 손실 (Su):</span
        ><span>
          Some attacks reduce the opponent’s score in one or more abilities. This loss can be temporary (ability damage)
          or permanent (ability drain).</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Ability Damage: </span
        ><span
          >This attack damages an opponent’s ability score. The creature’s descriptive text gives the ability and the
          amount of damage. If an attack that causes ability damage scores a critical hit, it deals twice the indicated
          amount of damage (if the damage is expressed as a die range, roll two dice). Ability damage returns at the
          rate of 1 point per day for each affected ability.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Ability Drain: </span
        ><span
          >This effect permanently reduces a living opponent’s ability score when the creature hits with a melee attack.
          The creature’s descriptive text gives the ability and the amount drained. If an attack that causes ability
          drain scores a critical hit, it drains twice the indicated amount (if the damage is expressed as a die range,
          roll two dice). Unless otherwise specified in the creature’s description, a draining creature gains 5
          temporary 체력 (10 on a critical hit) whenever it drains an ability score no matter how many points it drains.
          Temporary 체력 gained in this fashion last for a maximum of 1 hour.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Some ability drain attacks allow a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 draining creature’s racial HD + draining
        creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). If no 내성 굴림 is
        mentioned, none is allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Alternate Form (Su):</span
        ><span>
          A creature with this special quality has the ability to assume one or more specific alternate forms. This
          ability works much like the <span style="font-style: italic;">polymorph </span>spell, except that the creature
          is limited to the forms specified, and does not regain any 체력 for changing its form. Assuming an alternate
          form results in the following changes to the creature:</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>—The creature retains the type and subtype of its original form. It gains the size of its new form.</p>
      <p>
        —The creature loses the natural weapons, natural armor, movement modes, and extraordinary special attacks of its
        original form.
      </p>
      <p>
        —The creature gains the natural weapons, natural armor, movement modes, and extraordinary special attacks of its
        new form.
      </p>
      <p>
        —The creature retains the special qualities of its original form. It does not gain any special qualities of its
        new form.
      </p>
      <p>
        —The creature retains the spell-like abilities and supernatural attacks of its old form (except for 브레스 무기
        and 시선 공격). It does not gain the spell-like abilities or supernatural attacks of its new form.
      </p>
      <p>
        —The creature gains the physical 능력치 점수 (Str, Dex, Con) of its new form. It retains the mental 능력치 점수
        (Int, Wis, Cha) of its original form.
      </p>
      <p>
        —The creature retains its 체력 and save bonuses, although its save modifiers may change due to a change in
        능력치 점수.
      </p>
      <p>
        —The creature retains any spellcasting ability it had in its original form, although it must be able to speak
        intelligibly to cast spells with verbal components and it must have humanlike hands to cast spells with somatic
        components.
      </p>
      <p>
        —The creature is effectively camouflaged as a creature of its new form, and it gains a +10 bonus on Disguise
        checks if it uses this ability to create a disguise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Air Subtype:</span
        ><span>
          This subtype usually is used for elementals and outsiders with a connection to the Elemental Plane Air. Air
          creatures always have fly speeds and usually have perfect maneuverability.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Angel Subtype:</span
        ><span> Angels are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to the good-aligned Outer Planes.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Traits: </span
        ><span>An angel possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span>
      </p>
      <p>—암흑시야 out to 60 feet and 저광시야.</p>
      <p>—Immunity to acid, cold, and petrification.</p>
      <p>—Resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10.</p>
      <p>— +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.</p>
      <p>
        —Protective Aura (Su): Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures,
        <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span>his ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance
        bonus on 내성 굴림 to anyone within 20 feet of the angel. Otherwise, it functions as a
        <span style="font-style: italic;">magic circle against evil </span>effect and a
        <span style="font-style: italic;">lesser globe of invulnerability, </span>both with a radius of 20 feet (caster
        level equals angel’s HD). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an angel’s statistics
        block.)
      </p>
      <p>
        —Tongues (Su): All angels can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a
        <span style="font-style: italic;">tongues </span>spell (caster level equal to angel’s Hit Dice). This ability is
        always active.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Animal Type:</span
        ><span>
          An animal is a living, nonhuman creature, usually a vertebrate with no magical abilities and no innate
          capacity for language or culture.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Features: </span
        ><span>An animal has the following features (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span>
      </p>
      <p>—d8 Hit Dice.</p>
      <p>—Base 공격 보너스 equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p>
      <p>—Good Fortitude and Reflex saves (certain animals have different good saves).</p>
      <p>
        —Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
        Die.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Traits: </span
        ><span>An animal possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span>
      </p>
      <p>—Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (no creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher can be an animal).</p>
      <p>—Low-light vision.</p>
      <p>—Alignment: Always neutral.</p>
      <p>—전리품: None.</p>
      <p>
        —Proficient with its natural weapons only. A noncombative herbivore uses its natural weapons as a secondary
        attack. Such attacks are made with a –5 penalty on the creature’s 명중 굴림, and the animal receives only 1/2
        its Strength modifier as a damage adjustment.
      </p>
      <p>—Proficient with no armor unless trained for war.</p>
      <p>—Animals eat, sleep, and breathe.</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Aquatic Subtype:</span
        ><span>
          These creatures always have swim speeds and thus can move in water without making Swim checks. An aquatic
          creature can breathe underwater. It cannot also breathe air unless it has the amphibious special quality.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Archon Subtype:</span
        ><span> Archons are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to lawful good-aligned Outer Planes.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Traits: </span
        ><span>An archon possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span>
      </p>
      <p>—암흑시야 out to 60 feet and 저광시야.</p>
      <p>
        —Aura of Menace (Su): A righteous aura surrounds archons that fight or get angry. Any hostile creature within a
        20-foot radius of an archon must succeed on a Will save to resist its effects. The save DC varies with the type
        of archon, is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. Those who fail take a –2 penalty on attacks, AC,
        and saves for 24 hours or until they successfully hit the archon that generated the aura. A creature that has
        resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by the same archon’s aura for 24 hours.
      </p>
      <p>—Immunity to electricity and petrification.</p>
      <p>— +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.</p>
      <p>
        —Magic Circle against Evil (Su): A magic circle against evil effect always surrounds an archon (caster level
        equals the archon’s Hit Dice). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an archon’s
        statistics block.)
      </p>
      <p>
        —Teleport (Su): Archons can use greater teleport at will, as the spell (caster level 14th), except that the
        creature can transport only itself and up to 50 pounds of objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        —Tongues (Su): All archons can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a
        <span style="font-style: italic;">tongues </span>spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Augmented Subtype:</span
        ><span>
          A creature receives this subtype whenever something happens to change its original type. Some creatures (those
          with an inherited template) are born with this subtype; others acquire it when they take on an acquired
          template. The augmented subtype is always paired with the creature’s original type. A creature with the
          augmented subtype usually has the traits of its current type, but the features of its original type.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Blindsense (Ex):</span
        ><span>
          Using nonvisual senses, such as acute smell or hearing, a creature with blindsense notices things it cannot
          see. The creature usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to pinpoint the location of a creature
          within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to that creature. Any opponent the
          creature cannot see still has total concealment against the creature with blindsense, and the creature still
          has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of
          a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to 방어도 against
          attacks from creatures it cannot see.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Blindsight (Ex):</span
        ><span>
          This ability is similar to blindsense, but is far more discerning. Using nonvisual senses, such as sensitivity
          to vibrations, keen smell, acute hearing, or echolocation, a creature with blindsight maneuvers and fights as
          well as a sighted creature. 투명상태, darkness, and most kinds of concealment are irrelevant, though the
          creature must have line of effect to a creature or object to discern that creature or object. The ability’s
          range is specified in the creature’s descriptive text. The creature usually does not need to make Spot or
          Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight ability. Unless noted otherwise, blindsight
          is continuous, and the creature need do nothing to use it. Some forms of blindsight, however, must be
          triggered as a free action. If so, this is noted in the creature’s description. If a creature must trigger its
          blindsight ability, the creature gains the benefits of blindsight only during its turn.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">브레스 무기 (Su): </span
        ><span>브레스 무기 attack usually deals damage and is often based on some type of energy.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Such 브레스 무기 allow a Reflex save for half damage (DC 10 + 1/2 breathing creature’s racial HD + breathing
        creature’s Con modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). A creature is immune to its
        own 브레스 무기 unless otherwise noted. Some 브레스 무기 allow a Fortitude save or a Will save instead of a
        Reflex save.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Change Shape (Su):</span
        ><span>
          A creature with this special quality has the ability to assume the appearance of a specific creature or type
          of creature (usually a humanoid), but retains most of its own physical qualities. A creature cannot change
          shape to a form more than one size category smaller or larger than its original form. Changing shape results
          in the following changes to the creature:</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>—The creature retains the type and subtype of its original form. It gains the size of its new form.</p>
      <p>
        —The creature loses the natural weapons, movement modes, and extraordinary special attacks of its original form.
      </p>
      <p>—The creature gains the natural weapons, movement modes, and extraordinary special attacks of its new form.</p>
      <p>
        —The creature retains all other special attacks and qualities of its original form, except for 브레스 무기 and
        시선 공격.
      </p>
      <p>—The creature retains the 능력치 점수 of its original form.</p>
      <p>—The creature retains its 체력 and saves.</p>
      <p>
        —The creature retains any spellcasting ability it had in its original form, although it must be able to speak
        intelligibly to cast spells with verbal components and it must have humanlike hands to cast spells with somatic
        components.
      </p>
      <p>
        —The creature is effectively camouflaged as a creature of its new form, and gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks
        if it uses this ability to create a disguise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Chaotic Subtype: </span
        ><span
          >A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the chaotic-aligned Outer Planes. Most creatures that
          have this subtype also have chaotic alignments; however, if their alignments change they still retain the
          subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has a
          chaotic alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to
          its actual alignment. A creature with the chaotic subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons
          and any weapons it wields were chaotic-aligned (see Damage Reduction, below).</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Cold Subtype: </span
        ><span
          >A creature with the cold subtype has immunity to cold. It has vulnerability to fire, which means it takes
          half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a 내성 굴림 is allowed, or if the
          save is a success or failure.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Constrict (Ex):</span
        ><span>
          A creature with this special attack can crush an opponent, dealing bludgeoning damage, after making a
          successful grapple check. The amount of damage is given in the creature’s entry. If the creature also has the
          improved grab ability it deals constriction damage in addition to damage dealt by the weapon used to
          grab.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Construct Type: </span
        ><span>A construct is an animated object or artificially constructed creature.</span>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features: </span><span>A construct has the following features.</span></p>
      <p>—10-sided Hit Dice.</p>
      <p>—Base 공격 보너스 equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p>
      <p>—No good 내성 굴림.</p>
      <p>
        —Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
        Die, if the construct has an Intelligence score. However, most constructs are mindless and gain no skill points
        or 특기.

        ><span>A construct possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span>
      </p>
      <p>—No Constitution score.</p>
      <p>—Low-light vision.</p>
      <p>—암흑시야 out to 60 feet.</p>
      <p>—Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).</p>
      <p>—Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease , death effects, and necromancy effects.</p>
      <p>
        —Cannot heal damage on their own, but often can be repaired by exposing them to a certain kind of effect (see
        the creature’s description for details) or through the use of the Craft Construct feat. A construct with the
        fast healing special quality still benefits from that quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        —Not subject to critical hits, 비치명적인 피해, ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy
        drain.
      </p>
      <p>
        —Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects, or is
        harmless).
      </p>
      <p>—Not at risk of death from massive damage. Immediately destroyed when reduced to 0 체력 or less.</p>
      <p>—Since it was never alive, a construct cannot be raised or resurrected.</p>
      <p>
        —Because its body is a mass of unliving matter, a construct is hard to destroy. It gains bonus 체력 based on
        size, as shown on the following table.

        ><span>
          A creature with this special quality ignores damage from most weapons and natural attacks. Wounds heal
          immediately, or the weapon bounces off harmlessly (in either case, the opponent knows the attack was
          ineffective). The creature takes normal damage from energy attacks (even nonmagical ones), spells, spell-like
          abilities, and supernatural abilities. A certain kind of weapon can sometimes damage the creature normally, as
          noted below.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The entry indicates the amount of damage ignored (usually 5 to 15 points) and the type of weapon that negates
        the ability.
      </p>
      <p>Some monsters are vulnerable to piercing, bludgeoning, or slashing damage.</p>
      <p>
        Some monsters are vulnerable to certain materials, such as alchemical silver, adamantine, or cold-forged iron.
        Attacks from weapons that are not made of the correct material have their damage reduced, even if the weapon has
        an enhancement bonus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some monsters are vulnerable to magic weapons. Any weapon with at least a +1 magical enhancement bonus on attack
        and damage rolls overcomes the damage reduction of these monsters. Such creatures’ natural weapons (but not
        their attacks with weapons) are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few very powerful monsters are vulnerable only to epic weapons; that is, magic weapons with at least a +6
        enhancement bonus. Such creatures’ natural weapons are also treated as epic weapons for the purpose of
        overcoming damage reduction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some monsters are vulnerable to chaotic-, evil-, good-, or lawful-aligned weapons. When a cleric casts
        <span style="font-style: italic;">align weapon, </span>affected weapons might gain one or more of these
        properties, and certain magic weapons have these properties as well. A creature with an alignment subtype
        (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) can overcome this type of damage reduction with its natural weapons and weapons
        it wields as if the weapons or natural weapons had an alignment (or alignments) that match the subtype(s) of the
        creature.
      </p>
      <p>When a damage reduction entry has a dash (–) after the slash, no weapon negates the damage reduction.</p>
      <p>
        A few creatures are harmed by more than one kind of weapon. A weapon of either type overcomes this damage
        reduction.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few other creatures require combinations of different types of attacks to overcome their damage reduction. A
        weapon must be both types to overcome this damage reduction. A weapon that is only one type is still subject to
        damage reduction.

      <p>—Not subject to critical hits or flanking.</p>
      <p>
        —Unlike most other living creatures, an elemental does not have a dual nature—its soul and body form one unit.
        When an elemental is slain, no soul is set loose. Spells that restore souls to their bodies, such as
        <span style="font-style: italic;">raise dead, reincarnate, </span>and
        <span style="font-style: italic;">resurrection, </span>don’t work on an elemental. It takes a different magical
        effect, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">limited wish, wish, miracle, </span>or
        <span style="font-style: italic;">true resurrection, </span>to restore it to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        —Proficient with natural weapons only, unless generally humanoid in form, in which case proficient with all
        simple weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry.
      </p>
      <p>
        —Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) that it is described as wearing, as well as
        all lighter types. Elementals not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Elementals are
        proficient with shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.
      </p>
      <p>—Elementals do not eat, sleep, or breathe.</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Energy Drain (Su):</span
        ><span>
          This attack saps a living opponent’s vital energy and happens automatically when a melee or ranged attack
          hits. Each successful energy drain bestows one or more negative levels (the creature’s description specifies
          how many). If an attack that includes an energy drain scores a critical hit, it drains twice the given amount.
          Unless otherwise specified in the creature’s description, a draining creature gains 5 temporary 체력 (10 on a
          critical hit) for each negative level it bestows on an opponent. These temporary 체력 last for a maximum of 1
          hour. An affected opponent takes a –1 penalty on all 스킬 판정 and ability checks, 명중 굴림, and 내성 굴림,
          and loses one effective level or Hit Die (whenever level is used in a die roll or calculation) for each
          negative level. A spellcaster loses one spell slot of the highest level of spells she can cast and (if
          applicable) one prepared spell of that level; this loss persists until the negative level is removed. Negative
          levels remain until 24 hours have passed or until they are removed with a spell, such as
          <span style="font-style: italic;">restoration</span>. If a negative level is not removed before 24 hours have
          passed, the affected creature must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 draining creature’s racial HD +
          draining creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). On a success, the
          negative level goes away with no harm to the creature. On a failure, the negative level goes away, but the
          creature’s level is also reduced by one. A separate 내성 굴림 is required for each negative level.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Evil Subtype: </span
        ><span
          >A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the evil-aligned Outer Planes. Evil outsiders are also
          called fiends. Most creatures that have this subtype also have evil alignments; however, if their alignments
          change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this
          subtype as if the creature has an evil alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also
          suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature with the evil subtype overcomes damage reduction
          as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were evil-aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Extraplanar Subtype:</span
        ><span>
          A subtype applied to any creature when it is on a plane other than its native plane. A creature that travels
          the planes can gain or lose this subtype as it goes from plane to plane. Monster entries assume that
          encounters with creatures take place on the Material Plane, and every creature whose native plane is not the
          Material Plane has the extraplanar subtype (but would not have when on its home plane). Every extraplanar
          creature in this book has a home plane mentioned in its description. Creatures not labeled as extraplanar are
          natives of the Material Plane, and they gain the extraplanar subtype if they leave the Material Plane. No
          creature has the extraplanar subtype when it is on a transitive plane, such as the Astral Plane, the 무형의
          Plane, and the Plane of Shadow.</span

          A creature with the fast healing special quality regains 체력 at an exceptionally fast rate, usually 1 or more
          체력 per round, as given in the creature’s entry. Except where noted here, fast healing is just like natural
          healing. Fast healing does not restore 체력 lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does not
          allow a creature to regrow lost body parts. Unless otherwise stated, it does not allow lost body parts to be
          reattached.</span

        If a fear effect allows a 내성 굴림, it is a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 fearsome creature’s racial HD + creature’s
        Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). All fear attacks are mind-affecting
        fear effects.

        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Fire Subtype:</span
        ><span>
          A creature with the fire subtype has immunity to fire. It has vulnerability to cold, which means it takes half
          again as much (+50%) damage as normal from cold, regardless of whether a 내성 굴림 is allowed, or if the save
          is a success or failure.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Flight (Ex or Su):</span
        ><span>
          A creature with this ability can cease or resume flight as a free action. If the ability is supernatural, it
          becomes ineffective in an antimagic field, and the creature loses its ability to fly for as long as the
          antimagic effect persists.</span

      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Frightful Presence (Ex):</span
        ><span>
          This special quality makes a creature’s very presence unsettling to foes. It takes effect automatically when
          the creature performs some sort of dramatic action (such as charging, attacking, or snarling). Opponents
          within range who witness the action may become frightened or shaken. Actions required to trigger the ability
          are given in the creature’s descriptive text. The range is usually 30 feet, and the duration is usually 5d6
          rounds. This ability affects only opponents with fewer Hit Dice or levels than the creature has. An affected
          opponent can resist the effects with a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 frightful creature’s racial HD +
          frightful creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). An opponent that
          succeeds on the 내성 굴림 is immune to that same creature’s frightful presence for 24 hours. Frightful
          presence is a mind-affecting fear effect.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Gaze (Su):</span
        ><span>
          A gaze special attack takes effect when opponents look at the creature’s eyes. The attack can have almost any
          sort of effect: petrification, death, charm, and so on. The typical range is 30 feet, but check the creature’s
          entry for details. The type of 내성 굴림 for 시선 공격 varies, but it is usually a Will or Fortitude save (DC
          10 + 1/2 gazing creature’s racial HD + gazing creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s
          descriptive text). A successful 내성 굴림 negates the effect. A monster’s 시선 공격 is described in
          abbreviated form in its description. Each opponent within range of 시선 공격 must attempt a 내성 굴림 each
          round at the beginning of his or her turn in the initiative order. Only looking directly at a creature with
          시선 공격 leaves an opponent vulnerable. Opponents can avoid the need to make the 내성 굴림 by not looking at
          the creature, in one of two ways.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Averting Eyes: </span
        ><span
          >The opponent avoids looking at the creature’s face, instead looking at its body, watching its shadow,
          tracking it in a reflective surface, and so on. Each round, the opponent has a 50% chance to not need to make
          a 내성 굴림 against 시선 공격. The creature with 시선 공격, however, gains concealment against that
          opponent.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Wearing a Blindfold: </span
        ><span
          >The opponent cannot see the creature at all (also possible to achieve by turning one’s back on the creature
          or shutting one’s eyes). The creature with 시선 공격 gains total concealment against the opponent.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        A creature with 시선 공격 can actively gaze as an attack action by choosing a target within range. That opponent
        must attempt a 내성 굴림 but can try to avoid this as described above. Thus, it is possible for an opponent to
        save against a creature’s gaze twice during the same round, once before the opponent’s action and once during
        the creature’s turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        시선 공격 can affect 무형의 opponents. A creature is immune to 시선 공격 of others of its kind unless otherwise
        noted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Allies of a creature with 시선 공격 might be affected. All the creature’s allies are considered to be averting
        their eyes from the creature with 시선 공격, and have a 50% chance to not need to make a 내성 굴림 against 시선
        공격 each round. The creature also can veil its eyes, thus negating its gaze ability.

          A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the good-aligned Outer Planes. Most creatures that have
          this subtype also have good alignments; however, if their alignments change, they still retain the subtype.
          Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has a good
          alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual
          alignment. A creature with the good subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and any
          weapons it wields were good-aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Improved Grab (Ex):</span
        ><span>
          If a creature with this special attack hits with a melee weapon (usually a claw or bite attack), it deals
          normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. No
          initial touch attack is required. Unless otherwise noted, improved grab works only against opponents at least
          one size category smaller than the creature. The creature has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or
          simply use the part of its body it used in the improved grab to hold the opponent. If it chooses to do the
          latter, it takes a –20 penalty on grapple checks, but is not considered grappled itself; the creature does not
          lose its Dexterity bonus to AC, still threatens an area, and can use its remaining attacks against other
          opponents. A successful hold does not deal any extra damage unless the creature also has the constrict special
          attack. If the creature does not constrict, each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds
          automatically deals the damage indicated for the attack that established the hold. Otherwise, it deals
          constriction damage as well (the amount is given in the creature’s descriptive text). When a creature gets a
          hold after an improved grab attack, it pulls the opponent into its space. This act does not provoke 기회 공격.
          It can even move (possibly carrying away the opponent), provided it can drag the opponent’s weight.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Incorporeal Subtype:</span
        ><span>
          An incorporeal creature has no physical body. It can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic
          weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural
          abilities. It is immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, it has a 50%
          chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy, force
          effects such as <span style="font-style: italic;">magic missile, </span>or attacks made with
          <span style="font-style: italic;">ghost touch </span>weapons). Although it is not a magical attack, holy water
          can affect incorporeal undead, but a hit with holy water has a 50% chance of not affecting an incorporeal
          creature.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        An incorporeal creature has no natural armor bonus but has a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma bonus
        (always at least +1, even if the creature’s Charisma score does not normally provide a bonus).
      </p>
      <p>
        An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid objects, but must remain adjacent to the object’s
        exterior, and so cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than its own. It can sense the
        presence of creatures or objects within a square adjacent to its current location, but enemies have total
        concealment (50% miss chance) from an incorporeal creature that is inside an object. In order to see farther
        from the object it is in and attack normally, the incorporeal creature must emerge. An incorporeal creature
        inside an object has total cover, but when it attacks a creature outside the object it only has cover, so a
        creature outside with a readied action could strike at it as it attacks. An incorporeal creature cannot pass
        through a force effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        An incorporeal creature’s attacks pass through (ignore) natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection
        bonuses and force effects (such as <span style="font-style: italic;">mage armor</span>) work normally against
        it. Incorporeal creatures pass through and operate in water as easily as they do in air. Incorporeal creatures
        cannot fall or take falling damage. Incorporeal creatures cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor can they be
        tripped or grappled. In fact, they cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or
        its equipment, nor are they subject to such actions. Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not set off
        traps that are triggered by weight.
      </p>
      <p>
        An incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesn’t wish to be. It has
        no Strength score, so its Dexterity modifier applies to both its melee attacks and its ranged attacks. Nonvisual
        senses, such as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to incorporeal
        creatures. Incorporeal creatures have an innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when they
        cannot see.

          have this subtype also have lawful alignments; however, if their alignments change, they still retain the
          subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has a
          lawful alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its
          actual alignment. A creature with the lawful subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and
          any weapons it wields were lawful-aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).</span

        ><span>
          Some monsters employ manufactured weapons when they attack. Creatures that use swords, bows, spears, and the
          like follow the same rules as characters, including those for additional attacks from a high base 공격 보너스
          and 쌍수 무기 전투술 penalties. This category also includes “found items,” such as rocks and logs, that a
          creature wields in combat— in essence, any weapon that is not intrinsic to the creature.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Some creatures combine attacks with natural and manufactured weapons when they make a full attack. When they do
        so, the manufactured weapon attack is considered the primary attack unless the creature’s description indicates
        otherwise and any natural weapons the creature also uses are considered secondary natural attacks. These
        secondary attacks do not interfere with the primary attack as attacking with an off-hand weapon does, but they
        take the usual –5 penalty (or –2 with the Multiattack feat) for such attacks, even if the natural weapon used is
        normally the creature’s primary natural weapon.

        —Perfect: The creature can perform almost any aerial maneuver it wishes. It moves through the air as well as a
        human moves over smooth ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        —Good: The creature is very agile in the air (like a housefly or a hummingbird), but cannot change direction as
        readily as those with perfect maneuverability.
      </p>
      <p>—Average: The creature can fly as adroitly as a small bird.</p>
      <p>—Poor: The creature flies as well as a very large bird.</p>
      <p>—Clumsy: The creature can barely maneuver at all.</p>
      <p>
        A creature that flies can make dive attacks. A dive attack works just like a charge, but the diving creature
        must move a minimum of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. It can make only claw or talon attacks, but these
        deal double damage. A creature can use the run action while flying, provided it flies in a straight line.

        <span style="font-style: italic;">Swim: </span
        ><span
          >A creature with a swim speed can move through water at its swim speed without making Swim checks. It has a +8
          racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. The creature can always can
          choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. The creature can use the run action while
          swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Native Subtype:</span
        ><span>
          A subtype applied only to outsiders. These creatures have mortal ancestors or a strong connection to the
          Material Plane and can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living creatures can be.
          Creatures with this subtype are native to the Material Plane (hence the subtype’s name). Unlike true
          outsiders, native outsiders need to eat and sleep.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Natural Weapons:</span
        ><span>
          Natural weapons are weapons that are physically a part of a creature. A creature making a melee attack with a
          natural weapon is considered armed and does not provoke 기회 공격. Likewise, it threatens any space it can
          reach. Creatures do not receive additional attacks from a high base 공격 보너스 when using natural weapons.
          The number of attacks a creature can make with its natural weapons depends on the type of the
          attack—generally, a creature can make one bite attack, one attack per claw or tentacle, one gore attack, one
          sting attack, or one slam attack (although Large creatures with arms or arm-like limbs can make a slam attack
          with each arm). Refer to the individual monster descriptions.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>Unless otherwise noted, a natural weapon threatens a critical hit on a natural 명중 굴림 of 20.</p>
      <p>
        When a creature has more than one natural weapon, one of them (or sometimes a pair or set of them) is the
        primary weapon. All the creature’s remaining natural weapons are secondary.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary weapon is given in the creature’s Attack entry, and the primary weapon or weapons is given first in
        the creature’s Full Attack entry. A creature’s primary natural weapon is its most effective natural attack,
        usually by virtue of the creature’s physiology, training, or innate talent with the weapon. An attack with a
        primary natural weapon uses the creature’s full 공격 보너스. Attacks with secondary natural weapons are less
        effective and are made with a –5 penalty on the 명중 굴림, no matter how many there are. (Creatures with the
        Multiattack feat take only a –2 penalty on secondary attacks.) This penalty applies even when the creature makes
        a single attack with the secondary weapon as part of the attack action or as an attack of opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>Natural weapons have types just as other weapons do. The most common are summarized below.</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Bite: </span
        ><span>The creature attacks with its mouth, dealing piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Claw or Talon: </span
        ><span>The creature rips with a sharp appendage, dealing piercing and slashing damage.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Gore: </span
        ><span
          >The creature spears the opponent with an antler, horn, or similar appendage, dealing piercing damage.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Slap or Slam: </span
        ><span>The creature batters opponents with an appendage, dealing bludgeoning damage.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Sting: </span
        ><span
          >The creature stabs with a stinger, dealing piercing damage. Sting attacks usually deal damage from poison in
          addition to 체력 damage.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Tentacle: </span
        ><span
          >The creature flails at opponents with a powerful tentacle, dealing bludgeoning (and sometimes slashing)
          damage.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Nonabilities:</span
        ><span>
          Some creatures lack certain 능력치 점수. These creatures do not have an ability score of 0—they lack the
          ability altogether. The modifier for a nonability is +0. Other effects of nonabilities are detailed
          below.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Strength: </span
        ><span
          >Any creature that can physically manipulate other objects has at least 1 point of Strength. A creature with
          no Strength score can’t exert force, usually because it has no physical body or because it doesn’t move. The
          creature automatically fails Strength checks. If the creature can attack, it applies its Dexterity modifier to
          its base 공격 보너스 instead of a Strength modifier.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Dexterity: </span
        ><span
          >Any creature that can move has at least 1 point of Dexterity. A creature with no Dexterity score can’t move.
          If it can perform actions (such as casting spells), it applies its Intelligence modifier to 선제권 판정
          instead of a Dexterity modifier. The creature automatically fails Reflex saves and Dexterity checks.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Constitution: </span
        ><span
          >Any living creature has at least 1 point of Constitution. A creature with no Constitution has no body or no
          metabolism. It is immune to any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless the effect works on objects or is
          harmless. The creature is also immune to ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain, and automatically
          fails Constitution checks. A creature with no Constitution cannot tire and thus can run indefinitely without
          tiring (unless the creature’s description says it cannot run).</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Intelligence: </span
        ><span
          >Any creature that can think, learn, or remember has at least 1 point of Intelligence. A creature with no
          Intelligence score is mindless, an automaton operating on simple instincts or programmed instructions. It has
          immunity to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) and
          automatically fails Intelligence checks.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>Mindless creatures do not gain 특기 or skills, although they may have bonus 특기 or racial skill bonuses.</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Wisdom: </span
        ><span
          >Any creature that can perceive its environment in any fashion has at least 1 point of Wisdom. Anything with
          no Wisdom score is an object, not a creature. Anything without a Wisdom score also has no Charisma

        >
      </p>

        <span style="font-style: italic;">Charisma: </span
        ><span
          >Any creature capable of telling the difference between itself and things that are not itself has at least 1
          point of Charisma. Anything with no Charisma score is an object, not a creature. Anything without a Charisma

      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Ooze Type:</span
        ><span> An ooze is an amorphous or mutable creature, usually mindless.</span>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        —Mindless: No Intelligence score, and immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms,
        patterns, and morale effects).
      </p>
      <p>
        —Blind (but have the blindsight special quality), with immunity to 시선 공격, visual effects, illusions, and
        other attack forms that rely on sight.
      </p>
      <p>—Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorph, and stunning.</p>
      <p>
        —Some oozes have the ability to deal acid damage to objects. In such a case, the amount of damage is equal to 10
        + 1/2 ooze’s HD + ooze’s Con modifier per full round of contact.
      </p>
      <p>—Not subject to critical hits or flanking.</p>

      <p>—Oozes eat and breathe, but do not sleep.</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Outsider Type: </span
        ><span
          >An outsider is at least partially composed of the essence (but not necessarily the material) of some plane
          other than the Material Plane. Some creatures start out as some other type and become outsiders when they

      <p>—암흑시야 out to 60 feet.</p>
      <p>
        —Unlike most other living creatures, an outsider does not have a dual nature—its soul and body form one unit.
        When an outsider is slain, no soul is set loose. Spells that restore souls to their bodies, such as
        <span style="font-style: italic;">raise dead, reincarnate, </span>and
        <span style="font-style: italic;">resurrection, </span>don’t work on an outsider. It takes a different magical
        effect, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">limited wish, wish, miracle, </span>or
        <span style="font-style: italic;">true resurrection </span>to restore it to life. An outsider with the native
        subtype can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living creatures can be.
      </p>
      <p>—Proficient with all simple and martial weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry.</p>
      <p>
        —Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all
        lighter types. Outsiders not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Outsiders are proficient
        with shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.
      </p>
      <p>
        —Outsiders breathe, but do not need to eat or sleep (although they can do so if they wish). Native outsiders
        breathe, eat, and sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Paralysis (Ex or Su): </span
        ><span
          >This special attack renders the victim immobile. Paralyzed creatures cannot move, speak, or take any physical
          actions. The creature is rooted to the spot, frozen and helpless. Paralysis works on the body, and a character
          can usually resist it with a Fortitude 내성 굴림 (the DC is given in the creature’s description). Unlike
          <span style="font-style: italic;">hold person </span>and similar effects, a paralysis effect does not allow a
          new save each round. A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it is paralyzed cannot flap its
          wings and falls. A swimmer can’t swim and may drown.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Plant Type:</span
        ><span>
          This type comprises vegetable creatures. Note that regular plants, such as one finds growing in gardens and
          fields, lack Wisdom and Charisma scores (see Nonabilities, above) and are not creatures, but objects, even
          though they are alive.

        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Poison (Ex):</span
        ><span>
          Poison attacks deal initial damage, such as ability damage (see page 305) or some other effect, to the
          opponent on a failed Fortitude save. Unless otherwise noted, another 내성 굴림 is required 1 minute later
          (regardless of the first save’s result) to avoid secondary damage. A creature’s descriptive text provides the
          details.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>A creature with a poison attack is immune to its own poison and the poison of others of its kind.</p>

        creature’s Con modifier (the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text).
      </p>
      <p>A successful save avoids (negates) the damage.</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Pounce (Ex):</span
        ><span>
          When a creature with this special attack makes a charge, it can follow with a full attack—including rake
          attacks if the creature also has the rake ability.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Powerful Charge (Ex):</span
        ><span>
          When a creature with this special attack makes a charge, its attack deals extra damage in addition to the
          normal benefits and hazards of a charge. The amount of damage from the attack is given in the creature’s
          description.</span
        >

          usually usable at will.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Rake (Ex):</span
        ><span>
          A creature with this special attack gains extra natural attacks when it grapples its foe. Normally, a monster
          can attack with only one of its natural weapons while grappling, but a monster with the rake ability usually
          gains two additional claw attacks that it can use only against a grappled foe. Rake attacks are not subject to
          the usual –4 penalty for attacking with a natural weapon in a grapple.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        A monster with the rake ability must begin its turn grappling to use its rake—it can’t begin a grapple and rake
        in the same turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Ray (Su or Sp):</span
        ><span>
          This form of special attack works like a ranged attack. Hitting with a ray attack requires a successful ranged
          touch 명중 굴림, ignoring armor, natural armor, and shield and using the creature’s ranged 공격 보너스. Ray
          attacks have no range increment. The creature’s descriptive text specifies the maximum range, effects, and any
          applicable 내성 굴림.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Regeneration (Ex): </span
        ><span
          >A creature with this ability is difficult to kill. Damage dealt to the creature is treated as 비치명적인
          피해. The creature automatically heals 비치명적인 피해 at a fixed rate per round, as given in the entry.
          Certain attack forms, typically fire and acid, deal lethal damage to the creature, which doesn’t go away. The
          creature’s descriptive text describes the details. A regenerating creature that has been rendered unconscious
          through 비치명적인 피해 can be killed with a coup de grace. The attack cannot be of a type that automatically
          converts to 비치명적인 피해.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Attack forms that don’t deal 체력 damage ignore regeneration. Regeneration also does not restore 체력 lost from
        starvation, thirst, or suffocation. Regenerating creatures can regrow lost portions of their bodies and can
        reattach severed limbs or body parts; details are in the creature’s descriptive text. Severed parts that are not
        reattached wither and die normally.
      </p>
      <p>A creature must have a Constitution score to have the regeneration ability.</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Reptilian Subtype: </span
        ><span
          >These creatures are scaly and usually coldblooded. The reptilian subtype is only used to describe a set of
          humanoid races, not all animals and monsters that are truly reptiles.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Resistance to Energy (Ex):</span
        ><span>
          A creature with this special quality ignores some damage of the indicated type each time it takes damage of
          that kind (commonly acid, cold, fire, or electricity). The entry indicates the amount and type of damage
          ignored.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Scent (Ex):</span
        ><span>
          This special quality allows a creature to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by
          sense of smell. Creatures with the scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar
          sights.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range
        increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be
        detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be
        detected at triple normal range.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a creature detects a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed—only its presence somewhere
        within range. The creature can take a move action to note the direction of the scent.
      </p>
      <p>Whenever the creature comes within 5 feet of the source, the creature pinpoints the source’s location.</p>
      <p>
        A creature with the Track feat and the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival)
        check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds
        the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s odor is, the number of
        creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability
        otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface
        conditions and poor visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Shapechanger Subtype:</span

          A shapechanger has the supernatural ability to assume one or more alternate forms. Many magical effects allow
          some kind of shape shifting, and not every creature that can change shapes has the shapechanger subtype.

        ><span>
          Unless otherwise noted, a sonic attack follows the rules for spreads. The range of the spread is measured from
          the creature using the sonic attack. Once a sonic attack has taken effect, deafening the subject or stopping
          its ears does not end the effect. Stopping one’s ears ahead of time allows opponents to avoid having to make
          내성 굴림 against mind-affecting sonic attacks, but not other kinds of sonic attacks (such as those that deal
          damage). Stopping one’s ears is a full-round action and requires wax or other soundproof material to stuff
          into the ears.</span

        >
      </p>
      <p>
        A spell-like ability usually has a limit on how often it can be used. A spell-like ability that can be used at
        will has no use limit. Using a spell-like ability is a standard action unless noted otherwise, and doing so
        while threatened provokes 기회 공격. It is possible to make a Concentration check to use a spell-like ability
        defensively and avoid provoking an attack of opportunity, just as when casting a spell. A spell-like ability can
        be disrupted just as a spell can be. Spell-like abilities cannot be used to counterspell, nor can they be
        counterspelled.
      </p>
      <p>
        For creatures with spell-like abilities, a designated caster level defines how difficult it is to dispel their
        spell-like effects and to define any level-dependent variables (such as range and duration) the abilities might
        have. The creature’s caster level never affects which spell-like abilities the creature has; sometimes the given
        caster level is lower than the level a spellcasting character would need to cast the spell of the same name. If
        no caster level is specified, the caster level is equal to the creature’s Hit Dice. The 내성 굴림 (if any)
        against a spell-like ability is 10 + the level of the spell the ability resembles or duplicates + the creature’s
        Cha modifier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some spell-like abilities duplicate spells that work differently when cast by characters of different
        classes<span style="font-style: italic;">. </span>A monster’s spell-like abilities are presumed to be the
        sorcerer/wizard versions. If the spell in question is not a sorcerer/wizard spell, then default to cleric,
        druid, bard, paladin, and ranger, in that order.

          abilities cannot be dispelled. Using a supernatural ability is a standard action unless noted otherwise.
          Supernatural abilities may have a use limit or be usable at will, just like spell-like abilities. However,
          supernatural abilities do not provoke 기회 공격 and never require Concentration checks. Unless otherwise
          noted, a supernatural ability has an effective caster level equal to the creature’s Hit Dice. The 내성 굴림
          (if any) against a supernatural ability is 10 + 1/2 the creature’s HD + the creature’s 능력 수정치 (usually
          Charisma).</span

          This works exactly like spell resistance, except that it cannot be overcome. Sometimes spell immunity is
          conditional or applies to only spells of a certain kind or level. Spells that do not allow spell resistance

        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Spells:</span
        ><span>
          Sometimes a creature can cast arcane or divine spells just as a member of a spellcasting class can (and can
          activate magic items accordingly). Such creatures are subject to the same spellcasting rules that characters
          are, except as follows.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        A spellcasting creature that lacks hands or arms can provide any somatic component a spell might require by
        moving its body. Such a creature also does need material components for its spells. The creature can cast the
        spell by either touching the required component (but not if the component is in another creature’s possession)
        or having the required component on its person. Sometimes spellcasting creatures utilize the 구성요소 무시 feat
        to avoid fussing with noncostly components.
      </p>
      <p>
        A spellcasting creature is not actually a member of a class unless its entry says so, and it does not gain any
        class abilities. A creature with access to cleric spells must prepare them in the normal manner and receives
        domain spells if noted, but it does not receive domain granted powers unless it has at least one level in the
        cleric class.

          but it usually has only a limited chance of success (as specified in the creature’s entry). Roll d%: On a
          failure, no creature answers the summons. Summoned creatures automatically return whence they came after 1
          hour. A creature that has just been summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. Most creatures with
          the ability to summon do not use it lightly, since it leaves them beholden to the summoned creature. In
          general, they use it only when necessary to save their own lives. An appropriate spell level is given for each
          summoning ability for purposes of Concentration checks and attempts to dispel the summoned creature. No
          experience points are awarded for summoned monsters.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Swallow Whole (Ex):</span
        ><span>
          If a creature with this special attack begins its turn with an opponent held in its mouth (see Improved Grab),
          it can attempt a new grapple check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If it succeeds, it swallows its
          prey, and the opponent takes bite damage. Unless otherwise noted, the opponent can be up to one size category
          smaller than the swallowing creature. Being swallowed has various consequences, depending on the creature
          doing the swallowing. A swallowed creature is considered to be grappled, while the creature that did the
          swallowing is not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon
          (the amount of cutting damage required to get free is noted in the creature description), or it can just try
          to escape the grapple. The 방어도 of the interior of a creature that swallows whole is normally 10 + 1/2 its
          natural armor bonus, with no modifiers for size or Dexterity. If the swallowed creature escapes the grapple,
          success puts it back in the attacker’s mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.</span

          A swarm is a collection of Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures that acts as a single creature. A swarm has the
          characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A swarm has a single pool of Hit Dice and 체력, a single
          initiative modifier, a single speed, and a single 방어도. A swarm makes 내성 굴림 as a single creature. A
          single swarm occupies a square (if it is made up of nonflying creatures) or a cube (of flying creatures) 10
          feet on a side, but its reach is 0 feet, like its component creatures. In order to attack, it moves into an
          opponent’s space, which provokes an attack of opportunity. It can occupy the same space as a creature of any
          size, since it crawls all over its prey. A swarm can move through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa
          without impediment, although the swarm provokes an attack of opportunity if it does so. A swarm can move
          through cracks or holes large enough for its component creatures.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures or 1,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive
        creatures consists of 1,500 nonflying creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Fine creatures consists of
        10,000 creatures, whether they are flying or not. Swarms of nonflying creatures include many more creatures than
        could normally fit in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because creatures in a swarm are packed
        tightly together and generally crawl over each other and their prey when moving or attacking. Larger swarms are
        represented by multiples of single swarms. The area occupied by a large swarm is completely shapeable, though
        the swarm usually remains in contiguous squares.

          >A swarm has no clear front or back and no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or
          flanking. A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes half damage from slashing and piercing weapons. A swarm
          composed of Fine or Diminutive creatures is immune to all weapon damage. Reducing a swarm to 0 체력 or lower
          causes it to break up, though damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist
          attack. Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be tripped,
          grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple an opponent.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target
        spells such as <span style="font-style: italic;">disintegrate</span>), with the exception of mind-affecting
        effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) if the swarm has an Intelligence score
        and a hive mind. A swarm takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such
        as 비산 무기 and many evocation spells.
      </p>
      <p>
        Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are susceptible to high winds such as that created by a
        <span style="font-style: italic;">gust of wind </span>spell. For purposes of determining the effects of wind on
        a swarm, treat the swarm as a creature of the same size as its constituent creatures. A swarm rendered
        unconscious by means of 비치명적인 피해 becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not reform until its 체력
        exceed its 비치명적인 피해.

          As a full-round action, a creature with this special attack can move up to twice its speed and literally run
          over any opponents at least one size category smaller than itself. The creature merely has to move over the
          opponents in its path; any creature whose space is completely covered by the trampling creature’s space is
          subject to the trample attack. If a target’s space is larger than 5 feet, it is only considered trampled if
          the trampling creature moves over all the squares it occupies. If the trampling creature moves over only some
          of a target’s space, the target can make an attack of opportunity against the trampling creature at a –4
          penalty. A trampling creature that accidentally ends its movement in an illegal space returns to the last
          legal position it occupied, or the closest legal position, if there’s a legal position that’s closer.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 700;">전리품:</span
        ><span>
          This entry in a monster description describes how much wealth a creature owns. In most cases, a creature keeps
          valuables in its home or lair and has no 전리품 with it when it travels. Intelligent creatures that own
          useful, portable 전리품 (such as magic items) tend to carry and use these, leaving bulky items at home.
          전리품 can include coins, goods, and items. Creatures can have varying amounts of each, as follows.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Standard: </span
        ><span
          >Refer to 전리품 tablesand roll d% once for each type of 전리품 (Coins, Goods, Items) on the Level
          section of the table that corresponds to the creature’s 도전 지수 (for groups of creatures, use the
          Encounter Level for the encounter instead). Some creatures have double, triple, or even quadruple standard
          전리품; in these cases, roll for each type of 전리품 two, three, or four times.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">None: </span><span>The creature collects no 전리품 of its own.</span></p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Nonstandard: </span
        ><span
          >Some creatures have quirks or habits that affect the types of 전리품 they collect. These creatures use the
          same</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>전리품 tables, but with special adjustments.</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Fractional Coins: </span
        ><span
          >Roll on the Coins column in the section corresponding to the creature’s 도전 지수, but divide the
          result as indicated.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">% Goods or Items: </span
        ><span
          >The creature has goods or items only some of the time. Before checking for goods or items, roll d% against
          the given percentage. On a success, make a normal roll on the appropriate Goods or Items column (which may
          still result in no goods or items).</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Double Goods or Items: </span
        ><span>Roll twice on the appropriate Goods or Items column.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Parenthetical Notes: </span
        ><span
          >Some entries for goods or items include notes that limit the types of 전리품 a creature collects.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        When a note includes the word “no,” it means the creature does not collect or cannot keep that thing. If a
        random roll generates such a result, treat the result as “none” instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a note includes the word “only,” the creature goes out of its way to collect 전리품 of the indicated
        type. Treat all results from that column as the indicated type of 전리품.
      </p>
      <p>It’s sometimes necessary to reroll until the right sort of item appears.</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Turn Resistance (Ex): </span
        ><span
          >A creature with this special quality (usually an undead) is less easily affected by clerics or paladins. When
          resolving a turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempt, add the indicated number to the creature’s Hit Dice
          total.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Undead Type:</span
        ><span> Undead are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Features: </span><span>An undead creature has the following features.</span>
      </p>
      <p>—12-sided Hit Dice.</p>
      <p>—Base 공격 보너스 equal to 1/2 total Hit Dice (as wizard).</p>
      <p>—Good Will saves.</p>
      <p>
        —Skill points equal to (4 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
        Die, if the undead creature has an Intelligence score. However, many undead are mindless and gain no skill
        points or 특기.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Traits: </span
        ><span>An undead creature possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</span>
      </p>
      <p>—No Constitution score.</p>
      <p>—암흑시야 out to 60 feet.</p>
      <p>—Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).</p>

        —Cannot heal damage on its own if it has no Intelligence score, although it can be healed. Negative energy (such
        as an <span style="font-style: italic;">inflict </span>spell) can heal undead creatures. The fast healing
        special quality works regardless of the creature’s Intelligence score.
      </p>
      <p>
        —Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless).
      </p>
      <p>—Uses its Charisma modifier for Concentration checks.</p>

      <p>—Proficient with its natural weapons, all simple weapons, and any weapons mentioned in its entry.</p>
      <p>
        —Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all
        lighter types. Undead not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Undead are proficient with

        ><span> This type includes insects, arachnids, other arthropods, worms, and similar invertebrates.</span>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Features: </span><span>Vermin have the following features.</span></p>
      <p>—8-sided Hit Dice.</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        —Mindless: No Intelligence score, and immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms,
        patterns, and morale effects).

          creature takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from the effect, regardless of whether a 내성 굴림
          is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Water Subtype:</span

An affected opponent takes a –1 penalty on all 스킬 판정 and ability checks, 명중 굴림, and 내성 굴림,\n          and loses one effective level or Hit Die (whenever level is used in a die roll or calculation) for each\n          negative level.

The creature has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or\n          simply use the part of its body it used in the improved grab to hold the opponent. If it chooses to do the\n          latter, it takes a –20 penalty on grapple checks, but is not considered grappled itself; the creature does not\n          lose its Dexterity bonus to AC, still threatens an area, and can use its remaining attacks against other\n          opponents.

It can sense the\n        presence of creatures or objects within a square adjacent to its current location, but enemies have total\n        concealment (50% miss chance) from an incorporeal creature that is inside an object. In order to see farther\n        from the object it is in and attack normally, the incorporeal creature must emerge. An incorporeal creature\n        inside an object has total cover, but when it attacks a creature outside the object it only has cover, so a\n        creature outside with a readied action could strike at it as it attacks.

Incorporeal creatures cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor can they be\n        tripped or grappled. In fact, they cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or\n        its equipment, nor are they subject to such actions.

A creature making a melee attack with a\n          natural weapon is considered armed and does not provoke 기회 공격. Likewise, it threatens any space it can\n          reach. Creatures do not receive additional attacks from a high base 공격 보너스 when using natural weapons.\n          The number of attacks a creature can make with its natural weapons depends on the type of the\n          attack—generally, a creature can make one bite attack, one attack per claw or tentacle, one gore attack, one\n          sting attack, or one slam attack (although Large creatures with arms or arm-like limbs can make a slam attack\n          with each arm).

A swarm makes 내성 굴림 as a single creature. A\n          single swarm occupies a square (if it is made up of nonflying creatures) or a cube (of flying creatures) 10\n          feet on a side, but its reach is 0 feet, like its component creatures. In order to attack, it moves into an\n          opponent’s space, which provokes an attack of opportunity. It can occupy the same space as a creature of any\n          size, since it crawls all over its prey. A swarm can move through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa\n          without impediment, although the swarm provokes an attack of opportunity if it does so. A swarm can move\n          through cracks or holes large enough for its component creatures.\u003c/span\n        \u003e\n      \u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e\n        A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures or 1,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive\n        creatures consists of 1,500 nonflying creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Fine creatures consists of\n        10,000 creatures, whether they are flying or not. Swarms of nonflying creatures include many more creatures than\n        could normally fit in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because creatures in a swarm are packed\n        tightly together and generally crawl over each other and their prey when moving or attacking. Larger swarms are\n        represented by multiples of single swarms.
