class="Layout_main__3m1yK"><div><p>This material is Open
Game Content, and is licensed for public use under the terms of the Open Game
License v1.0a.</p><section id="h1-0-magic-overview"><h1>마법 개요</h1><div class="original-headline">MAGIC OVERVIEW</div><p>A
spell is a one-time magical effect. 주문 come in two types: arcane (cast by
음유시인, 소서러, and 마법사) and 신성 (cast by 사제, 드루이드, and
experienced 성기사 and 레인저). Some spellcasters select their 주문 from a
limited list of 주문 known, while others have access to a wide variety of
options.</p><p>Most
spellcasters prepare their 주문 in advance—whether from a spellbook or
through devout 기도 and meditation— while some cast 주문 spontaneously
without preparation.</p><p>Despite
these different ways that characters use to learn or prepare their 주문, when
it comes to casting them, the 주문 are very much alike.</p><p>Cutting across
the categories of arcane and 신성 주문 are the eight 학파 of magic.
These 학파 represent the different ways that 주문 take effect.</p><section id="h2-1-casting-spells"><h2>주문 시전하기</h2><div class="original-headline">CASTING
SPELLS</div><p>Whether
a spell is arcane or 신성, and whether a character prepares 주문 in advance
or chooses them on the 감지, casting a spell works the same way.</p><section id="h3-2-choosing-a-spell"><h3>주문 선택하기</h3><div class="original-headline">CHOOSING A SPELL</div><p>First
you must choose which spell to cast. If you’re a 사제, 드루이드, experienced
성기사, experienced 레인저, or 마법사, you select from among 주문 prepared
earlier in the day and not yet cast (see 마법사 주문 준비 and 신성 주문 준비).</p><p>If
you’re a 음유시인 or 소서러, you can select any spell you know, provided you are
capable of 주문 시전하기 of that 레벨 or higher.</p><p>To
주문 시전, you must be able to 말하기 (if the spell has a verbal component),
gesture (if it has a somatic component), and manipulate the material 구성요소
or focus (if any). Additionally, you must concentrate to 주문 시전.</p><p>If
a spell has multiple versions, you choose which version to use when you cast
it. You don’t have to prepare (or learn, in the case of a 음유시인 or 소서러) a
specific version of the spell.</p><p>Once
you’ve cast a prepared spell, you can’t cast it again until you prepare it
again. (If you’ve prepared multiple copies of a single spell, you can cast each
copy once.) If you’re a 음유시인 or 소서러, casting a spell counts against your
daily limit for 주문 of that spell 레벨, but you can cast the same spell
again if you haven’t reached your limit.</p></section><section id="h3-3-concentration"><h3>집중</h3><div class="original-headline">CONCENTRATION</div><p>To
주문 시전, you must concentrate. If something interrupts your 집중
while you’re casting, you must make a 집중 check or lose the spell.
The more distracting the interruption and the higher the 레벨 of the spell you
are trying to cast, the higher the DC is. If you fail the check, you lose the
spell just as if you had cast it to no effect.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Injury:</span><span> If while trying to 주문 시전 you take 피해, you must make a 집중 check (DC 10 + points of
피해 taken + the 레벨 of the spell you’re casting). If you fail the check,
you lose the spell without effect. The interrupting event strikes during
spellcasting if it comes between when you start and when you complete a spell
(for a spell with a 시전 시간 of 1 full round or more) or if it comes in
response to your casting the spell (such as an 공격 of opportunity provoked
by the spell or a contingent 공격, such as a readied action).</span></p><p>If
you are taking continuous 피해 half the 피해 is considered to take place
while you are casting a spell. You must make a 집중 check (DC 10 + 1/2
the 피해 that the continuous source last dealt + the 레벨 of the spell
you’re casting). If the last 피해 dealt was the last 피해 that the effect
could deal then the 피해 is over, and it does not 주의산만 you.</p><p>Repeated
피해 does not count as continuous 피해.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell:
</span><span>If you
are affected by a spell while attempting to 주문 시전 of your own, you must
make a 집중 check or lose the spell you are casting. If the spell
affecting you deals 피해, the DC is 10 + points of 피해 + the 레벨 of the
spell you’re casting.</span></p><p>If
the spell interferes with you or 주의산만 you in some other way, the DC is the
spell’s 내성 굴림 DC + the 레벨 of the spell you’re casting. For a spell
with no 내성 굴림, it’s the DC that the spell’s 내성 굴림 would have if a
save were allowed.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Grappling
or Pinned:</span><span>
The only 주문 you can cast while grappling or pinned are those without
somatic 구성요소 and whose material 구성요소 (if any) you have in hand.
Even so, you must make a 집중 check (DC 20 + the 레벨 of the spell
you’re casting) or lose the spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Vigorous
Motion:</span><span>
If you are riding on a moving 탈것 소환, taking a bouncy 탑승 in a wagon, on a
small boat in rough water, below-decks in a storm-tossed ship, or simply being
jostled in a similar fashion, you must make a 집중 check (DC 10 + the
레벨 of the spell you’re casting) or lose the spell. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Violent
Motion: </span><span>If
you are on a galloping 말, taking a very rough 탑승 in a wagon, on a small
boat in rapids or in a storm, on deck in a storm-tossed ship, or being tossed
roughly about in a similar fashion, you must make a 집중 check (DC 15
+ the 레벨 of the spell you’re casting) or lose the spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Violent
날씨: </span><span>You
must make a 집중 check if you try to 주문 시전 in violent 날씨.
If you are in a high wind carrying blinding rain or sleet, the DC is 5 + the
레벨 of the spell you’re casting. If you are in wind-driven hail, dust, or
debris, the DC is 10 + the 레벨 of the spell you’re casting. In either case,
you lose the spell if you fail the 집중 check. If the 날씨 is
caused by a spell, use the rules in the Spell subsection above.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Casting
Defensively:</span><span>
If you want to 주문 시전 without provoking any 기회 공격, you
must make a 집중 check (DC 15 + the 레벨 of the spell you’re casting)
to succeed. You lose the spell if you fail.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Entangled:</span><span> If you want to 주문 시전
while entangled in a net or by a tanglefoot bag or while you’re affected by a
spell with similar effects, you must make a DC 15 집중 check to cast
the spell. You lose the spell if you fail.</span></p></section><section id="h3-4-counterspells"><h3>주문 무효화</h3><div class="original-headline">COUNTERSPELLS</div><p>It
is possible to cast any spell as a counterspell. By doing so, you are using the
spell’s energy to disrupt the casting of the same spell by another character.
Counterspelling works even if one spell is 신성 and the other arcane.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">How
주문 무효화 Work: </span><span>To use a counterspell, you must select an opponent as the
target of the counterspell. You do this by choosing the 준비 action. In doing
so, you elect to wait to complete your action until your opponent tries to 주문 시전. (You may still 이동 your 속도, since 준비 is a standard action.)</span></p><p>If
the target of your counterspell tries to 주문 시전, make a 주문학 check
(DC 15 + the spell’s 레벨). This check is a free action. If the check
succeeds, you correctly 식별 the opponent’s spell and can attempt to
counter it. If the check fails, you can’t do either of these things.</p><p>To
complete the action, you must then cast the correct spell. As a general rule, a
spell can only counter itself. If you are able to cast the same spell and you
have it prepared (if you prepare 주문), you cast it, altering it slightly to
create a counterspell effect. If the target is within 거리, both 주문
automatically negate each other with no other results.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Counterspelling
메타마법 주문:</span><span> 메타마법 특기 are not taken into account when determining
whether a spell can be countered</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Specific
Exceptions:</span><span>
Some 주문 specifically counter each other, especially when they have
diametrically opposed effects.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 700;">마법 무효화 </span><span style="font-weight: 700;">as
a Counterspell:</span><span>
You can use <span style="font-style: italic;">마법 무효화 </span>to counterspell another spellcaster, and you
don’t need to 식별 the spell he or she is casting. However, <span style="font-style: italic;">마법 무효화
</span>doesn’t always work as a counterspell (see the spell 묘사).</span></p></section><section id="h3-5-caster-level"><h3>시전자 레벨</h3><div class="original-headline">CASTER LEVEL</div><p>A
spell’s power often depends on its 시전자 레벨, which for most spellcasting
characters is equal to your class 레벨 in the class you’re using to cast the
spell. </p><p>You
can 주문 시전 at a lower 시전자 레벨 than normal, but the 시전자 레벨 you
choose must be high enough for you to cast the spell in question, and all
레벨-dependent features must be based on the same 시전자 레벨. </p><p>In
the event that a class feature, domain granted power, or other special ability
provides an adjustment to your 시전자 레벨, that adjustment applies not only
to effects based on 시전자 레벨 (such as 거리, 지속시간, and 피해 dealt)
but also to your 시전자 레벨 check to overcome your target’s 주문 저항
and to the 시전자 레벨 used in dispel checks (both the dispel check and the DC
of the check). </p></section><section id="h3-6-spell-failure"><h3>주문 실패</h3><div class="original-headline">SPELL FAILURE</div><p>If
you ever try to 주문 시전 in 상태이상 where the characteristics of the
spell cannot be made to conform, the casting fails and the spell is wasted.</p><p>주문
also fail if your 집중 is broken and might fail if you’re wearing
갑옷 while casting a spell with somatic 구성요소.</p></section><section id="h3-7-the-spell-s-result"><h3>주문의 결과</h3><div class="original-headline">THE SPELL’S RESULT</div><p>Once
you know which creatures (or objects or 범위) are affected, and whether those
creatures have made successful 내성 굴림 (if any were allowed), you can
apply whatever results a spell entails.</p></section><section id="h3-8-special-spell-effects"><h3>특수 주문 효과</h3><div class="original-headline">SPECIAL SPELL
EFFECTS</div><p>Many
특수 주문 효과 are handled according to the 학파 of the 주문 in
question Certain other special spell features are found across spell 학파.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">공격:</span><span> Some 주문 설명
refer to attacking. All offensive 전투 actions, even those that don’t 피해
opponents are considered 공격. Attempts to 언데드 퇴치 count as
공격. All 주문 that opponents resist with 내성 굴림, that deal 피해,
or that otherwise 해악 or hamper subjects are 공격. 주문 that summon
몬스터 or other allies are not 공격 because the 주문 themselves don’t
해악 anyone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Bonus
Types:</span><span>
Usually, a bonus has a type that indicates how the spell grants the bonus. The
important aspect of bonus types is that two bonuses of the same type don’t
generally stack. With the exception of 회피 bonuses, most circumstance
bonuses, and racial bonuses, only the better bonus works (see 주문 효과 조합하기, below). The same principle applies to penalties—a character taking two
or more penalties of the same type applies only the worst one.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Bringing
Back the 죽음:</span><span>
Several 주문 have the power to restore slain characters to life.</span></p><p>When
a living creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves 물질 세계,
travels through 영적 세계, and goes to abide on the plane where the
creature’s deity resides. If the creature did not worship a deity, its soul
departs to the plane corresponding to its 성향. Bringing someone back from
the 죽음 means retrieving his or her soul and returning it to his or her body.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">레벨 손실: </span><span>Any
creature brought back to life usually loses one 레벨 of experience. The character’s
new XP total is midway between the minimum needed for his or her new (reduced)
레벨 and the minimum needed for the next one. If the character was 1 레벨
at the time of death, he or she loses 2 points of 건강 instead of
losing a 레벨.</span></p><p>This
레벨 손실 or 건강 loss cannot be repaired by any mortal means, even <span style="font-style: italic;">소원
</span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">기적. </span>A revived character can regain a lost 레벨 by earning
XP through further adventuring. A revived character who was 1 레벨 at the
time of death can regain lost points of 건강 by improving his or her
건강 score when he or she attains a 레벨 that allows an ability score
increase.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Preventing
Revivification: </span><span>Enemies
can take steps to make it more difficult for a character to be returned from
the 죽음. Keeping the body prevents others from using <span style="font-style: italic;">시체 되살리기 </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">부활
</span>to restore the slain character to life. Casting <span style="font-style: italic;">영혼의 덫 </span>prevents
any sort of revivification unless the soul is first released.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Revivification
against One’s Will: </span><span>A soul cannot be returned to life if it does not 소원 to be.
A soul knows the 이름, 성향, and patron deity (if any) of the character
attempting to revive it and may refuse to return on that basis.</span></p></section><section id="h3-9-combining-magical-effects"><h3>주문 효과 조합하기</h3><div class="original-headline">COMBINING MAGICAL
EFFECTS</div><p>주문
or magical effects usually work as described, no matter how many other 주문
or magical effects happen to be operating in the same 범위 or on the same
recipient. Except in special cases, a spell does not affect the way another
spell operates. Whenever a spell has a specific effect on other 주문, the
spell 묘사 explains that effect. Several other general rules apply when
주문 or magical effects operate in the same place:</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Stacking
Effects:</span><span> 주문
that provide bonuses or penalties on 명중 굴림, 피해 rolls, 내성 굴림,
and other attributes usually do not stack with themselves. More generally, two
bonuses of the same type don’t stack even if they come from different 주문
(or from effects other than 주문; see Bonus Types, above). </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Different
Bonus 이름: </span><span>The
bonuses or penalties from two different 주문 stack if the modifiers are of
different types. A bonus that isn’t named stacks with any bonus.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Same
Effect More than Once in Different 근력: </span><span>In cases when two or more identical
주문 are operating in the same 범위 or on the same target, but at different
근력, only the best one applies.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Same
Effect with Differing Results: </span><span>The same spell can sometimes produce varying effects
if applied to the same recipient more than once. Usually the last spell in the
series trumps the others. None of the previous 주문 are actually removed or
dispelled, but their effects become irrelevant while the final spell in the
series lasts.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">One
Effect Makes Another Irrelevant: </span><span>Sometimes, one spell can render a later spell
irrelevant. Both 주문 are still active, but one has rendered the other
useless in some fashion.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Multiple
Mental Control Effects: </span><span>Sometimes magical effects that establish mental control
render each other irrelevant, such as a spell that removes the subjects ability
to act. Mental controls that don’t remove the recipient’s ability to act
usually do not interfere with each other. If a creature is under the mental
control of two or more creatures, it tends to obey each to the best of its
ability, and to the extent of the control each effect allows. If the controlled
creature receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the competing controllers
must make opposed 매력 checks to determine which one the creature obeys.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">주문
with Opposite Effects:</span><span> 주문 with opposite effects apply normally, with all
bonuses, penalties, or changes accruing in the order that they apply. Some
주문 negate or counter each other. This is a special effect that is noted in
a spell’s 묘사. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Instantaneous
Effects:</span><span>
Two or more 주문 with instantaneous 지속시간 work cumulatively when they
affect the same target.</span></p></section></section><section id="h2-10-spell-descriptions"><h2>주문 설명</h2><div class="original-headline">SPELL

group of related 주문 that work in similar ways. A small number of 주문 (<span style="font-style: italic;">비전의 징표, 제한된 소원, 영구화, 요술, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">소원</span>) are
universal, belonging to no 학파.</p><section id="h5-13-abjuration"><h5>회피술</h5><div class="original-headline">Abjuration</div><p>회피술
are protective 주문. They create physical or magical barriers, negate magical
or physical 능력, 해악 trespassers, or even banish the subject of the
spell to another plane of existence. </p><p>If
one 회피술 spell is active within 10 feet of another for 24 hours or more,
the magical fields interfere with each other and create barely visible energy
fluctuations. The DC to find such 주문 with the 탐색 skill drops by 4.</p><p>If
an 회피술 creates a barrier that keeps certain types of creatures at bay,
that barrier cannot be used to push away those creatures. If you force the
barrier against such a creature, you feel a discernible pressure against the
barrier. If you continue to apply pressure, you end the spell.</p></section><section id="h5-14-conjuration"><h5>소환술</h5><div class="original-headline">Conjuration</div><p>Each
소환술 spell belongs to one of five subschools. 소환술 bring
manifestations of objects, creatures, or some form of energy to you (the
summoning subschool), actually 운송수단 creatures from another plane of
existence to your plane (calling), 치료 (치료), 운송수단 creatures or
objects over great distances (teleportation), or 물체 생성 or effects on
the 감지 (creation). Creatures you conjure usually, but not always, obey your
명령.</p><p>A
creature or object brought into being or transported to your location by a
소환술 spell cannot appear inside another creature or object, nor can it
appear floating in an empty space. It must arrive in an open location on a
surface capable of supporting it.</p><p>The
creature or object must appear within the spell’s 거리, but it does not have
to remain within the 거리.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Calling:</span><span> A calling spell
운송수단 a creature from another plane to the plane you are on. The spell
grants the creature the one-time ability to return to its plane of origin,
although the spell may limit the circumstances under which this is possible.
Creatures who are called actually die when they are killed; they do not
disappear and reform, as do those brought by a summoning spell (see below). The
지속시간 of a calling spell is instantaneous, which means that the called
creature can’t be dispelled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Creation:
</span><span>A
creation spell manipulates matter to create an object or creature in the place
the spellcaster designates (subject to the limits noted above). If the spell
has a 지속시간 other than instantaneous, magic holds the creation together, and
when the spell ends, the conjured creature or object vanishes without a trace.
If the spell has an instantaneous 지속시간, the created object or creature is
merely assembled through magic. It lasts indefinitely and does not depend on
magic for its existence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">치료:
</span><span>Certain
신성 소환술 치료 creatures or even bring them back to life.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Summoning:</span><span> A summoning spell
instantly brings a creature or object to a place you designate. When the spell
ends or is dispelled, a summoned creature is instantly sent back to where it
came from, but a summoned object is not sent back unless the spell 묘사
specifically indicates this. A summoned creature also goes away if it is killed
or if its 히트 포인트 drop to 0 or lower. It is not really 죽음. It takes 24
hours for the creature to reform, during which time it can’t be summoned again.</span></p><p>When
the spell that summoned a creature ends and the creature disappears, all the
주문 it has cast expire. A summoned creature cannot use any innate summoning
능력 it may have, and it refuses to cast any 주문 that would cost it XP,
or to use any spell-like 능력 that would cost XP if they were 주문.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Teleportation:</span><span> A teleportation spell
운송수단 one or more creatures or objects a great distance. The most powerful
of these 주문 can cross planar boundaries. Unlike summoning 주문, the
transportation is (unless otherwise noted) one-way and not dispellable.</span></p><p>Teleportation
is instantaneous travel through 영적 세계. Anything that blocks astral
travel also blocks teleportation.</p></section><section id="h5-15-divination"><h5>점술</h5><div class="original-headline">Divination</div><p>점술
주문 enable you to learn secrets long forgotten, to predict the future, to
find hidden things, and to foil deceptive 주문.</p><p>Many
점술 주문 have cone-shaped 범위. These 이동 with you and extend in the
direction you look. The cone defines the 범위 that you can sweep each round. If
you study the same 범위 for multiple rounds, you can often gain additional
information, as noted in the 설명 문구 for the spell.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">염탐:</span><span> A 염탐 spell creates
an invisible magical sensor that sends you information. Unless noted otherwise,
the sensor has the same powers of sensory acuity that you possess. This 레벨
of acuity includes any 주문 or effects that target you, but not 주문 or
effects that emanate from you. However, the sensor is treated as a separate,
independent sensory organ of yours, and thus it functions normally even if you
have been blinded, deafened, or otherwise suffered sensory impairment.</span></p><p>Any
creature with an 지능 score of 12 or higher can notice the sensor by
making a DC 20 지능 check. The sensor can be dispelled as if it were an
active spell.</p><p>Lead
sheeting or magical protection blocks a 염탐 spell, and you sense that the
spell is so blocked.</p></section><section id="h5-16-enchantment"><h5>부여술</h5><div class="original-headline">Enchantment</div><p>부여술
주문 affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior.</p><p>All
부여술 are mind-affecting 주문. Two types of 부여술 주문 grant
you influence over a subject creature.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Charm:</span><span> A charm spell changes how
the subject views you, typically making it see you as a good friend.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Compulsion:</span><span> A compulsion spell forces
the subject to act in some manner or changes the way her mind works. Some
compulsion 주문 determine the subject’s actions or the effects on the
subject, some compulsion 주문 allow you to determine the subject’s actions when
you cast the spell, and others give you ongoing control over the subject.</span></p></section><section id="h5-17-evocation"><h5>강신술</h5><div class="original-headline">Evocation</div><p>강신술
주문 manipulate energy or tap an unseen source of power to produce a desired
end. In effect, they create something out of nothing. Many of these 주문
produce spectacular effects, and 강신술 주문 can deal large amounts of
피해.</p></section><section id="h5-18-illusion"><h5>환영술</h5><div class="original-headline">Illusion</div><p>환영술
주문 deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things
that are not there, not see things that are there, hear phantom noises, or
remember things that never happened.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Figment:</span><span> A figment spell creates a
false sensation. Those who perceive the figment perceive the same thing, not
their own slightly different versions of the figment. (It is not a personalized
mental impression.) Figments cannot make something seem to be something else. A
figment that includes audible effects cannot duplicate intelligible speech
unless the spell 묘사 specifically says it can. If intelligible speech
is possible, it must be in a language you can 말하기. If you try to duplicate a
language you cannot 말하기, the image produces gibberish. Likewise, you cannot
make a visual copy of something unless you know what it looks like.</span></p><p>Because
figments and glamers (see below) are unreal, they cannot produce real effects
the way that other types of 환영술 can. They cannot cause 피해 to objects
or creatures, support weight, provide nutrition, or provide protection from the
elements. Consequently, these 주문 are useful for confounding or delaying
foes, but useless for attacking them directly. </p><p>A
figment’s AC is equal to 10 + its size modifier.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Glamer:</span><span> A glamer spell changes a
subject’s sensory qualities, making it look, feel, taste, smell, or sound like
something else, or even seem to disappear.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Pattern:</span><span> Like a figment, a pattern
spell creates an image that others can see, but a pattern also affects the
minds of those who see it or are caught in it. All patterns are mind-affecting
주문.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Phantasm:
</span><span>A
phantasm spell creates a mental image that usually only the caster and the
subject (or subjects) of the spell can perceive. This impression is totally in
the minds of the subjects. It is a personalized mental impression. (It’s all in
their heads and not a fake picture or something that they actually see.) Third
parties viewing or studying the scene don’t notice the phantasm. All phantasms
are mind-affecting 주문.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">어둠:</span><span> A 어둠 spell creates
something that is partially real from extradimensional energy. Such 환영술
can have real effects. 피해 dealt by a 어둠 환영술 is real.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">내성 굴림 and 환영술 (Disbelief ): </span><span>Creatures encountering an 환영술
usually do not receive 내성 굴림 to recognize it as illusory until they
study it carefully or interact with it in some fashion.</span></p><p>A
successful 내성 굴림 against an 환영술 reveals it to be false, but a
figment or phantasm remains as a translucent outline.</p><p>A
failed 내성 굴림 indicates that a character fails to notice something is
amiss. A character faced with proof that an 환영술 isn’t real needs no 내성 굴림. If any viewer successfully disbelieves an 환영술 and communicates this
fact to others, each such viewer gains a 내성 굴림 with a +4 bonus.</p></section><section id="h5-19-necromancy"><h5>강령술</h5><div class="original-headline">Necromancy</div><p>강령술

on the same line as the 학파 and subschool, when applicable, is a descriptor

evil, 공포, fire, force, good, language-dependent, lawful, 빛,
mind-affecting, sonic, and water.</p><p>Most
of these descriptors have no game effect by themselves, but they govern how the
spell interacts with other 주문, with 특수 능력, with unusual
creatures, with 성향, and so on.</p><p>A
language-dependent spell uses intelligible language as a medium for
communication. If the target cannot understand or cannot hear what the caster

1 or higher.</p></section><section id="h3-22-level"><h3>레벨</h3><div class="original-headline">LEVEL</div><p>The
next line of a spell 묘사 gives the spell’s 레벨, a number between 0
and 9 that defines the spell’s relative power. This number is preceded by an
abbreviation for the class whose members can cast the spell. The 레벨 entry
also indicates whether a spell is a domain spell and, if so, what its domain
and its 레벨 as a domain spell are. A spell’s 레벨 affects the DC for any
save allowed against the effect.</p><p>이름
of spellcasting classes are abbreviated as follows: 음유시인 Brd; 사제 Clr; 드루이드
Drd; 성기사 Pal; 레인저 Rgr; 소서러 Sor; 마법사 Wiz.</p><p>The

파괴, Earth, Evil, Fire, Good, 치료, 지식, Law, Luck, Magic,
Plant, Protection, 근력, Sun, Travel, Trickery, War, and Water.</p></section><section id="h3-23-components"><h3>구성요소</h3><div class="original-headline">COMPONENTS</div><p>A
spell’s 구성요소 are what you must do or possess to cast it. The 구성요소
entry in a spell 묘사 includes abbreviations that tell you what type of
구성요소 it has. Specifics for material, focus, and XP 구성요소 are given
at the end of the 설명 문구. Usually you don’t worry about 구성요소,
but when you can’t use a component for some reason or when a material or focus
component is expensive, then the 구성요소 are important.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Verbal
(V):</span><span> A
verbal component is a spoken incantation. To provide a verbal component, you
must be able to 말하기 in a strong voice. A <span style="font-style: italic;">침묵 </span>spell or a gag spoils
the incantation (and thus the spell). A spellcaster who has been deafened has a
20% chance to spoil any spell with a verbal component that he or she tries to
cast.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Somatic
(S):</span><span> A
somatic component is a measured and precise 이동 of the hand. You must have
at least one hand free to provide a somatic component.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Material
(M):</span><span> A
material component is one or more physical substances or objects that are
annihilated by the spell energies in the casting process. Unless a cost is
given for a material component, the cost is negligible. Don’t bother to keep
추적 of material 구성요소 with negligible cost. Assume you have all you need
as long as you have your spell component pouch.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Focus
(F): </span><span>A
focus component is a prop of some sort. Unlike a material component, a focus is
not consumed when the spell is cast and can be reused. As with material
구성요소, the cost for a focus is negligible unless a price is given. Assume
that focus 구성요소 of negligible cost are in your spell component pouch.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">신성
Focus (DF):</span><span>
A 신성 focus component is an item of spiritual significance. The 신성 focus
for a 사제 or a 성기사 is a holy symbol appropriate to the character’s
faith. </span></p><p>If
the 구성요소 line includes F/DF or M/DF, the arcane version of the spell has
a focus component or a material component (the abbreviation before the slash)
and the 신성 version has a 신성 focus component (the abbreviation after the
slash).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">XP
Cost (XP):</span><span>
Some powerful 주문 entail an 경험치 비용 to you. No spell can
restore the XP lost in this manner. You cannot spend so much XP that you lose a
레벨, so you cannot cast the spell unless you have enough XP to spare.
However, you may, on gaining enough XP to attain a new 레벨, use those XP for
casting a spell rather than keeping them and advancing a 레벨. The XP are
treated just like a material component—expended when you cast the spell,
whether or not the casting succeeds.</span></p></section><section id="h3-24-casting-time"><h3>시전 시간</h3><div class="original-headline">CASTING TIME</div><p>Most
주문 have a 시전 시간 of 1 standard action. Others take 1 round or more,
while a few require only a free action.</p><p>A
spell that takes 1 round to cast is a full-round action. It comes into effect
just before the beginning of your turn in the round after you began casting the
spell. You then act normally after the spell is completed.</p><p>A
spell that takes 1 minute to cast comes into effect just before your turn 1
minute later (and for each of those 10 rounds, you are casting a spell as a
full-round action, just as noted above for 1- round 시전 시간). These
actions must be consecutive and uninterrupted, or the spell automatically
fails.</p><p>When
you begin a spell that takes 1 round or longer to cast, you must continue the
집중 from the current round to just before your turn in the next round
(at least). If you lose 집중 before the casting is complete, you lose
the spell.</p><p>A
spell with a 시전 시간 of 1 free action doesn’t count against your normal
limit of one spell per round. However, you may cast such a spell only once per
round. Casting a spell with a 시전 시간 of 1 free action doesn’t provoke
기회 공격.</p><p>You
make all pertinent decisions about a spell (거리, target, 범위, effect, version,
and so forth) when the spell comes into effect.</p></section><section id="h3-25-range"><h3>거리</h3><div class="original-headline">RANGE</div><p>A
spell’s 거리 indicates how far from you it can reach, as defined in the 거리
entry of the spell 묘사. A spell’s 거리 is the maximum distance from
you that the spell’s effect can occur, as well as the maximum distance at which
you can designate the spell’s point of origin. If any portion of the spell’s
범위 would extend beyond this 거리, that 범위 is wasted. Standard 거리
include the following.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Personal:</span><span> The spell affects only
you.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Touch:</span><span> You must touch a creature
or object to affect it. A touch spell that deals 피해 can score a critical
hit just as a weapon can. A touch spell threatens a critical hit on a natural
roll of 20 and deals double 피해 on a successful critical hit. Some touch
주문 allow you to touch multiple targets. You can touch as many willing
targets as you can reach as part of the casting, but all targets of the spell
must be touched in the same round that you finish casting the spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Close:</span><span> The spell reaches as far
as 25 feet away from you. The maximum 거리 increases by 5 feet for every two
full 시전자 레벨.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Medium:</span><span> The spell reaches as far
as 100 feet + 10 feet per 시전자 레벨.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Long:</span><span> The spell reaches as far
as 400 feet + 40 feet per 시전자 레벨.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Unlimited:</span><span> The spell reaches
anywhere on the same plane of existence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">거리
Expressed in Feet:</span><span> Some 주문 have no standard 거리 category, just a 거리
expressed in feet.</span></p></section><section id="h3-26-aiming-a-spell"><h3>주문 조준하기</h3><div class="original-headline">AIMING A SPELL</div><p>You must make
some choice about whom the spell is to affect or where the effect is to
originate, depending on the type of spell. The next entry in a spell
묘사 defines the spell’s target (or targets), its effect, or its 범위,
as appropriate.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Target
or 목표물:</span><span>
Some spellshave a target or targets. You cast these 주문 on creatures
or objects, as defined by the spell itself. You must be able to see or touch
the target, and you must specifically choose that target. You do not have to
select your target until you finish casting the spell.</span></p><p>If
the target of a spell is yourself (the spell 묘사 has a line that reads
Target: You), you do not receive a 내성 굴림, and 주문 저항 does not
apply. The 내성 굴림 and 주문 저항 lines are omitted from such
주문.</p><p>Some
주문 restrict you to willing targets only. Declaring yourself as a willing
target is something that can be done at any time (even if you’re flat-footed or
it isn’t your turn). Unconscious creatures are automatically considered
willing, but a character who is conscious but immobile or helpless (such as one
who is bound, cowering, grappling, paralyzed, pinned, or stunned) is not
automatically willing.</p><p>Some
주문 allow you to redirect the effect to new targets or 범위 after you cast
the spell. Redirecting a spell is a 이동 action that does not provoke 기회 공격.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">효과:</span><span> Some 주문 create or
summon things rather than affecting things that are already present.</span></p><p>You
must designate the location where these things are to appear, either by seeing
it or defining it. 거리 determines how far away an effect can appear, but if
the effect is mobile it can 이동 regardless of the spell’s 거리.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ray:
</span><span>Some
effects are 광선. You aim a ray as if using a ranged weapon, though typically
you make a ranged touch 공격 rather than a normal ranged 공격. As with a
ranged weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an invisible creature and hope
you hit something. You don’t have to see the creature you’re trying to hit, as
you do with a targeted spell. Intervening creatures and obstacles, however, can
block your line of sight or provide 엄폐 for the creature you’re aiming at.</span></p><p>If
a ray spell has a 지속시간, it’s the 지속시간 of the effect that the ray
causes, not the length of time the ray itself persists.</p><p>If
a ray spell deals 피해, you can score a critical hit just as if it were a
weapon. A ray spell threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals
double 피해 on a successful critical hit.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Spread:
</span><span>Some
effects, notably clouds and 안개, spread out from a point of origin, which must
be a grid intersection. The effect can extend around corners and into 범위
that you can’t see. Figure distance by actual distance traveled, taking into
account turns the spell effect takes. When determining distance for spread
effects, count around 벽, not through them. As with 이동, do not trace
diagonals across corners. You must designate the point of origin for such an
effect, but you need not have line of effect (see below) to all portions of the
effect.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">범위:</span><span> Some 주문 affect an
범위. Sometimes a spell 묘사 specifies a specially defined 범위, but
usually an 범위 falls into one of the categories defined below.</span></p><p>Regardless
of the shape of the 범위, you select the point where the spell originates, but
otherwise you don’t control which creatures or objects the spell affects. The
point of origin of a spell is always a grid intersection. When determining
whether a given creature is within the 범위 of a spell, count out the distance
from the point of origin in squares just as you do when moving a character or when
determining the 거리 for a ranged 공격. The only difference is that instead
of counting from the center of one square to the center of the next, you count
from intersection to intersection.</p><p>You
can count diagonally across a square, but remember that every second diagonal
counts as 2 squares of distance. If the far edge of a square is within the
spell’s 범위, anything within that square is within the spell’s 범위. If the
spell’s 범위 only touches the near edge of a square, however, anything within that
square is unaffected by the spell.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">폭발,
Emanation, or Spread: </span><span>Most 주문 that affect an 범위 function as a 폭발, an
emanation, or a spread. In each case, you select the spell’s point of origin
and measure its effect from that point.</span></p><p>A
폭발 spell affects whatever it catches in its 범위, even including creatures
that you can’t see. It can’t affect creatures with total 엄폐 from its point
of origin (in other words, its effects don’t extend around corners). The
default shape for a 폭발 effect is a sphere, but some 폭발 주문 are
specifically described as cone-shaped. A 폭발’s 범위 defines how far from the
point of origin the spell’s effect extends.</p><p>An
emanation spell functions like a 폭발 spell, except that the effect continues
to radiate from the point of origin for the 지속시간 of the spell. Most
emanations are cones or spheres.</p><p>A
spread spell spreads out like a 폭발 but can turn corners. You select the
point of origin, and the spell spreads out a given distance in all directions.
Figure the 범위 the spell effect fills by taking into account any turns the
spell effect takes.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Cone,
Cylinder, Line, or Sphere: </span><span>Most 주문 that affect an 범위 have a particular shape, such
as a cone, cylinder, line, or sphere.</span></p><p>A
cone-shaped spell shoots away from you in a quarter-circle in the direction you
designate. It starts from any corner of your square and widens out as it goes.
Most cones are either 폭발 or emanations (see above), and thus won’t go
around corners.</p><p>When
casting a cylinder-shaped spell, you select the spell’s point of origin. This
point is the center of a horizontal circle, and the spell shoots down from the
circle, filling a cylinder. A cylinder-shaped spell ignores any obstructions
within its 범위.</p><p>A
line-shaped spell shoots away from you in a line in the direction you
designate. It starts from any corner of your square and extends to the limit of
its 거리 or until it strikes a barrier that blocks line of effect. A
line-shaped spell affects all creatures in squares that the line passes through.</p><p>A
sphere-shaped spell expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical 범위.
Spheres may be 폭발, emanations, or spreads.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Creatures:
</span><span>A spell
with this kind of 범위 affects creatures directly (like a targeted spell), but
it affects all creatures in an 범위 of some kind rather than individual
creatures you select. The 범위 might be a spherical 폭발 , a cone-shaped
폭발, or some other shape.</span></p><p>Many
주문 affect “living creatures,” which means all creatures other than
constructs and undead. Creatures in the spell’s 범위 that are not of the
appropriate type do not count against the creatures affected.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Objects:
</span><span>A spell
with this kind of 범위 affects objects within an 범위 you select (as Creatures,
but affecting objects instead).</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Other:
</span><span>A spell
can have a unique 범위, as defined in its 묘사.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">(S)
Shapeable: </span><span>If
an 범위 or Effect entry ends with “(S),” you can shape the spell. A shaped
effect or 범위 can have no dimension smaller than 10 feet. Many effects or
범위 are given as cubes to make it easy to model irregular shapes.
Three-dimensional volumes are most often needed to define aerial or underwater
effects and 범위.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Line
of 효과:</span><span>
A line of effect is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what a spell can
affect. A line of effect is canceled by a solid barrier. It’s like line of
sight for ranged 무기, except that it’s not blocked by 안개, 암흑, and
other factors that limit normal sight.</span></p><p>You
must have a clear line of effect to any target that you 주문 시전 on or to
any space in which you 소원 to create an effect. You must have a clear line of
effect to the point of origin of any spell you cast<span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p>A
폭발, cone, cylinder, or emanation spell affects only an 범위, creatures, or
objects to which it has line of effect from its origin (a spherical 폭발’s
center point, a cone-shaped 폭발’s starting point, a cylinder’s circle, or an
emanation’s point of origin).</p><p>An
otherwise solid barrier with a hole of at least 1 square foot through it does
not block a spell’s line of effect. Such an opening means that the 5-foot length
of wall containing the hole is no longer considered a barrier for 목적 of a
spell’s line of effect.</p></section><section id="h3-27-duration"><h3>지속시간</h3><div class="original-headline">DURATION</div><p>A
spell’s 지속시간 entry tells you how long the magical energy of the spell
lasts.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Timed
지속시간: </span><span>Many
지속시간 are measured in rounds, minutes, hours, or some other increment. When
the time is up, the magic goes away and the spell ends. If a spell’s 지속시간
is variable the 지속시간 is rolled secretly (the caster doesn’t know how long
the spell will last). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Instantaneous:</span><span> The spell energy comes
and goes the instant the spell is cast, though the consequences might be
long-lasting.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Permanent:
</span><span>The
energy remains as long as the effect does. This means the spell is vulnerable
to <span style="font-style: italic;">마법 무효화</span>. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">집중:</span><span> The spell lasts as long
as you concentrate on it. Concentrating to maintain a spell is a standard
action that does not provoke 기회 공격. Anything that could break
your 집중 when casting a spell can also break your 집중 while
you’re maintaining one, causing the spell to end.</span></p><p>You
can’t 주문 시전 while concentrating on another one. Sometimes a spell lasts
for a short time after you cease concentrating.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Subjects,
Effects, and 범위:</span><span> If the spell affects creatures directly the result travels
with the subjects for the spell’s 지속시간. If the spell creates an effect, the
effect lasts for the 지속시간. The effect might 이동 or remain still. Such an
effect can be destroyed prior to when its 지속시간 ends. If the spell affects
an 범위 then the spell stays with that 범위 for its 지속시간. </span></p><p>Creatures
become subject to the spell when they enter the 범위 and are no longer subject
to it when they leave.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Touch
주문 and Holding the 돌격:</span><span> In most cases, if you don’t discharge a touch spell
on the round you cast it, you can hold the 돌격 (postpone the discharge of
the spell) indefinitely. You can make touch 공격 round after round. If you
cast another spell, the touch spell dissipates.</span></p><p>Some
touch spellsallow you to touch multiple targets as part of the spell.
You can’t hold the 돌격 of such a spell; you must touch all targets of the
spell in the same round that you finish casting the spell.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Discharge:</span><span> Occasionally a 주문
lasts for a set 지속시간 or until triggered or discharged.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">(D)
Dismissible:</span><span>
If the 지속시간 line ends with “(D),” you can dismiss the spell at will. You
must be within 거리 of the spell’s effect and must 말하기 words of 차원 강제퇴거,
which are usually a modified form of the spell’s verbal component. If the spell
has no verbal component, you can dismiss the effect with a gesture. Dismissing
a spell is a standard action that does not provoke 기회 공격.</span></p><p>A
spell that depends on 집중 is dismissible by its very nature, and
dismissing it does not take an action, since all you have to do to end the
spell is to stop concentrating on your turn.</p></section><section id="h3-28-saving-throw"><h3>내성 굴림</h3><div class="original-headline">SAVING THROW</div><p>Usually
a harmful spell allows a target to make a 내성 굴림 to avoid some or all of
the effect. The 내성 굴림 entry in a spell 묘사 defines which type of
내성 굴림 the spell allows and describes how 내성 굴림 against the spell
work.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Negates:
</span><span>The spell
has no effect on a subject that makes a successful 내성 굴림.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Partial:</span><span> The spell causes an
effect on its subject. A successful 내성 굴림 means that some 하급 effect
occurs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Half:</span><span> The spell deals 피해,
and a successful 내성 굴림 halves the 피해 taken (round down).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">None:</span><span> No 내성 굴림 is
allowed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Disbelief:</span><span> A successful save lets
the subject ignore the effect. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">(object):</span><span> The spell can be cast on
objects, which receive 내성 굴림 only if they are magical or if they are
attended (held, worn, grasped, or the like) by a creature resisting the spell,
in which case the object uses the creature’s 내성 굴림 bonus unless its own
bonus is 상급. (This notation does not mean that a spell can be cast only on
objects. Some 주문 of this sort can be cast on creatures or objects.) A magic
item’s 내성 굴림 bonuses are each equal to 2 + one-half the item’s 시전자 레벨. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">(harmless):</span><span> The spell is usually
beneficial, not harmful, but a targeted creature can attempt a 내성 굴림 if
it desires.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">내성 굴림 난이도 등급:</span><span> A 내성 굴림 against your spell has a DC of 10 + the 레벨
of the spell + your bonus for the relevant ability (지능 for a 마법사,
매력 for a 소서러 or 음유시인, or 지혜 for a 사제, 드루이드, 성기사, or
레인저). A spell’s 레벨 can vary depending on your class. Always use the spell
레벨 applicable to your class.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Succeeding
on a 내성 굴림: </span><span>A creature that successfully 내성 굴림 against a spell that has
no obvious physical effects feels a hostile force or a tingle, but cannot
deduce the exact nature of the 공격. Likewise, if a creature’s 내성 굴림
succeeds against a targeted spell you sense that the spell has failed. You do
not sense when creatures succeed on 내성 굴림 against effect and 범위 주문.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Automatic
Failures and Successes:</span><span> A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a 내성 굴림 is always
a failure, and the spell may cause 피해 to exposed items (see Items Surviving
after a 내성 굴림, below). A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a
success.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Voluntarily
Giving up a 내성 굴림:</span><span> A creature can voluntarily forego a 내성 굴림 and
willingly accept a spell’s result. Even a character with a special 저항
to magic can suppress this quality.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Items
Surviving after a 내성 굴림:</span><span> Unless the 설명 문구 for the spell specifies
otherwise, all items carried or worn by a creature are assumed to survive a
magical 공격. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its 내성 굴림 against the
effect, however, an exposed item is harmed (if the 공격 can 해악 objects).
Refer to Table: Items Affected by Magical 공격. Determine which four objects
carried or worn by the creature are most likely to be affected and roll
randomly among them. The randomly determined item must make a 내성 굴림
against the 공격 form and take whatever 피해 the 공격 deal.</span></p><p>If
an item is not carried or worn and is not magical, it does not get a 내성 굴림. It simply is dealt the appropriate 피해.</p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 28.1251em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="break-inside: avoid; vertical-align: middle;"><td colspan="2" style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Table: Items Affected by

SPELLS</div><p>A
마법사’s 레벨 limits the number of 주문 she can prepare and cast. Her high
지능 score might allow her to prepare a few extra 주문. She can
prepare the same spell more than once, but each preparation counts as one spell
toward her daily limit. To prepare a spell the 마법사 must have an 지능
score of at least 10 + the spell’s 레벨.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Rest:
</span><span>To
prepare her daily 주문, a 마법사 must first 수면 for 8 hours. The 마법사
does not have to slumber for every minute of the time, but she must refrain
from 이동, 전투, spellcasting, skill use, conversation, or any other
fairly demanding physical or mental task during the rest period. If her rest is
interrupted, each interruption adds 1 hour to the total amount of time she has
to rest in order to clear her mind, and she must have at least 1 hour of
uninterrupted rest immediately prior to preparing her 주문. If the character
does not need to 수면 for some reason, she still must have 8 hours of restful
calm before preparing any 주문. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Recent
Casting Limit/Rest Interruptions:</span><span> If a 마법사 has cast 주문 recently, the drain on her
resources reduces her capacity to prepare 새로운 주문. When she prepares 주문
for the coming day, all the 주문 she has cast within the last 8 hours count
against her daily limit.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Preparation
환경:</span><span>
To prepare any spell, a 마법사 must have enough peace, quiet, and comfort to
allow for proper 집중. The 마법사’s surroundings need not be
luxurious, but they must be free from overt distractions. Exposure to inclement
날씨 prevents the necessary 집중, as does any injury or failed
내성 굴림 the character might experience while studying. 마법사 also must
have access to their spellbooks to study from and sufficient 빛 to read them
by. There is one major exception: A 마법사 can prepare a <span style="font-style: italic;">마법 읽기 </span>spell
even without a spellbook. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell
Preparation Time:</span><span> After resting, a 마법사 must study her spellbook to prepare
any 주문 that day. If she wants to prepare all her 주문, the process takes
1 hour. Preparing some smaller portion of her daily capacity takes a
proportionally smaller amount of time, but always at least 15 minutes, the
minimum time required to achieve the proper mental state.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell
Selection and Preparation:</span><span> Until she prepares 주문 from her spellbook, the only
주문 a 마법사 has available to cast are the ones that she already had
prepared from the previous day and has not yet used. During the study period,
she chooses which 주문 to prepare. If a 마법사 already has 주문 prepared
(from the previous day) that she has not cast, she can abandon some or all of
them to make room for 새로운 주문.</span></p><p>When
preparing 주문 for the day, a 마법사 can leave some of these spell slots
open. Later during that day, she can repeat the preparation process as often as
she likes, time and circumstances permitting. During these extra sessions of
preparation, the 마법사 can fill these unused spell slots. She cannot, however,
abandon a previously prepared spell to replace it with another one or fill a
slot that is empty because she has 주문 시전 in the meantime. That sort of
preparation requires a mind fresh from rest. Like the first session of the day,
this preparation takes at least 15 minutes, and it takes longer if the 마법사
prepares more than one-quarter of her 주문.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell
Slots:</span><span>
The various character class tables show how many 주문 of each 레벨 a
character can cast per day. These openings for daily 주문 are called spell
slots. A spellcaster always has the option to fill a higher-레벨 spell slot
with a lower-레벨 spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high enough ability score
to cast 주문 that would otherwise be his or her due still gets the slots but
must fill them with 주문 of lower 레벨.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prepared
Spell Retention:</span><span>
Once a 마법사 prepares a spell, it remains in her mind as a nearly cast spell
until she uses the prescribed 구성요소 to complete and 신관 it or until
she abandons it. Certain other events, such as the effects of 마법 아이템 or
특수 공격 from 몬스터, can wipe a prepared spell from a character’s
mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Death
and Prepared Spell Retention:</span><span> If a spellcaster dies, all prepared 주문 stored in his or
her mind are wiped away. Potent magic (such as <span style="font-style: italic;">시체 되살리기, 부활, </span>or
<span style="font-style: italic;">진정한 부활</span>) can recover the lost energy when it recovers the
character.</span></p></section><section id="h3-33-arcane-magical-writings"><h3>비전 마법 작성</h3><div class="original-headline">ARCANE MAGICAL
WRITINGS</div><p>To
record an arcane spell in written form, a character uses complex notation that
describes the magical forces involved in the spell. The writer uses the same
system no matter what her native language or culture. However, each character uses
the system in her own way. Another person’s magical writing remains
incomprehensible to even the most powerful 마법사 until she takes time to study
and decipher it.</p><p>To
decipher an arcane magical writing (such as a single spell in written form in
another’s spellbook or on a scroll), a character must make a 주문학 check
(DC 20 + the spell’s 레벨). If the skill check fails, the character cannot
attempt to read that particular spell again until the next day. A <span style="font-style: italic;">마법 읽기
</span>spell automatically deciphers a magical writing without a skill check. If
the person who created the magical writing is on hand to help the reader,
success is also automatic.</p><p>Once
a character deciphers a particular magical writing, she does not need to
decipher it again. Deciphering a magical writing allows the reader to 식별
the spell and gives some idea of its effects (as explained in the spell
묘사). If the magical writing was a scroll and the reader can cast
비전 주문, she can attempt to use the scroll.</p><p>마법사
주문 and Borrowed Spellbooks</p><p>A
마법사 can use a borrowed spellbook to prepare a spell she already knows and
has recorded in her own spellbook, but preparation success is not assured.
First, the 마법사 must decipher the writing in the book (see 비전 마법 작성,
above). Once a spell from another spellcaster’s book is deciphered, the reader
must make a 주문학 check (DC 15 + spell’s 레벨) to prepare the spell. If
the check succeeds, the 마법사 can prepare the spell. She must repeat the check
to prepare the spell again, no matter how many times she has prepared it
before. If the check fails, she cannot try to prepare the spell from the same
source again until the next day. (However, as explained above, she does not
need to repeat a check to decipher the writing.)</p><p>Adding
주문 to a 마법사’s Spellbook</p><p>마법사
can add 새로운 주문 to their spellbooks through several methods. If a 마법사 has
chosen to specialize in a 학파 of magic, she can learn 주문 only from

magic, one of the two free 주문 must be from her specialty 학파.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">주문
Copied from Another’s Spellbook or a Scroll:</span><span> A 마법사 can also add a spell to her
book whenever she encounters one on a magic scroll or in another 마법사’s
spellbook. No matter what the spell’s source, the 마법사 must first decipher
the magical writing (see 비전 마법 작성, above). Next, she must spend
a day studying the spell. At the end of the day, she must make a 주문학
check (DC 15 + spell’s 레벨). A 마법사 who has specialized in a 학파 of
주문 gains a +2 bonus on the 주문학 check if the new spell is from her
specialty 학파. She cannot, however, learn any 주문 from her prohibited
학파. If the check succeeds, the 마법사 understands the spell and can copy
it into her spellbook (see Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook, below). The
process leaves a spellbook that was copied from unharmed, but a spell
successfully copied from a magic scroll disappears from the parchment.</span></p><p>If
the check fails, the 마법사 cannot understand or copy the spell. She cannot
attempt to learn or copy that spell again until she gains another rank in
주문학. A spell that was being copied from a scroll does not vanish from
the scroll.</p><p>In

the requirement for a relatively peaceful 환경. A 신성 spellcaster
does not have to prepare all his 주문 at once. However, the character’s mind
is considered fresh only during his or her first daily spell preparation, so a
신성 spellcaster cannot fill a slot that is empty because he or she has 주문 시전 or abandoned a previously prepared spell.</span></p><p>신성
spellcasters do not require spellbooks. However, such a character’s spell
selection is limited to the 주문 on the list for his or her class. 사제,
드루이드, 성기사, and 레인저 have separate spell lists. A 사제 also has
access to two domains determined during his character creation. Each domain
gives him access to a domain spell at each spell 레벨 from 1st to 9th, as well
as a special granted power. With access to two domain 주문 at each spell
레벨—one from each of his two domains—a 사제 must prepare, as an 추가 계열 spell, one or the other each day for each 레벨 of spell he can cast. If
a domain spell is not on the 사제 spell list, it can be prepared only in a
domain spell slot.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell
Slots:</span><span>
The character class tables show how many 주문 of each 레벨 a character can
cast per day.</span></p><p>These
openings for daily 주문 are called spell slots. A spellcaster always has the
option to fill a higher-레벨 spell slot with a lower 레벨 spell. A
spellcaster who lacks a high enough ability score to cast 주문 that would
otherwise be his or her due still gets the slots but must fill them with 주문
of lower 레벨. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Recent
Casting Limit:</span><span>
As with 비전 주문, at the time of preparation any 주문 cast within the
previous 8 hours count against the number of 주문 that can be prepared.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spontaneous

(or a 사제 of an evil deity) can spontaneously cast an <span style="font-style: italic;">inflict </span>spell

depending on which option the player chooses when creating the character. The

ABILITIES</div><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell-Like
능력:</span><span>
Usually, a spell-like ability works just like the spell of that 이름. A few
spell-like 능력 are unique; these are explained in the text where they are
described.</span></p><p>A
spell-like ability has no verbal, somatic, or material component, nor does it
require a focus or have an XP cost. The user activates it mentally. 갑옷 never
affects a spell-like ability’s use, even if the ability resembles an arcane
spell with a somatic component.</p><p>A
spell-like ability has a 시전 시간 of 1 standard action unless noted
otherwise in the ability or spell 묘사. In all other ways, a spell-like
ability functions just like a spell.</p><p>Spell-like
능력 are subject to 주문 저항 and to being dispelled by <span style="font-style: italic;">마법 무효화</span>. They do not function in 범위 where magic is suppressed or negated.
Spell-like 능력 cannot be used to counterspell, nor can they be
counterspelled.</p><p>Some
creatures are actually 소서러 of a sort. They cast 비전 주문 as
소서러 do, using 구성요소 when required. In fact, an individual creature
could have some spell-like 능력 and also cast other 주문 as a 소서러.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Supernatural
능력:</span><span>
These 능력 cannot be disrupted in 전투, as 주문 can, and they
generally do not provoke 기회 공격. Supernatural 능력 are not
subject to 주문 저항, 주문 무효화, or to being dispelled by <span style="font-style: italic;">마법 무효화</span>, and do not function in 범위 where magic is suppressed or negated.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Extraordinary
능력:</span><span>
These 능력 cannot be disrupted in 전투, as 주문 can, and they
generally do not provoke 기회 공격. Effects or 범위 that negate
or disrupt magic have no effect on extraordinary 능력. They are not
subject to dispelling, and they function normally in an <span style="font-style: italic;">대마법 보호장. </span>Indeed,
extraordinary 능력 do not qualify as magical, though they may break the
laws of physics.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Natural
능력:</span><span>
This category includes 능력 a creature has because of its physical nature.
Natural 능력 are those not otherwise designated as extraordinary,
supernatural, or spell-like.</span></p></section></section></div></main></div><nav class="Layout_sidebar__2Jy-3"><div><div class="SearchForm_searchBox__9EPie Layout_searchForm__1dpCr"><input
