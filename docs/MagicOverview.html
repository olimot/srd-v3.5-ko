class="Layout_main__3m1yK"><div><p>This material is Open
Game Content, and is licensed for public use under the terms of the Open Game
License v1.0a.</p><section id="h1-0-magic-overview"><h1>마법 개요</h1><p>A
spell is a one-time magical effect. Spells come in two types: arcane (cast by
bards, sorcerers, and wizards) and divine (cast by clerics, druids, and
experienced paladins and rangers). Some spellcasters select their spells from a
limited list of spells known, while others have access to a wide variety of
options.</p><p>Most
spellcasters prepare their spells in advance—whether from a spellbook or
through devout prayers and meditation— while some cast spells spontaneously
without preparation.</p><p>Despite
these different ways that characters use to learn or prepare their spells, when
it comes to casting them, the spells are very much alike.</p><p>Cutting across
the categories of arcane and divine spells are the eight schools of magic.
These schools represent the different ways that spells take effect.</p><section id="h2-1-casting-spells"><h2>주문 시전하기</h2><p>Whether
a spell is arcane or divine, and whether a character prepares spells in advance
or chooses them on the spot, casting a spell works the same way.</p><section id="h3-2-choosing-a-spell"><h3>주문 선택하기</h3><p>First
you must choose which spell to cast. If you’re a cleric, druid, experienced
paladin, experienced ranger, or wizard, you select from among spells prepared
earlier in the day and not yet cast (see Preparing Wizard Spells and Preparing
Divine Spells).</p><p>If
you’re a bard or sorcerer, you can select any spell you know, provided you are
capable of casting spells of that level or higher.</p><p>To
cast a spell, you must be able to speak (if the spell has a verbal component),
gesture (if it has a somatic component), and manipulate the material components
or focus (if any). Additionally, you must concentrate to cast a spell.</p><p>If
a spell has multiple versions, you choose which version to use when you cast
it. You don’t have to prepare (or learn, in the case of a bard or sorcerer) a
specific version of the spell.</p><p>Once
you’ve cast a prepared spell, you can’t cast it again until you prepare it
again. (If you’ve prepared multiple copies of a single spell, you can cast each
copy once.) If you’re a bard or sorcerer, casting a spell counts against your
daily limit for spells of that spell level, but you can cast the same spell
again if you haven’t reached your limit.</p></section><section id="h3-3-concentration"><h3>집중</h3><p>To
cast a spell, you must concentrate. If something interrupts your concentration
while you’re casting, you must make a Concentration check or lose the spell.
The more distracting the interruption and the higher the level of the spell you
are trying to cast, the higher the DC is. If you fail the check, you lose the
spell just as if you had cast it to no effect.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Injury:</span><span> If while trying to cast a
spell you take damage, you must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + points of
damage taken + the level of the spell you’re casting). If you fail the check,
you lose the spell without effect. The interrupting event strikes during
spellcasting if it comes between when you start and when you complete a spell
(for a spell with a casting time of 1 full round or more) or if it comes in
response to your casting the spell (such as an attack of opportunity provoked
by the spell or a contingent attack, such as a readied action).</span></p><p>If
you are taking continuous damage half the damage is considered to take place
while you are casting a spell. You must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2
the damage that the continuous source last dealt + the level of the spell
you’re casting). If the last damage dealt was the last damage that the effect
could deal then the damage is over, and it does not distract you.</p><p>Repeated
damage does not count as continuous damage.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell:
</span><span>If you
are affected by a spell while attempting to cast a spell of your own, you must
make a Concentration check or lose the spell you are casting. If the spell
affecting you deals damage, the DC is 10 + points of damage + the level of the
spell you’re casting.</span></p><p>If
the spell interferes with you or distracts you in some other way, the DC is the
spell’s saving throw DC + the level of the spell you’re casting. For a spell
with no saving throw, it’s the DC that the spell’s saving throw would have if a
save were allowed.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Grappling
or Pinned:</span><span>
The only spells you can cast while grappling or pinned are those without
somatic components and whose material components (if any) you have in hand.
Even so, you must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + the level of the spell
you’re casting) or lose the spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Vigorous
Motion:</span><span>
If you are riding on a moving mount, taking a bouncy ride in a wagon, on a
small boat in rough water, below-decks in a storm-tossed ship, or simply being
jostled in a similar fashion, you must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + the
level of the spell you’re casting) or lose the spell. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Violent
Motion: </span><span>If
you are on a galloping horse, taking a very rough ride in a wagon, on a small
boat in rapids or in a storm, on deck in a storm-tossed ship, or being tossed
roughly about in a similar fashion, you must make a Concentration check (DC 15
+ the level of the spell you’re casting) or lose the spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Violent
Weather: </span><span>You
must make a Concentration check if you try to cast a spell in violent weather.
If you are in a high wind carrying blinding rain or sleet, the DC is 5 + the
level of the spell you’re casting. If you are in wind-driven hail, dust, or
debris, the DC is 10 + the level of the spell you’re casting. In either case,
you lose the spell if you fail the Concentration check. If the weather is
caused by a spell, use the rules in the Spell subsection above.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Casting
Defensively:</span><span>
If you want to cast a spell without provoking any attacks of opportunity, you
must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell you’re casting)
to succeed. You lose the spell if you fail.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Entangled:</span><span> If you want to cast a spell
while entangled in a net or by a tanglefoot bag or while you’re affected by a
spell with similar effects, you must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast
the spell. You lose the spell if you fail.</span></p></section><section id="h3-4-counterspells"><h3>주문 무효화</h3><p>It
is possible to cast any spell as a counterspell. By doing so, you are using the
spell’s energy to disrupt the casting of the same spell by another character.
Counterspelling works even if one spell is divine and the other arcane.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">How
Counterspells Work: </span><span>To use a counterspell, you must select an opponent as the
target of the counterspell. You do this by choosing the ready action. In doing
so, you elect to wait to complete your action until your opponent tries to cast
a spell. (You may still move your speed, since ready is a standard action.)</span></p><p>If
the target of your counterspell tries to cast a spell, make a Spellcraft check
(DC 15 + the spell’s level). This check is a free action. If the check
succeeds, you correctly identify the opponent’s spell and can attempt to
counter it. If the check fails, you can’t do either of these things.</p><p>To
complete the action, you must then cast the correct spell. As a general rule, a
spell can only counter itself. If you are able to cast the same spell and you
have it prepared (if you prepare spells), you cast it, altering it slightly to
create a counterspell effect. If the target is within range, both spells
automatically negate each other with no other results.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Counterspelling
Metamagic Spells:</span><span> Metamagic feats are not taken into account when determining
whether a spell can be countered</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Specific
Exceptions:</span><span>
Some spells specifically counter each other, especially when they have
diametrically opposed effects.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 700;">Dispel
Magic </span><span style="font-weight: 700;">as
a Counterspell:</span><span>
You can use <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel magic </span>to counterspell another spellcaster, and you
don’t need to identify the spell he or she is casting. However, <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel magic
</span>doesn’t always work as a counterspell (see the spell description).</span></p></section><section id="h3-5-caster-level"><h3>시전자 레벨</h3><p>A
spell’s power often depends on its caster level, which for most spellcasting
characters is equal to your class level in the class you’re using to cast the
spell. </p><p>You
can cast a spell at a lower caster level than normal, but the caster level you
choose must be high enough for you to cast the spell in question, and all
level-dependent features must be based on the same caster level. </p><p>In
the event that a class feature, domain granted power, or other special ability
provides an adjustment to your caster level, that adjustment applies not only
to effects based on caster level (such as range, duration, and damage dealt)
but also to your caster level check to overcome your target’s spell resistance
and to the caster level used in dispel checks (both the dispel check and the DC
of the check). </p></section><section id="h3-6-spell-failure"><h3>주문 실패</h3><p>If
you ever try to cast a spell in conditions where the characteristics of the
spell cannot be made to conform, the casting fails and the spell is wasted.</p><p>Spells
also fail if your concentration is broken and might fail if you’re wearing
armor while casting a spell with somatic components.</p></section><section id="h3-7-the-spell-s-result"><h3>주문의 결과</h3><p>Once
you know which creatures (or objects or areas) are affected, and whether those
creatures have made successful saving throws (if any were allowed), you can
apply whatever results a spell entails.</p></section><section id="h3-8-special-spell-effects"><h3>특수 주문 효과</h3><p>Many
special spell effects are handled according to the school of the spells in
question Certain other special spell features are found across spell schools.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Attacks:</span><span> Some spell descriptions
refer to attacking. All offensive combat actions, even those that don’t damage
opponents are considered attacks. Attempts to turn or rebuke undead count as
attacks. All spells that opponents resist with saving throws, that deal damage,
or that otherwise harm or hamper subjects are attacks. Spells that summon
monsters or other allies are not attacks because the spells themselves don’t
harm anyone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Bonus
Types:</span><span>
Usually, a bonus has a type that indicates how the spell grants the bonus. The
important aspect of bonus types is that two bonuses of the same type don’t
generally stack. With the exception of dodge bonuses, most circumstance
bonuses, and racial bonuses, only the better bonus works (see Combining Magical
Effects, below). The same principle applies to penalties—a character taking two
or more penalties of the same type applies only the worst one.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Bringing
Back the Dead:</span><span>
Several spells have the power to restore slain characters to life.</span></p><p>When
a living creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves the Material Plane,
travels through the Astral Plane, and goes to abide on the plane where the
creature’s deity resides. If the creature did not worship a deity, its soul
departs to the plane corresponding to its alignment. Bringing someone back from
the dead means retrieving his or her soul and returning it to his or her body.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Level
Loss: </span><span>Any
creature brought back to life usually loses one level of experience. The character’s
new XP total is midway between the minimum needed for his or her new (reduced)
level and the minimum needed for the next one. If the character was 1st level
at the time of death, he or she loses 2 points of Constitution instead of
losing a level.</span></p><p>This
level loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any mortal means, even <span style="font-style: italic;">wish
</span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">miracle. </span>A revived character can regain a lost level by earning
XP through further adventuring. A revived character who was 1st level at the
time of death can regain lost points of Constitution by improving his or her
Constitution score when he or she attains a level that allows an ability score
increase.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Preventing
Revivification: </span><span>Enemies
can take steps to make it more difficult for a character to be returned from
the dead. Keeping the body prevents others from using <span style="font-style: italic;">raise dead </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">resurrection
</span>to restore the slain character to life. Casting <span style="font-style: italic;">trap the soul </span>prevents
any sort of revivification unless the soul is first released.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Revivification
against One’s Will: </span><span>A soul cannot be returned to life if it does not wish to be.
A soul knows the name, alignment, and patron deity (if any) of the character
attempting to revive it and may refuse to return on that basis.</span></p></section><section id="h3-9-combining-magical-effects"><h3>주문 효과 조합하기</h3><p>Spells
or magical effects usually work as described, no matter how many other spells
or magical effects happen to be operating in the same area or on the same
recipient. Except in special cases, a spell does not affect the way another
spell operates. Whenever a spell has a specific effect on other spells, the
spell description explains that effect. Several other general rules apply when
spells or magical effects operate in the same place:</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Stacking
Effects:</span><span> Spells
that provide bonuses or penalties on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws,
and other attributes usually do not stack with themselves. More generally, two
bonuses of the same type don’t stack even if they come from different spells
(or from effects other than spells; see Bonus Types, above). </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Different
Bonus Names: </span><span>The
bonuses or penalties from two different spells stack if the modifiers are of
different types. A bonus that isn’t named stacks with any bonus.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Same
Effect More than Once in Different Strengths: </span><span>In cases when two or more identical
spells are operating in the same area or on the same target, but at different
strengths, only the best one applies.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Same
Effect with Differing Results: </span><span>The same spell can sometimes produce varying effects
if applied to the same recipient more than once. Usually the last spell in the
series trumps the others. None of the previous spells are actually removed or
dispelled, but their effects become irrelevant while the final spell in the
series lasts.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">One
Effect Makes Another Irrelevant: </span><span>Sometimes, one spell can render a later spell
irrelevant. Both spells are still active, but one has rendered the other
useless in some fashion.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Multiple
Mental Control Effects: </span><span>Sometimes magical effects that establish mental control
render each other irrelevant, such as a spell that removes the subjects ability
to act. Mental controls that don’t remove the recipient’s ability to act
usually do not interfere with each other. If a creature is under the mental
control of two or more creatures, it tends to obey each to the best of its
ability, and to the extent of the control each effect allows. If the controlled
creature receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the competing controllers
must make opposed Charisma checks to determine which one the creature obeys.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spells
with Opposite Effects:</span><span> Spells with opposite effects apply normally, with all
bonuses, penalties, or changes accruing in the order that they apply. Some
spells negate or counter each other. This is a special effect that is noted in
a spell’s description. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Instantaneous
Effects:</span><span>
Two or more spells with instantaneous durations work cumulatively when they
affect the same target.</span></p></section></section><section id="h2-10-spell-descriptions"><h2>주문 설명</h2><p>The
description of each spell is presented in a standard format. Each category of
information is explained and defined below.</p><section id="h3-11-name"><h3>이름</h3><p>The
first line of every spell description gives the name by which the spell is
generally known.</p></section><section id="h3-12-school-subschool"><h3>학파 (하위학파)</h3><p>Beneath
the spell name is a line giving the school of magic (and the subschool, if appropriate)
that the spell belongs to.</p><p>Almost
every spell belongs to one of eight schools of magic. A school of magic is a
group of related spells that work in similar ways. A small number of spells (<span style="font-style: italic;">arcane
mark, limited wish, permanency, prestidigitation, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">wish</span>) are
universal, belonging to no school.</p><section id="h5-13-abjuration"><h5>회피술</h5><p>Abjurations
are protective spells. They create physical or magical barriers, negate magical
or physical abilities, harm trespassers, or even banish the subject of the
spell to another plane of existence. </p><p>If
one abjuration spell is active within 10 feet of another for 24 hours or more,
the magical fields interfere with each other and create barely visible energy
fluctuations. The DC to find such spells with the Search skill drops by 4.</p><p>If
an abjuration creates a barrier that keeps certain types of creatures at bay,
that barrier cannot be used to push away those creatures. If you force the
barrier against such a creature, you feel a discernible pressure against the
barrier. If you continue to apply pressure, you end the spell.</p></section><section id="h5-14-conjuration"><h5>창조술</h5><p>Each
conjuration spell belongs to one of five subschools. Conjurations bring
manifestations of objects, creatures, or some form of energy to you (the
summoning subschool), actually transport creatures from another plane of
existence to your plane (calling), heal (healing), transport creatures or
objects over great distances (teleportation), or create objects or effects on
the spot (creation). Creatures you conjure usually, but not always, obey your
commands.</p><p>A
creature or object brought into being or transported to your location by a
conjuration spell cannot appear inside another creature or object, nor can it
appear floating in an empty space. It must arrive in an open location on a
surface capable of supporting it.</p><p>The
creature or object must appear within the spell’s range, but it does not have
to remain within the range.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Calling:</span><span> A calling spell
transports a creature from another plane to the plane you are on. The spell
grants the creature the one-time ability to return to its plane of origin,
although the spell may limit the circumstances under which this is possible.
Creatures who are called actually die when they are killed; they do not
disappear and reform, as do those brought by a summoning spell (see below). The
duration of a calling spell is instantaneous, which means that the called
creature can’t be dispelled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Creation:
</span><span>A
creation spell manipulates matter to create an object or creature in the place
the spellcaster designates (subject to the limits noted above). If the spell
has a duration other than instantaneous, magic holds the creation together, and
when the spell ends, the conjured creature or object vanishes without a trace.
If the spell has an instantaneous duration, the created object or creature is
merely assembled through magic. It lasts indefinitely and does not depend on
magic for its existence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Healing:
</span><span>Certain
divine conjurations heal creatures or even bring them back to life.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Summoning:</span><span> A summoning spell
instantly brings a creature or object to a place you designate. When the spell
ends or is dispelled, a summoned creature is instantly sent back to where it
came from, but a summoned object is not sent back unless the spell description
specifically indicates this. A summoned creature also goes away if it is killed
or if its hit points drop to 0 or lower. It is not really dead. It takes 24
hours for the creature to reform, during which time it can’t be summoned again.</span></p><p>When
the spell that summoned a creature ends and the creature disappears, all the
spells it has cast expire. A summoned creature cannot use any innate summoning
abilities it may have, and it refuses to cast any spells that would cost it XP,
or to use any spell-like abilities that would cost XP if they were spells.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Teleportation:</span><span> A teleportation spell
transports one or more creatures or objects a great distance. The most powerful
of these spells can cross planar boundaries. Unlike summoning spells, the
transportation is (unless otherwise noted) one-way and not dispellable.</span></p><p>Teleportation
is instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane. Anything that blocks astral
travel also blocks teleportation.</p></section><section id="h5-15-divination"><h5>점술</h5><p>Divination
spells enable you to learn secrets long forgotten, to predict the future, to
find hidden things, and to foil deceptive spells.</p><p>Many
divination spells have cone-shaped areas. These move with you and extend in the
direction you look. The cone defines the area that you can sweep each round. If
you study the same area for multiple rounds, you can often gain additional
information, as noted in the descriptive text for the spell.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Scrying:</span><span> A scrying spell creates
an invisible magical sensor that sends you information. Unless noted otherwise,
the sensor has the same powers of sensory acuity that you possess. This level
of acuity includes any spells or effects that target you, but not spells or
effects that emanate from you. However, the sensor is treated as a separate,
independent sensory organ of yours, and thus it functions normally even if you
have been blinded, deafened, or otherwise suffered sensory impairment.</span></p><p>Any
creature with an Intelligence score of 12 or higher can notice the sensor by
making a DC 20 Intelligence check. The sensor can be dispelled as if it were an
active spell.</p><p>Lead
sheeting or magical protection blocks a scrying spell, and you sense that the
spell is so blocked.</p></section><section id="h5-16-enchantment"><h5>마력부여술</h5><p>Enchantment
spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior.</p><p>All
enchantments are mind-affecting spells. Two types of enchantment spells grant
you influence over a subject creature.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Charm:</span><span> A charm spell changes how
the subject views you, typically making it see you as a good friend.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Compulsion:</span><span> A compulsion spell forces
the subject to act in some manner or changes the way her mind works. Some
compulsion spells determine the subject’s actions or the effects on the
subject, some compulsion spells allow you to determine the subject’s actions when
you cast the spell, and others give you ongoing control over the subject.</span></p></section><section id="h5-17-evocation"><h5>환기</h5><p>Evocation
spells manipulate energy or tap an unseen source of power to produce a desired
end. In effect, they create something out of nothing. Many of these spells
produce spectacular effects, and evocation spells can deal large amounts of
damage.</p></section><section id="h5-18-illusion"><h5>환상</h5><p>Illusion
spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things
that are not there, not see things that are there, hear phantom noises, or
remember things that never happened.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Figment:</span><span> A figment spell creates a
false sensation. Those who perceive the figment perceive the same thing, not
their own slightly different versions of the figment. (It is not a personalized
mental impression.) Figments cannot make something seem to be something else. A
figment that includes audible effects cannot duplicate intelligible speech
unless the spell description specifically says it can. If intelligible speech
is possible, it must be in a language you can speak. If you try to duplicate a
language you cannot speak, the image produces gibberish. Likewise, you cannot
make a visual copy of something unless you know what it looks like.</span></p><p>Because
figments and glamers (see below) are unreal, they cannot produce real effects
the way that other types of illusions can. They cannot cause damage to objects
or creatures, support weight, provide nutrition, or provide protection from the
elements. Consequently, these spells are useful for confounding or delaying
foes, but useless for attacking them directly. </p><p>A
figment’s AC is equal to 10 + its size modifier.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Glamer:</span><span> A glamer spell changes a
subject’s sensory qualities, making it look, feel, taste, smell, or sound like
something else, or even seem to disappear.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Pattern:</span><span> Like a figment, a pattern
spell creates an image that others can see, but a pattern also affects the
minds of those who see it or are caught in it. All patterns are mind-affecting
spells.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Phantasm:
</span><span>A
phantasm spell creates a mental image that usually only the caster and the
subject (or subjects) of the spell can perceive. This impression is totally in
the minds of the subjects. It is a personalized mental impression. (It’s all in
their heads and not a fake picture or something that they actually see.) Third
parties viewing or studying the scene don’t notice the phantasm. All phantasms
are mind-affecting spells.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Shadow:</span><span> A shadow spell creates
something that is partially real from extradimensional energy. Such illusions
can have real effects. Damage dealt by a shadow illusion is real.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Saving
Throws and Illusions (Disbelief ): </span><span>Creatures encountering an illusion
usually do not receive saving throws to recognize it as illusory until they
study it carefully or interact with it in some fashion.</span></p><p>A
successful saving throw against an illusion reveals it to be false, but a
figment or phantasm remains as a translucent outline.</p><p>A
failed saving throw indicates that a character fails to notice something is
amiss. A character faced with proof that an illusion isn’t real needs no saving
throw. If any viewer successfully disbelieves an illusion and communicates this
fact to others, each such viewer gains a saving throw with a +4 bonus.</p></section><section id="h5-19-necromancy"><h5>강령술</h5><p>Necromancy
spells manipulate the power of death, unlife, and the life force. Spells
involving undead creatures make up a large part of this school. </p></section><section id="h5-20-transmutation"><h5>변환</h5><p>Transmutation
spells change the properties of some creature, thing, or condition. </p></section></section><section id="h3-21-descriptor"><h3>[표지]</h3><p>Appearing
on the same line as the school and subschool, when applicable, is a descriptor
that further categorizes the spell in some way. Some spells have more than one
descriptor.</p><p>The
descriptors are acid, air, chaotic, cold, darkness, death, earth, electricity,
evil, fear, fire, force, good, language-dependent, lawful, light,
mind-affecting, sonic, and water.</p><p>Most
of these descriptors have no game effect by themselves, but they govern how the
spell interacts with other spells, with special abilities, with unusual
creatures, with alignment, and so on.</p><p>A
language-dependent spell uses intelligible language as a medium for
communication. If the target cannot understand or cannot hear what the caster
of a language-dependant spell says the spell fails.</p><p>A
mind-affecting spell works only against creatures with an Intelligence score of
1 or higher.</p></section><section id="h3-22-level"><h3>레벨</h3><p>The
next line of a spell description gives the spell’s level, a number between 0
and 9 that defines the spell’s relative power. This number is preceded by an
abbreviation for the class whose members can cast the spell. The Level entry
also indicates whether a spell is a domain spell and, if so, what its domain
and its level as a domain spell are. A spell’s level affects the DC for any
save allowed against the effect.</p><p>Names
of spellcasting classes are abbreviated as follows: bard Brd; cleric Clr; druid
Drd; paladin Pal; ranger Rgr; sorcerer Sor; wizard Wiz.</p><p>The
domains a spell can be associated with include Air, Animal, Chaos, Death,
Destruction, Earth, Evil, Fire, Good, Healing, Knowledge, Law, Luck, Magic,
Plant, Protection, Strength, Sun, Travel, Trickery, War, and Water.</p></section><section id="h3-23-components"><h3>구성요소</h3><p>A
spell’s components are what you must do or possess to cast it. The Components
entry in a spell description includes abbreviations that tell you what type of
components it has. Specifics for material, focus, and XP components are given
at the end of the descriptive text. Usually you don’t worry about components,
but when you can’t use a component for some reason or when a material or focus
component is expensive, then the components are important.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Verbal
(V):</span><span> A
verbal component is a spoken incantation. To provide a verbal component, you
must be able to speak in a strong voice. A <span style="font-style: italic;">silence </span>spell or a gag spoils
the incantation (and thus the spell). A spellcaster who has been deafened has a
20% chance to spoil any spell with a verbal component that he or she tries to
cast.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Somatic
(S):</span><span> A
somatic component is a measured and precise movement of the hand. You must have
at least one hand free to provide a somatic component.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Material
(M):</span><span> A
material component is one or more physical substances or objects that are
annihilated by the spell energies in the casting process. Unless a cost is
given for a material component, the cost is negligible. Don’t bother to keep
track of material components with negligible cost. Assume you have all you need
as long as you have your spell component pouch.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Focus
(F): </span><span>A
focus component is a prop of some sort. Unlike a material component, a focus is
not consumed when the spell is cast and can be reused. As with material
components, the cost for a focus is negligible unless a price is given. Assume
that focus components of negligible cost are in your spell component pouch.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Divine
Focus (DF):</span><span>
A divine focus component is an item of spiritual significance. The divine focus
for a cleric or a paladin is a holy symbol appropriate to the character’s
faith. </span></p><p>If
the Components line includes F/DF or M/DF, the arcane version of the spell has
a focus component or a material component (the abbreviation before the slash)
and the divine version has a divine focus component (the abbreviation after the
slash).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">XP
Cost (XP):</span><span>
Some powerful spells entail an experience point cost to you. No spell can
restore the XP lost in this manner. You cannot spend so much XP that you lose a
level, so you cannot cast the spell unless you have enough XP to spare.
However, you may, on gaining enough XP to attain a new level, use those XP for
casting a spell rather than keeping them and advancing a level. The XP are
treated just like a material component—expended when you cast the spell,
whether or not the casting succeeds.</span></p></section><section id="h3-24-casting-time"><h3>시전 시간</h3><p>Most
spells have a casting time of 1 standard action. Others take 1 round or more,
while a few require only a free action.</p><p>A
spell that takes 1 round to cast is a full-round action. It comes into effect
just before the beginning of your turn in the round after you began casting the
spell. You then act normally after the spell is completed.</p><p>A
spell that takes 1 minute to cast comes into effect just before your turn 1
minute later (and for each of those 10 rounds, you are casting a spell as a
full-round action, just as noted above for 1- round casting times). These
actions must be consecutive and uninterrupted, or the spell automatically
fails.</p><p>When
you begin a spell that takes 1 round or longer to cast, you must continue the
concentration from the current round to just before your turn in the next round
(at least). If you lose concentration before the casting is complete, you lose
the spell.</p><p>A
spell with a casting time of 1 free action doesn’t count against your normal
limit of one spell per round. However, you may cast such a spell only once per
round. Casting a spell with a casting time of 1 free action doesn’t provoke
attacks of opportunity.</p><p>You
make all pertinent decisions about a spell (range, target, area, effect, version,
and so forth) when the spell comes into effect.</p></section><section id="h3-25-range"><h3>범위</h3><p>A
spell’s range indicates how far from you it can reach, as defined in the Range
entry of the spell description. A spell’s range is the maximum distance from
you that the spell’s effect can occur, as well as the maximum distance at which
you can designate the spell’s point of origin. If any portion of the spell’s
area would extend beyond this range, that area is wasted. Standard ranges
include the following.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Personal:</span><span> The spell affects only
you.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Touch:</span><span> You must touch a creature
or object to affect it. A touch spell that deals damage can score a critical
hit just as a weapon can. A touch spell threatens a critical hit on a natural
roll of 20 and deals double damage on a successful critical hit. Some touch
spells allow you to touch multiple targets. You can touch as many willing
targets as you can reach as part of the casting, but all targets of the spell
must be touched in the same round that you finish casting the spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Close:</span><span> The spell reaches as far
as 25 feet away from you. The maximum range increases by 5 feet for every two
full caster levels.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Medium:</span><span> The spell reaches as far
as 100 feet + 10 feet per caster level.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Long:</span><span> The spell reaches as far
as 400 feet + 40 feet per caster level.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Unlimited:</span><span> The spell reaches
anywhere on the same plane of existence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Range
Expressed in Feet:</span><span> Some spells have no standard range category, just a range
expressed in feet.</span></p></section><section id="h3-26-aiming-a-spell"><h3>주문 조준하기</h3><p>You must make
some choice about whom the spell is to affect or where the effect is to
originate, depending on the type of spell. The next entry in a spell
description defines the spell’s target (or targets), its effect, or its area,
as appropriate.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Target
or Targets:</span><span>
Some spellshave a target or targets. You cast these spells on creatures
or objects, as defined by the spell itself. You must be able to see or touch
the target, and you must specifically choose that target. You do not have to
select your target until you finish casting the spell.</span></p><p>If
the target of a spell is yourself (the spell description has a line that reads
Target: You), you do not receive a saving throw, and spell resistance does not
apply. The Saving Throw and Spell Resistance lines are omitted from such
spells.</p><p>Some
spells restrict you to willing targets only. Declaring yourself as a willing
target is something that can be done at any time (even if you’re flat-footed or
it isn’t your turn). Unconscious creatures are automatically considered
willing, but a character who is conscious but immobile or helpless (such as one
who is bound, cowering, grappling, paralyzed, pinned, or stunned) is not
automatically willing.</p><p>Some
spells allow you to redirect the effect to new targets or areas after you cast
the spell. Redirecting a spell is a move action that does not provoke attacks
of opportunity.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Effect:</span><span> Some spells create or
summon things rather than affecting things that are already present.</span></p><p>You
must designate the location where these things are to appear, either by seeing
it or defining it. Range determines how far away an effect can appear, but if
the effect is mobile it can move regardless of the spell’s range.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ray:
</span><span>Some
effects are rays. You aim a ray as if using a ranged weapon, though typically
you make a ranged touch attack rather than a normal ranged attack. As with a
ranged weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an invisible creature and hope
you hit something. You don’t have to see the creature you’re trying to hit, as
you do with a targeted spell. Intervening creatures and obstacles, however, can
block your line of sight or provide cover for the creature you’re aiming at.</span></p><p>If
a ray spell has a duration, it’s the duration of the effect that the ray
causes, not the length of time the ray itself persists.</p><p>If
a ray spell deals damage, you can score a critical hit just as if it were a
weapon. A ray spell threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals
double damage on a successful critical hit.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Spread:
</span><span>Some
effects, notably clouds and fogs, spread out from a point of origin, which must
be a grid intersection. The effect can extend around corners and into areas
that you can’t see. Figure distance by actual distance traveled, taking into
account turns the spell effect takes. When determining distance for spread
effects, count around walls, not through them. As with movement, do not trace
diagonals across corners. You must designate the point of origin for such an
effect, but you need not have line of effect (see below) to all portions of the
effect.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Area:</span><span> Some spells affect an
area. Sometimes a spell description specifies a specially defined area, but
usually an area falls into one of the categories defined below.</span></p><p>Regardless
of the shape of the area, you select the point where the spell originates, but
otherwise you don’t control which creatures or objects the spell affects. The
point of origin of a spell is always a grid intersection. When determining
whether a given creature is within the area of a spell, count out the distance
from the point of origin in squares just as you do when moving a character or when
determining the range for a ranged attack. The only difference is that instead
of counting from the center of one square to the center of the next, you count
from intersection to intersection.</p><p>You
can count diagonally across a square, but remember that every second diagonal
counts as 2 squares of distance. If the far edge of a square is within the
spell’s area, anything within that square is within the spell’s area. If the
spell’s area only touches the near edge of a square, however, anything within that
square is unaffected by the spell.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Burst,
Emanation, or Spread: </span><span>Most spells that affect an area function as a burst, an
emanation, or a spread. In each case, you select the spell’s point of origin
and measure its effect from that point.</span></p><p>A
burst spell affects whatever it catches in its area, even including creatures
that you can’t see. It can’t affect creatures with total cover from its point
of origin (in other words, its effects don’t extend around corners). The
default shape for a burst effect is a sphere, but some burst spells are
specifically described as cone-shaped. A burst’s area defines how far from the
point of origin the spell’s effect extends.</p><p>An
emanation spell functions like a burst spell, except that the effect continues
to radiate from the point of origin for the duration of the spell. Most
emanations are cones or spheres.</p><p>A
spread spell spreads out like a burst but can turn corners. You select the
point of origin, and the spell spreads out a given distance in all directions.
Figure the area the spell effect fills by taking into account any turns the
spell effect takes.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Cone,
Cylinder, Line, or Sphere: </span><span>Most spells that affect an area have a particular shape, such
as a cone, cylinder, line, or sphere.</span></p><p>A
cone-shaped spell shoots away from you in a quarter-circle in the direction you
designate. It starts from any corner of your square and widens out as it goes.
Most cones are either bursts or emanations (see above), and thus won’t go
around corners.</p><p>When
casting a cylinder-shaped spell, you select the spell’s point of origin. This
point is the center of a horizontal circle, and the spell shoots down from the
circle, filling a cylinder. A cylinder-shaped spell ignores any obstructions
within its area.</p><p>A
line-shaped spell shoots away from you in a line in the direction you
designate. It starts from any corner of your square and extends to the limit of
its range or until it strikes a barrier that blocks line of effect. A
line-shaped spell affects all creatures in squares that the line passes through.</p><p>A
sphere-shaped spell expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical area.
Spheres may be bursts, emanations, or spreads.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Creatures:
</span><span>A spell
with this kind of area affects creatures directly (like a targeted spell), but
it affects all creatures in an area of some kind rather than individual
creatures you select. The area might be a spherical burst , a cone-shaped
burst, or some other shape.</span></p><p>Many
spells affect “living creatures,” which means all creatures other than
constructs and undead. Creatures in the spell’s area that are not of the
appropriate type do not count against the creatures affected.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Objects:
</span><span>A spell
with this kind of area affects objects within an area you select (as Creatures,
but affecting objects instead).</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Other:
</span><span>A spell
can have a unique area, as defined in its description.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">(S)
Shapeable: </span><span>If
an Area or Effect entry ends with “(S),” you can shape the spell. A shaped
effect or area can have no dimension smaller than 10 feet. Many effects or
areas are given as cubes to make it easy to model irregular shapes.
Three-dimensional volumes are most often needed to define aerial or underwater
effects and areas.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Line
of Effect:</span><span>
A line of effect is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what a spell can
affect. A line of effect is canceled by a solid barrier. It’s like line of
sight for ranged weapons, except that it’s not blocked by fog, darkness, and
other factors that limit normal sight.</span></p><p>You
must have a clear line of effect to any target that you cast a spell on or to
any space in which you wish to create an effect. You must have a clear line of
effect to the point of origin of any spell you cast<span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p>A
burst, cone, cylinder, or emanation spell affects only an area, creatures, or
objects to which it has line of effect from its origin (a spherical burst’s
center point, a cone-shaped burst’s starting point, a cylinder’s circle, or an
emanation’s point of origin).</p><p>An
otherwise solid barrier with a hole of at least 1 square foot through it does
not block a spell’s line of effect. Such an opening means that the 5-foot length
of wall containing the hole is no longer considered a barrier for purposes of a
spell’s line of effect.</p></section><section id="h3-27-duration"><h3>지속시간</h3><p>A
spell’s Duration entry tells you how long the magical energy of the spell
lasts.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Timed
Durations: </span><span>Many
durations are measured in rounds, minutes, hours, or some other increment. When
the time is up, the magic goes away and the spell ends. If a spell’s duration
is variable the duration is rolled secretly (the caster doesn’t know how long
the spell will last). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Instantaneous:</span><span> The spell energy comes
and goes the instant the spell is cast, though the consequences might be
long-lasting.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Permanent:
</span><span>The
energy remains as long as the effect does. This means the spell is vulnerable
to <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel magic</span>. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Concentration:</span><span> The spell lasts as long
as you concentrate on it. Concentrating to maintain a spell is a standard
action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Anything that could break
your concentration when casting a spell can also break your concentration while
you’re maintaining one, causing the spell to end.</span></p><p>You
can’t cast a spell while concentrating on another one. Sometimes a spell lasts
for a short time after you cease concentrating.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Subjects,
Effects, and Areas:</span><span> If the spell affects creatures directly the result travels
with the subjects for the spell’s duration. If the spell creates an effect, the
effect lasts for the duration. The effect might move or remain still. Such an
effect can be destroyed prior to when its duration ends. If the spell affects
an area then the spell stays with that area for its duration. </span></p><p>Creatures
become subject to the spell when they enter the area and are no longer subject
to it when they leave.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Touch
Spells and Holding the Charge:</span><span> In most cases, if you don’t discharge a touch spell
on the round you cast it, you can hold the charge (postpone the discharge of
the spell) indefinitely. You can make touch attacks round after round. If you
cast another spell, the touch spell dissipates.</span></p><p>Some
touch spellsallow you to touch multiple targets as part of the spell.
You can’t hold the charge of such a spell; you must touch all targets of the
spell in the same round that you finish casting the spell.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Discharge:</span><span> Occasionally a spells
lasts for a set duration or until triggered or discharged.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">(D)
Dismissible:</span><span>
If the Duration line ends with “(D),” you can dismiss the spell at will. You
must be within range of the spell’s effect and must speak words of dismissal,
which are usually a modified form of the spell’s verbal component. If the spell
has no verbal component, you can dismiss the effect with a gesture. Dismissing
a spell is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</span></p><p>A
spell that depends on concentration is dismissible by its very nature, and
dismissing it does not take an action, since all you have to do to end the
spell is to stop concentrating on your turn.</p></section><section id="h3-28-saving-throw"><h3>내성 굴림</h3><p>Usually
a harmful spell allows a target to make a saving throw to avoid some or all of
the effect. The Saving Throw entry in a spell description defines which type of
saving throw the spell allows and describes how saving throws against the spell
work.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Negates:
</span><span>The spell
has no effect on a subject that makes a successful saving throw.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Partial:</span><span> The spell causes an
effect on its subject. A successful saving throw means that some lesser effect
occurs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Half:</span><span> The spell deals damage,
and a successful saving throw halves the damage taken (round down).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">None:</span><span> No saving throw is
allowed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Disbelief:</span><span> A successful save lets
the subject ignore the effect. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">(object):</span><span> The spell can be cast on
objects, which receive saving throws only if they are magical or if they are
attended (held, worn, grasped, or the like) by a creature resisting the spell,
in which case the object uses the creature’s saving throw bonus unless its own
bonus is greater. (This notation does not mean that a spell can be cast only on
objects. Some spells of this sort can be cast on creatures or objects.) A magic
item’s saving throw bonuses are each equal to 2 + one-half the item’s caster
level. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">(harmless):</span><span> The spell is usually
beneficial, not harmful, but a targeted creature can attempt a saving throw if
it desires.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Saving
Throw Difficulty Class:</span><span> A saving throw against your spell has a DC of 10 + the level
of the spell + your bonus for the relevant ability (Intelligence for a wizard,
Charisma for a sorcerer or bard, or Wisdom for a cleric, druid, paladin, or
ranger). A spell’s level can vary depending on your class. Always use the spell
level applicable to your class.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Succeeding
on a Saving Throw: </span><span>A creature that successfully saves against a spell that has
no obvious physical effects feels a hostile force or a tingle, but cannot
deduce the exact nature of the attack. Likewise, if a creature’s saving throw
succeeds against a targeted spell you sense that the spell has failed. You do
not sense when creatures succeed on saves against effect and area spells.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Automatic
Failures and Successes:</span><span> A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a saving throw is always
a failure, and the spell may cause damage to exposed items (see Items Surviving
after a Saving Throw, below). A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a
success.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Voluntarily
Giving up a Saving Throw:</span><span> A creature can voluntarily forego a saving throw and
willingly accept a spell’s result. Even a character with a special resistance
to magic can suppress this quality.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Items
Surviving after a Saving Throw:</span><span> Unless the descriptive text for the spell specifies
otherwise, all items carried or worn by a creature are assumed to survive a
magical attack. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw against the
effect, however, an exposed item is harmed (if the attack can harm objects).
Refer to Table: Items Affected by Magical Attacks. Determine which four objects
carried or worn by the creature are most likely to be affected and roll
randomly among them. The randomly determined item must make a saving throw
against the attack form and take whatever damage the attack deal.</span></p><p>If
an item is not carried or worn and is not magical, it does not get a saving
throw. It simply is dealt the appropriate damage.</p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 28.1251em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="break-inside: avoid; vertical-align: middle;"><td colspan="2" style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Table: Items Affected by

resistance is a special defensive ability. If your spell is being resisted by a
creature with spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 +
caster level) at least equal to the creature’s spell resistance for the spell
to affect that creature. The defender’s spell resistance is like an Armor Class
against magical attacks. Include any adjustments to your caster level to this
caster level check.</p><p>The
Spell Resistance entry and the descriptive text of a spell description tell you
whether spell resistance protects creatures from the spell. In many cases,
spell resistance applies only when a resistant creature is targeted by the
spell, not when a resistant creature encounters a spell that is already in
place.</p><p>The
terms “object” and “harmless” mean the same thing for spell resistance as they
do for saving throws. A creature with spell resistance must voluntarily lower
the resistance (a standard action) in order to be affected by a spell noted as
harmless. In such a case, you do not need to make the caster level check
described above.</p></section><section id="h3-30-descriptive-text"><h3>설명 문구</h3><p>This
portion of a spell description details what the spell does and how it works. If
one of the previous entries in the description included “see text,” this is
where the explanation is found. </p></section></section><section id="h2-31-arcane-spells"><h2>비전 주문</h2><p>Wizards,
sorcerers, and bards cast arcane spells. Compared to divine spells, arcane
spells are more likely to produce dramatic results.</p><section id="h3-32-preparing-wizard-spells"><h3>마법사 주문 준비</h3><p>A
wizard’s level limits the number of spells she can prepare and cast. Her high
Intelligence score might allow her to prepare a few extra spells. She can
prepare the same spell more than once, but each preparation counts as one spell
toward her daily limit. To prepare a spell the wizard must have an Intelligence
score of at least 10 + the spell’s level.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Rest:
</span><span>To
prepare her daily spells, a wizard must first sleep for 8 hours. The wizard
does not have to slumber for every minute of the time, but she must refrain
from movement, combat, spellcasting, skill use, conversation, or any other
fairly demanding physical or mental task during the rest period. If her rest is
interrupted, each interruption adds 1 hour to the total amount of time she has
to rest in order to clear her mind, and she must have at least 1 hour of
uninterrupted rest immediately prior to preparing her spells. If the character
does not need to sleep for some reason, she still must have 8 hours of restful
calm before preparing any spells. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Recent
Casting Limit/Rest Interruptions:</span><span> If a wizard has cast spells recently, the drain on her
resources reduces her capacity to prepare new spells. When she prepares spells
for the coming day, all the spells she has cast within the last 8 hours count
against her daily limit.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Preparation
Environment:</span><span>
To prepare any spell, a wizard must have enough peace, quiet, and comfort to
allow for proper concentration. The wizard’s surroundings need not be
luxurious, but they must be free from overt distractions. Exposure to inclement
weather prevents the necessary concentration, as does any injury or failed
saving throw the character might experience while studying. Wizards also must
have access to their spellbooks to study from and sufficient light to read them
by. There is one major exception: A wizard can prepare a <span style="font-style: italic;">read magic </span>spell
even without a spellbook. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell
Preparation Time:</span><span> After resting, a wizard must study her spellbook to prepare
any spells that day. If she wants to prepare all her spells, the process takes
1 hour. Preparing some smaller portion of her daily capacity takes a
proportionally smaller amount of time, but always at least 15 minutes, the
minimum time required to achieve the proper mental state.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell
Selection and Preparation:</span><span> Until she prepares spells from her spellbook, the only
spells a wizard has available to cast are the ones that she already had
prepared from the previous day and has not yet used. During the study period,
she chooses which spells to prepare. If a wizard already has spells prepared
(from the previous day) that she has not cast, she can abandon some or all of
them to make room for new spells.</span></p><p>When
preparing spells for the day, a wizard can leave some of these spell slots
open. Later during that day, she can repeat the preparation process as often as
she likes, time and circumstances permitting. During these extra sessions of
preparation, the wizard can fill these unused spell slots. She cannot, however,
abandon a previously prepared spell to replace it with another one or fill a
slot that is empty because she has cast a spell in the meantime. That sort of
preparation requires a mind fresh from rest. Like the first session of the day,
this preparation takes at least 15 minutes, and it takes longer if the wizard
prepares more than one-quarter of her spells.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell
Slots:</span><span>
The various character class tables show how many spells of each level a
character can cast per day. These openings for daily spells are called spell
slots. A spellcaster always has the option to fill a higher-level spell slot
with a lower-level spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high enough ability score
to cast spells that would otherwise be his or her due still gets the slots but
must fill them with spells of lower level.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prepared
Spell Retention:</span><span>
Once a wizard prepares a spell, it remains in her mind as a nearly cast spell
until she uses the prescribed components to complete and trigger it or until
she abandons it. Certain other events, such as the effects of magic items or
special attacks from monsters, can wipe a prepared spell from a character’s
mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Death
and Prepared Spell Retention:</span><span> If a spellcaster dies, all prepared spells stored in his or
her mind are wiped away. Potent magic (such as <span style="font-style: italic;">raise dead, resurrection, </span>or
<span style="font-style: italic;">true resurrection</span>) can recover the lost energy when it recovers the
character.</span></p></section><section id="h3-33-arcane-magical-writings"><h3>비전 마법 작성</h3><p>To
record an arcane spell in written form, a character uses complex notation that
describes the magical forces involved in the spell. The writer uses the same
system no matter what her native language or culture. However, each character uses
the system in her own way. Another person’s magical writing remains
incomprehensible to even the most powerful wizard until she takes time to study
and decipher it.</p><p>To
decipher an arcane magical writing (such as a single spell in written form in
another’s spellbook or on a scroll), a character must make a Spellcraft check
(DC 20 + the spell’s level). If the skill check fails, the character cannot
attempt to read that particular spell again until the next day. A <span style="font-style: italic;">read magic
</span>spell automatically deciphers a magical writing without a skill check. If
the person who created the magical writing is on hand to help the reader,
success is also automatic.</p><p>Once
a character deciphers a particular magical writing, she does not need to
decipher it again. Deciphering a magical writing allows the reader to identify
the spell and gives some idea of its effects (as explained in the spell
description). If the magical writing was a scroll and the reader can cast
arcane spells, she can attempt to use the scroll.</p><p>Wizard
Spells and Borrowed Spellbooks</p><p>A
wizard can use a borrowed spellbook to prepare a spell she already knows and
has recorded in her own spellbook, but preparation success is not assured.
First, the wizard must decipher the writing in the book (see Arcane Magical Writings,
above). Once a spell from another spellcaster’s book is deciphered, the reader
must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell’s level) to prepare the spell. If
the check succeeds, the wizard can prepare the spell. She must repeat the check
to prepare the spell again, no matter how many times she has prepared it
before. If the check fails, she cannot try to prepare the spell from the same
source again until the next day. (However, as explained above, she does not
need to repeat a check to decipher the writing.)</p><p>Adding
Spells to a Wizard’s Spellbook</p><p>Wizards
can add new spells to their spellbooks through several methods. If a wizard has
chosen to specialize in a school of magic, she can learn spells only from
schools whose spells she can cast.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spells
Gained at a New Level: </span><span>Wizards perform a certain amount of spell research between
adventures. Each time a character attains a new wizard level, she gains two
spells of her choice to add to her spellbook. The two free spells must be of
spell levels she can cast. If she has chosen to specialize in a school of
magic, one of the two free spells must be from her specialty school.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spells
Copied from Another’s Spellbook or a Scroll:</span><span> A wizard can also add a spell to her
book whenever she encounters one on a magic scroll or in another wizard’s
spellbook. No matter what the spell’s source, the wizard must first decipher
the magical writing (see Arcane Magical Writings, above). Next, she must spend
a day studying the spell. At the end of the day, she must make a Spellcraft
check (DC 15 + spell’s level). A wizard who has specialized in a school of
spells gains a +2 bonus on the Spellcraft check if the new spell is from her
specialty school. She cannot, however, learn any spells from her prohibited
schools. If the check succeeds, the wizard understands the spell and can copy
it into her spellbook (see Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook, below). The
process leaves a spellbook that was copied from unharmed, but a spell
successfully copied from a magic scroll disappears from the parchment.</span></p><p>If
the check fails, the wizard cannot understand or copy the spell. She cannot
attempt to learn or copy that spell again until she gains another rank in
Spellcraft. A spell that was being copied from a scroll does not vanish from
the scroll.</p><p>In
most cases, wizards charge a fee for the privilege of copying spells from their
spellbooks. This fee is usually equal to the spell’s level x50 gp.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Independent
Research:</span><span>
A wizard also can research a spell independently, duplicating an existing spell
or creating an entirely new one.</span></p><p>Writing
a New Spell into a Spellbook</p><p>Once
a wizard understands a new spell, she can record it into her spellbook.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Time:</span><span> The process takes 24
hours, regardless of the spell’s level.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Space
in the Spellbook:</span><span> A spell takes up one page of the spellbook per spell level.
Even a 0-level spell (cantrip) takes one page. A spellbook has one hundred
pages.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Materials
and Costs:</span><span>
Materials for writing the spell cost 100 gp per page.</span></p><p>Note
that a wizard does not have to pay these costs in time or gold for the spells
she gains for free at each new level. </p><p>Replacing
and Copying Spellbooks</p><p>A
wizard can use the procedure for learning a spell to reconstruct a lost
spellbook. If she already has a particular spell prepared, she can write it
directly into a new book at a cost of 100 gp per page (as noted in Writing a
New Spell into a Spellbook, above). The process wipes the prepared spell from
her mind, just as casting it would. If she does not have the spell prepared,
she can prepare it from a borrowed spellbook and then write it into a new book.</p><p>Duplicating
an existing spellbook uses the same procedure as replacing it, but the task is
much easier. The time requirement and cost per page are halved.</p><p>Selling
a Spellbook</p><p>Captured
spellbooks can be sold for a gp amount equal to one-half the cost of purchasing
and inscribing the spells within (that is, one-half of 100 gp per page of
spells). A spellbook entirely filled with spells (that is, with one hundred
pages of spells inscribed in it) is worth 5,000 gp.</p></section><section id="h3-34-sorcerers-and-bards"><h3>소서러와 음유시인</h3><p>Sorcerers
and bards cast arcane spells, but they do not have spellbooks and do not
prepare their spells. A sorcerer’s or bard’s class level limits the number of
spells he can cast (see these class descriptions). His high Charisma score
might allow him to cast a few extra spells. A member of either class must have
a Charisma score of at least 10 + a spell’s level to cast the spell.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Daily
Readying of Spells:</span><span> Each day, sorcerers and bards must focus their minds on the
task of casting their spells. A sorcerer or bard needs 8 hours of rest (just
like a wizard), after which he spends 15 minutes concentrating. (A bard must
sing, recite, or play an instrument of some kind while concentrating.) During
this period, the sorcerer or bard readies his mind to cast his daily allotment
of spells. Without such a period to refresh himself, the character does not
regain the spell slots he used up the day before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Recent

or Table: Sorcerer Spells Known to learn how many spells from the appropriate
spell list he now knows. With permission, sorcerers and bards can also select
the spells they gain from new and unusual spells that they have gained some
understanding of.</span></p></section></section><section id="h2-35-divine-spells"><h2>신성 주문</h2><p>Clerics,
druids, experienced paladins, and experienced rangers can cast divine spells.
Unlike arcane spells, divine spells draw power from a divine source. Clerics
gain spell power from deities or from divine forces. The divine force of nature
powers druid and ranger spells. The divine forces of law and good power paladin
spells. Divine spells tend to focus on healing and protection and are less
flashy, destructive, and disruptive than arcane spells.</p><section id="h3-36-preparing-divine-spells"><h3>신성 주문 준비</h3><p>Divine
spellcasters prepare their spells in largely the same manner as wizards do, but
with a few differences. The relevant ability for divine spells is Wisdom. To
prepare a divine spell, a character must have a Wisdom score of 10 + the
spell’s level. Likewise, bonus spells are based on Wisdom.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Time
of Day:</span><span> A
divine spellcaster chooses and prepares spells ahead of time, just as a wizard
does. However, a divine spellcaster does not require a period of rest to
prepare spells. Instead, the character chooses a particular part of the day to
pray and receive spells. The time is usually associated with some daily event.
If some event prevents a character from praying at the proper time, he must do
so as soon as possible. If the character does not stop to pray for spells at
the first opportunity, he must wait until the next day to prepare spells.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell
Selection and Preparation:</span><span> A divine spellcaster selects and prepares spells ahead of
time through prayer and meditation at a particular time of day. The time
required to prepare spells is the same as it is for a wizard (1 hour), as is
the requirement for a relatively peaceful environment. A divine spellcaster
does not have to prepare all his spells at once. However, the character’s mind
is considered fresh only during his or her first daily spell preparation, so a
divine spellcaster cannot fill a slot that is empty because he or she has cast
a spell or abandoned a previously prepared spell.</span></p><p>Divine
spellcasters do not require spellbooks. However, such a character’s spell
selection is limited to the spells on the list for his or her class. Clerics,
druids, paladins, and rangers have separate spell lists. A cleric also has
access to two domains determined during his character creation. Each domain
gives him access to a domain spell at each spell level from 1st to 9th, as well
as a special granted power. With access to two domain spells at each spell
level—one from each of his two domains—a cleric must prepare, as an extra
domain spell, one or the other each day for each level of spell he can cast. If
a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, it can be prepared only in a
domain spell slot.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell
Slots:</span><span>
The character class tables show how many spells of each level a character can

openings for daily spells are called spell slots. A spellcaster always has the

of lower level. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Recent

Spells come in two types: arcane (cast by\nbards, sorcerers, and wizards) and divine (cast by clerics, druids, and\nexperienced paladins and rangers). Some spellcasters select their spells from a\nlimited list of spells known, while others have access to a wide variety of\noptions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost\nspellcasters prepare their spells in advance—whether from a spellbook or\nthrough devout prayers and meditation— while some cast spells spontaneously\nwithout preparation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite\nthese different ways that characters use to learn or prepare their spells, when\nit comes to casting them, the spells are very much alike.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCutting across\nthe categories of arcane and divine spells are the eight schools of magic.\nThese schools represent the different ways that spells take effect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003csection id=\"h2-1-casting-spells\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003e주문 시전하기\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhether\na spell is arcane or divine, and whether a character prepares spells in advance\nor chooses them on the spot, casting a spell works the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003csection id=\"h3-2-choosing-a-spell\"\u003e\u003ch3\u003e주문 선택하기\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst\nyou must choose which spell to cast.

(If you’ve prepared multiple copies of a single spell, you can cast each\ncopy once.) If you’re a bard or sorcerer, casting a spell counts against your\ndaily limit for spells of that spell level, but you can cast the same spell\nagain if you haven’t reached your limit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003csection id=\"h3-3-concentration\"\u003e\u003ch3\u003e집중\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo\ncast a spell, you must concentrate. If something interrupts your concentration\nwhile you’re casting, you must make a Concentration check or lose the spell.\nThe more distracting the interruption and the higher the level of the spell you\nare trying to cast, the higher the DC is.

If you fail the check,\nyou lose the spell without effect. The interrupting event strikes during\nspellcasting if it comes between when you start and when you complete a spell\n(for a spell with a casting time of 1 full round or more) or if it comes in\nresponse to your casting the spell (such as an attack of opportunity provoked\nby the spell or a contingent attack, such as a readied action).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf\nyou are taking continuous damage half the damage is considered to take place\nwhile you are casting a spell.
