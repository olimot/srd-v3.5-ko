Game Content, and is licensed for public use under the terms of the Open Game
License v1.0a.</p><section id="h1-0-psionic-feats"><h1>사이오닉 특기</h1><p>Psionic feats
are available only to characters and creatures with the ability to manifest
powers. (In other words, they either have a power point reserve or have
psi-like abilities.)</p><p>Because psionic
feats are supernatural abilities—a departure from the general rule that feats
do not grant supernatural abilities—they cannot be disrupted in combat (as
powers can be) and generally do not provoke attacks of opportunity (except as
noted in their descriptions). Supernatural abilities are not subject to power
resistance and cannot be dispelled; however, they do not function in areas
where psionics is suppressed, such as a <span style="font-style: italic;">null psionics field. </span>Leaving
such an area immediately allows psionic feats to be used.</p><p>Many psionic
feats can be used only when you are psionically focused; others require you to
expend your psionic focus to gain their benefit. Expending your psionic focus
does not require an action; it is part of another action (such as using a
feat). When you expend your psionic focus, it applies only to the action for
which you expended it.</p><section id="h3-1-psionic-item-creation-feats"><h3>사이오닉 아이템 제작 특기</h3><p>Manifesters can
use their personal power to create lasting psionic items. Doing so, however, is
draining. A manifester must put a little of himself or herself into every
psionic item he or she creates.</p><p>A psionic item
creation feat lets a manifester create a psionic item of a certain type.
Regardless of the type of items they involve, the various item creation feats
all have certain features in common.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">XP Cost:</span><span> Power and energy that the manifester would normally keep is
expended when making a psionic item. The experience point cost of using a
psionic item creation feat equals 1/25 the cost of the item in gold pieces. A
character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a level.
However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level, he or she can
immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance
a level.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Raw
Materials Cost:</span><span> Creating a psionic item requires
costly components, most of which are consumed in the process. The cost of these
materials equals 1/2 the cost of the item.</span></p><p>Using a psionic
item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or psionic workshop,
special tools, and other equipment. A character generally has access to what he
or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply (such as if he’s traveling far
from home).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Time:</span><span> The time to create a psionic item depends on the feat and the cost
of the item. The minimum time is one day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Item Cost:</span><span> Craft Dorje, Imprint Stone, and Scribe Tattoo create items that
directly reproduce the effects of powers, and the strength of these items
depends on their manifester level—that is, a power from such an item has the
strength it would have if manifested by a manifester of that level. Often, that
is the minimum manifester level necessary to manifest the power. (Randomly
discovered items usually follow this rule.) However, when making such an item,
the item’s strength can be set higher than the minimum. Any time a character
creates an item using a power augmented by spending additional power points,
the character’s effective manifester level for the purpose of calculating the
item’s cost increases by 1 for each 1 additional power point spent.
(Augmentation is a feature of many powers that allows the power to be amplified
in various ways if additional power points are spent.) All other
level-dependent parameters of the power forged into the item are set according
to the effective manifester level.</span></p><p>The price of
psionic items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) depends
on the level of the power and a character’s manifester level. The character’s
manifester level must be high enough that the item creator can manifest the
power at the chosen level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the character’s
manifester level by the power level, then multiply the result by a constant, as
shown below.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Power
Stones: </span><span>Base price = power level x manifester level
x 25 gp</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Psionic
Tattoos: </span><span>Base price = power level x manifester
level x 50 gp</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Dorjes: </span><span>Base price = power level x manifester level x 750 gp</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Extra Costs:</span><span> Any dorje, power stone, or psionic tattoo that stores a power with
an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. </span></p><p>For psionic
tattoos and power stones, the creator must pay the XP cost when creating the
item. For a dorje, the creator must pay fifty times the XP cost. </p><p>Some psionic
items similarly incur extra costs in XP, as noted in their descriptions.</p></section><section id="h3-2-metapsionic-feats"><h3>메타사이오닉 특기</h3><p>As a
manifester’s knowledge of psionics grows, he can learn to manifest powers in
ways slightly different from how the powers were originally designed or
learned. Of course, manifesting a power while using a metapsionic feat is more
expensive than manifesting the power normally.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Manifesting
Time:</span><span> Powers manifested using metapsionic feats
take the same time as manifesting the powers normally unless the feat
description specifically says otherwise.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Manifestation
Cost:</span><span> To use a metapsionic feat, a psionic
character must both expend his psionic focus (see the Concentration skill
description) and pay an increased power point cost as given in the feat
description.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Limits on
Use:</span><span> As with all powers, you cannot spend more
power points on a power than your manifester level. Metapsionic feats merely
let you manifest powers in different ways; they do not let you violate this
rule. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Effects of
Metapsionic Feats on a Power:</span><span> In all ways, a
metapsionic power operates at its original power level, even though it costs
additional power points. The modifications to a power made by a metapsionic
feat have only their noted effect on the power. A manifester can’t use a
metapsionic feat to alter a power being cast from a power stone, dorje, or
other device.</span></p><p>Manifesting a

attempt to manifest your powers against targets that are sheltered behind a
wall or force effect. Your power briefly skips through the Astral Plane to

much damage as the primary one did (round down).</span></p><p>Each target
gets to make a saving throw, if one is allowed by the power. You choose
secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the
primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to
affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in the area,
for example).</p><p>Using this feat

a power. Manifesting a power altered by this feat causes the power to take
effect twice on the area or target, as if you were simultaneously manifesting
the same power two times on the same location or target. Any variables in the
power (such as duration, number of targets, and so on) are the same for both of
the resulting powers. The target experiences all the effects of both powers
individually and receives a saving throw (if applicable) for each. In some
cases, such as a twinned <span style="font-style: italic;">psionic charm</span>, failing both saving throws
results in redundant effects (although, in this example, any ally of the target
would have to succeed on two dispel attempts to free the target from the charm
effect).</span></p><p>Using this feat

walls for brief distances.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Wis 13.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> While you are psionically focused, you can take part of one of your
move actions to traverse a wall or other relatively smooth vertical surface if
you begin and end your move on a horizontal surface. The height you can achieve
on the wall is limited only by this movement restriction. If you do not end
your move on a horizontal surface, you fall prone, taking falling damage as
appropriate for your distance above the ground. Treat the wall as a normal
floor for the purpose of measuring your movement. Passing from floor to wall or
wall to floor costs no movement; you can change surfaces freely. Opponents on
the ground can make attacks of opportunity as you move up the wall.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Special:</span><span> You can take other move actions in conjunction with moving along a
wall. For instance, the Spring Attack feat allows you to make an attack from
the wall against a foe standing on the ground who is within the area you
threaten; however, if you are somehow prevented from completing your move, you
fall. Likewise, you could tumble along the wall to avoid attacks of opportunity.</span></p></section><section id="h3-81-widen-power-metapsionic"><h3>Widen Power [메타사이오닉]</h3><p>You can
increase the area of your powers.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can alter
a burst, emanation, line, or spread-shaped power to increase its area. (Powers
that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this
feat.) Any numeric measurements of the power’s area increase by 100%.</span></p><p>Using this feat
increases the power point cost of the power by 4. The power’s total cost cannot
exceed your manifester level.</p></section><section id="h3-82-wild-talent-general"><h3>Wild Talent [일반]</h3><p>Your mind wakes
to a previously unrealized talent for psionics.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> Your latent power of psionics flares to life, conferring upon you
the designation of a psionic character. As a psionic character, you gain a
reserve of 2 power points and can take psionic feats, metapsionic feats, and
psionic item creation feats. You do not, however, gain the ability to manifest
powers simply by virtue of having this feat.</span></p></section><section id="h3-83-wounding-attack-psionic"><h3>Wounding Attack [사이오닉]</h3><p>Your vicious
attacks wound your foe.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Base attack bonus +8.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can make
an attack with such vicious force that you wound your opponent. A wound deals 1
point of Constitution damage to your foe in addition to the usual damage dealt.</span></p><p>You must decide
whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack
misses, you still expend your psionic focus.</p></section></section></section></div></main></div><nav class="Layout_sidebar__2Jy-3"><div><div class="SearchForm_searchBox__9EPie

Often, that\nis the minimum manifester level necessary to manifest the power. (Randomly\ndiscovered items usually follow this rule.) However, when making such an item,\nthe item’s strength can be set higher than the minimum.
