      <h1>사이오닉 특기</h1>
      <div class="original-headline">PSIONIC FEATS</div>
      <p>
        사이오닉 특기 are available only to characters and creatures with the ability to manifest powers. (In other
        words, they either have a power point reserve or have 유사사이오닉 능력.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Because 사이오닉 특기 are supernatural 능력—a departure from the general rule that 특기 do not grant
        supernatural 능력—they cannot be disrupted in 전투(as powers can be) and generally do not provoke 기회 공격
        (except as noted in their 묘사). Supernatural 능력 are not subject to 파워 저항 and cannot be dispelled;
        however, they do not function in 범위 where 사이오닉 is suppressed, such as a
        <i>무의 사이오닉 장. </i>Leaving such an 범위 immediately allows 사이오닉 특기
        to be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many 사이오닉 특기 can be used only when you are psionically focused; others require you to expend your 사이오닉
        집중 to gain their benefit. Expending your 사이오닉 집중 does not require an action; it is part of another
        action (such as using a feat). When you expend your 사이오닉 집중, it applies only to the action for which you
        expended it.
      </p>

        <h3>사이오닉 아이템 제작 특기</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">PSIONIC ITEM CREATION FEATS</div>
        <p>
          Manifesters can use their personal power to create lasting 사이오닉 아이템. Doing so, however, is draining. A
          manifester must put a little of himself or herself into every psionic item he or she creates.
        </p>
        <p>
          A psionic item creation feat lets a manifester create a psionic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type
          of items they involve, the various 아이템 제작 특기 all have certain features in common.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>XP Cost:</b><span>
            Power and energy that the manifester would normally keep is expended when making a psionic item. 경험치 비용
            of using a psionic item creation feat equals 1/25 the cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot
            spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a 레벨. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new
            레벨, he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance a
            레벨.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Raw Materials Cost:</b><span>
            Creating a psionic item requires costly 구성요소, most of which are consumed in the process. The cost of
            these materials equals 1/2 the cost of the item.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Using a psionic item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or psionic workshop, special tools,
          and other 장비. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply
          (such as if he’s traveling far from home).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Time:</b><span>
            The time to create a psionic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one
            day.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Item Cost:</b><span>
            도르제 제작, 파워스톤 새기기, and 문신 새기기 create items that directly reproduce the effects of powers,
            and 근력 of these items depends on their 구현자 레벨—that is, a power from such an item has 근력 it would
            have if manifested by a manifester of that 레벨. Often, that is the minimum 구현자 레벨 necessary to
            manifest the power. (Randomly discovered items usually follow this rule.) However, when making such an item,
            the item’s 근력 can be set higher than the minimum. Any time a character creates an item using a power
            augmented by spending additional 파워 포인트, the character’s effective 구현자 레벨 for 목적 of calculating
            the item’s cost increases by 1 for each 1 additional power point spent. (Augmentation is a feature of many
            powers that allows the power to be amplified in various ways if additional 파워 포인트 are spent.) All other
            레벨-dependent parameters of the power forged into the item are set according to the effective 구현자
            레벨.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The price of 사이오닉 아이템(and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) depends on 레벨 of the
          power and a character’s 구현자 레벨. The character’s 구현자 레벨 must be high enough that the item creator can
          manifest the power at the chosen 레벨. To find the final price in each case, multiply the character’s 구현자
          레벨 by the power 레벨, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>파워스톤: </i><span>Base price = power 레벨 x 구현자 레벨 x 25 gp</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>사이오닉 문신: </i><span>Base price = power 레벨 x 구현자 레벨 x 50 gp</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>도르제: </i><span>Base price = power 레벨 x 구현자 레벨 x 750 gp</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Extra Costs:</b><span>
            Any dorje, power stone, or psionic tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate
            cost.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          For 사이오닉 문신 and 파워스톤, the creator must pay the XP cost when creating the item. For a dorje, the
          creator must pay fifty times the XP cost.
        </p>
        <p>Some 사이오닉 아이템 similarly incur extra costs in XP, as noted in their 묘사.</p>

        <h3>메타사이오닉 특기</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">METAPSIONIC FEATS</div>
        <p>
          As a manifester’s 지식 of 사이오닉 grows, he can learn to manifest powers in ways slightly different from how
          the powers were originally designed or learned. Of course, manifesting a power while using a metapsionic feat
          is more expensive than manifesting the power normally.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>구현 시간:</b><span>
            Powers manifested using 메타사이오닉 특기 take the same time as manifesting the powers normally unless the
            feat 묘사 specifically says otherwise.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Manifestation Cost:</b><span>
            To use a metapsionic feat, a psionic character must both expend his 사이오닉 집중(see 집중 skill 묘사) and
            pay an increased power point cost as given in the feat 묘사.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Limits on Use:</b><span>
            As with all powers, you cannot spend more 파워 포인트 on a power than your 구현자 레벨. 메타사이오닉 특기
            merely let you manifest powers in different ways; they do not let you violate this rule.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Effects of 메타사이오닉 특기 on a Power:</b><span>
            In all ways, a metapsionic power operates at its original power 레벨, even though it costs additional 파워
            포인트. The modifications to a power made by a metapsionic feat have only their noted effect on the power. A
            manifester can’t use a metapsionic feat to alter a power being cast from a power stone, dorje, or other
            device.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Manifesting a power modified by 빠른 파워 feat does not provoke 기회 공격.</p>
        <p>Some 메타사이오닉 특기 apply only to certain powers, as described in each specific feat entry.</p>
        <p>
          <b>사이오닉 아이템 and Metapsionic Powers:</b><span>
            With the right psionic item creation feat, you can store a metapsionic power in a power stone, psionic
            tattoo, or dorje. 레벨 limits for 사이오닉 문신 apply to the power’s higher metapsionic 레벨.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          A character doesn’t need the appropriate metapsionic feat to activate an item in which a metapsionic power is
          stored, but does need the metapsionic feat to create such an item.

          <p>
            <b>Benefit:</b><span>
              To use this feat, you must expend your 사이오닉 집중. You can attempt to manifest your powers against
              targets that are sheltered behind a wall or force effect. Your power briefly skips through 영적 세계 to
              바이패스 the barrier.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            근력 and thickness of the barrier determine your chance of success. To successfully 바이패스 the barrier
            with your power, you make a 사이크래프트 check against a DC equal to 10 + the hardness of the barrier + 1
            per foot of thickness (minimum 1). Assign a hardness of 20 to barriers without a hardness rating, such as
            force effects (or a <i>심령의 벽</i>). Force 벽 or
            <i>벽 of ectoplasm </i>are assumed to have less than 1 foot of thickness
            unless noted otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a power requires line of sight (which includes most powers that affect a target or targets instead of an
            범위), you cannot manifest it as a 파고드는 권능 unless you can somehow see the target, such as with
            <i>투시 감각</i>. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the
            power by 2. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your 구현자 레벨.

          <p>
            <b>Benefit:</b><span>
              To use this feat, you must expend your 사이오닉 집중. You can chain any power that affects a single target
              and that deals either acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic 피해. After the primary target is struck,
              the power can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your 구현자 레벨(maximum twenty). The
              secondary arcs each strike one target and deal half as much 피해 as the primary one did (round
              down).</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Each target gets to make a 내성 굴림, if one is allowed by the power. You choose secondary targets as you
            like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once.
            You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in 범위, for example).

              To use this feat, you must expend your 사이오닉 집중. You can manifest a power as a delayed power. A

              a creature enters 범위 that the power will affect (only powers that affect 범위 can use this 트리거
              condition); or (3) It activates on your turn after 5 rounds pass. If you choose one of the first two

            affected by the power, including 내성 굴림, are decided when 지연 period ends.
          </p>
          <p>
            A delayed power can be dispelled normally during 지연, and can be detected normally in 범위 or on the target

              지속시간, number of targets, and so on) are the same for both of the resulting powers. The target
              experiences all the effects of both powers individually and receives a 내성 굴림(if applicable) for each.
              In some cases, such as a twinned <i>psionic charm</i>, failing both 내성
              굴림 results in redundant effects (although, in this example, any ally of the target would have to succeed

              While you are psionically focused, you can take part of one of your 이동 행동 to traverse a wall or other
              relatively smooth vertical surface if you begin and end your 이동 on a horizontal surface. The height you
              can achieve on the wall is limited only by this 이동 restriction. If you do not end your 이동 on a
              horizontal surface, you fall prone, taking 낙하 피해 as appropriate for your distance above the ground.
              Treat the wall as a normal floor for 목적 of measuring your 이동. Passing from floor to wall or wall to
              floor costs no 이동; you can change surfaces freely. Opponents on the ground can make 기회 공격 as you
              이동 up the wall.</span>

          <p>
            <b>Special:</b><span>
              You can take other 이동 행동 in conjunction with moving along a wall. For instance, 탄성 공격 feat allows
              you to make an 공격 from the wall against a foe standing on the ground who is within 범위 you threaten;
              however, if you are somehow prevented from completing your 이동, you fall. Likewise, you could 재주넘기
              along the wall to avoid 기회 공격.</span>

              To use this feat, you must expend your 사이오닉 집중. You can alter a 폭발, emanation, line, or
              spread-shaped power to increase its 범위. (Powers that do not have an 범위 of one of these four sorts are
              not affected by this feat.) Any numeric measurements of the power’s 범위 increase by 100%.</span>

            Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 4. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your

However, when making such an item,\n            the item’s 근력 can be set higher than the minimum. Any time a character creates an item using a power\n            augmented by spending additional 파워 포인트, the character’s effective 구현자 레벨 for 목적 of calculating\n            the item’s cost increases by 1 for each 1 additional power point spent. (Augmentation is a feature of many\n            powers that allows the power to be amplified in various ways if additional 파워 포인트 are spent.)
