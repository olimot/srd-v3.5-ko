If a character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him or her stable. A stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them.</p><p><em title="Long-Term Care:">장기 치료:</em> Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful, the patient recovers hit points or ability score points (lost to ability damage) at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of complete rest.</p><p>You can tend as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself.</p><p><em title="Treat Wound from Caltrop, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones:">마름쇠, 가시 성장, 가시 암석에 생긴 상처 치료:</em> A creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at one-half normal speed. A successful Heal check removes this movement penalty.</p><p>A creature wounded by a <i>spike growth</i> or <i>spike stones</i> spell must succeed on a Reflex save or take injuries that reduce his speed by one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the victim’s injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell’s save DC.</p><p><em title="Treat Poison:">독 치료:</em> To treat poison means to tend a single character who has been poisoned and who is going to take more damage from the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a saving throw against the poison, you make a Heal check. The poisoned character uses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher.</p><p><em title="Treat Disease:">질병 치료:</em> To treat a disease means to tend a single diseased character. Every time he or she makes a saving throw against disease effects, you make a Heal check. The diseased character uses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher.</p><p><strong title="Action:">행동:</strong> Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a creature wounded by a <i>spike growth</i> or <i>spike stones</i> spell takes 10 minutes of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity.</p><p><strong title="Try Again:">다시 시도하기:</strong> Varies. Generally speaking, you can’t try a Heal check again without proof of the original check’s failure. You can always retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the previous attempt is still alive.</p><p><strong title="Special:">특수:</strong> A character with the Self-Sufficient feat gets a +2 bonus on Heal checks.</p><p>A healer’s kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks.</p></section><section id="h2-2-hide-dex-armor-check-penalty"><h2 title="HIDE (DEX; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)">숨기 <small>(민; 갑옷 판정 페널티)</small></h2><p><strong title="Check:">판정:</strong> Your Hide check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone who might see you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed and hide at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than your normal speed, you take a –5 penalty. It’s practically impossible (–20 penalty) to hide while attacking, running or charging.</p><p>A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on Hide checks depending on its size category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large –4, Huge –8, Gargantuan –12, Colossal –16.</p><p>You need cover or concealment in order to attempt a Hide check. Total cover or total concealment usually (but not always; see Special, below) obviates the need for a Hide check, since nothing can see you anyway.</p><p>If people are observing you, even casually, you can’t hide. You can run around a corner or behind cover so that you’re out of sight and then hide, but the others then know at least where you went.</p><p>If your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a Bluff check; see below), though, you can attempt to hide. While the others turn their attention from you, you can attempt a Hide check if you can get to a hiding place of some kind. (As a general guideline, the hiding place has to be within 1 foot per rank you have in Hide.) This check, however, is made at a –10 penalty because you have to move fast.</p><p><em title="Sniping:">저격:</em> If you’ve already successfully hidden at least 10 feet from your target, you can make one ranged attack, then immediately hide again. You take a –20 penalty on your Hide check to conceal yourself after the shot.</p><p><em title="Creating a Diversion to Hide:">숨기 위해 주의 돌리기:</em> You can use Bluff to help you hide. A successful Bluff check can give you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you.</p><p><strong title="Action:">행동:</strong> Usually none. Normally, you make a Hide check as part of movement, so it doesn’t take a separate action. However, hiding immediately after a ranged attack (see Sniping, above) is a move action.</p><p><strong title="Special:">특수:</strong> If you are invisible, you gain a +40 bonus on Hide checks if you are immobile, or a +20 bonus on Hide checks if you’re moving.</p><p>If you have the Stealthy feat, you get a +2 bonus on Hide checks.</p><p>A 13th-level ranger can attempt a Hide check in any sort of natural terrain, even if it doesn’t grant cover or concealment. A 17thlevel ranger can do this even while being observed.</p></section><section id="h2-3-intimidate-cha"><h2 title="INTIMIDATE (CHA)">위협 <small>(매)</small></h2><p><strong title="Check:">판정:</strong> You can change another’s behavior with a successful check. Your Intimidate check is opposed by the target’s modified level check (1d20 + character level or Hit Dice + target’s Wisdom bonus [if any] + target’s modifiers on saves against fear). If you beat your target’s check result, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains intimidated. (That is, the target retains its normal attitude, but will chat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while intimidated. See the Diplomacy skill, above, for additional details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains in your presence, and for 1d6×10 minutes afterward. After this time, the target’s default attitude toward you shifts to unfriendly (or, if normally unfriendly, to hostile).</p><p>If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target provides you with incorrect or useless information, or otherwise frustrates your efforts.</p><p><em title="Demoralize Opponent:">상대방 사기저하:</em> You can also use Intimidate to weaken an opponent’s resolve in combat. To do so, make an Intimidate check opposed by the target’s modified level check (see above). If you win, the target becomes shaken for 1 round. A shaken character takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. You can intimidate only an opponent that you threaten in melee combat and that can see you.</p><p><strong title="Action:">행동:</strong> Varies. Changing another’s behavior requires 1 minute of interaction. Intimidating an opponent in combat is a standard action.</p><p><strong title="Try Again:">다시 시도하기:</strong> Optional, but not recommended because retries usually do not work. Even if the initial check succeeds, the other character can be intimidated only so far, and a retry doesn’t help. If the initial check fails, the other character has probably become more firmly resolved to resist the intimidator, and a retry is futile.</p><p><strong title="Special:">특수:</strong> You gain a +4 bonus on your Intimidate check for every size category that you are larger than your target. Conversely, you take a –4 penalty on your Intimidate check for every size category that you are smaller than your target.</p><p>A character immune to fear can’t be intimidated, nor can nonintelligent creatures.</p><p>If you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.</p><p><strong title="Synergy:">시너지:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.</p></section><section id="h2-4-jump-str-armor-check-penalty"><h2 title="JUMP (STR; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)">도약 <small>(근; 갑옷 판정 페널티)</small></h2><p><strong title="Check:">판정:</strong> The DC and the distance you can cover vary according to the type of jump you are attempting (see below).</p><p>Your Jump check is modified by your speed. If your speed is 30 feet then no modifier based on speed applies to the check. If your speed is less than 30 feet, you take a –6 penalty for every 10 feet of speed less than 30 feet. If your speed is greater than 30 feet, you gain a +4 bonus for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet.</p><p>All Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start, which requires that you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before attempting the jump. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the jump is doubled.</p><p>Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal maximum movement in a round.</p><p>If you have ranks in Jump and you succeed on a Jump check, you land on your feet (when appropriate). If you attempt a Jump check untrained, you land prone unless you beat the DC by 5 or more.</p><p><em title="Long Jump:">먼 도약:</em> A long jump is a horizontal jump, made across a gap like a chasm or stream. At the midpoint of the jump, you attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal distance. The DC for the jump is equal to the distance jumped (in feet).</p><p>If your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end. If you fail the check by less than 5, you don’t clear the distance, but you can make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the far edge of the gap. You end your movement grasping the far edge. If that leaves you dangling over a chasm or gap, getting up requires a move action and a DC 15 Climb check.</p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><th title="Long Jump Distance">먼 도약 거리</th><th style="min-width: 7.725em;" title="Jump DC1">도약 DC<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></th></tr><tr><td>5 feet</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>10 feet</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>15 feet</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>20 feet</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>25 feet</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>30 feet</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">1 Requires a 20-foot running start.

The DC is equal to 4 times the distance to be cleared.</p><p>If you jumped up to grab something, a successful check indicates that you reached the desired height. If you wish to pull yourself up, you can do so with a move action and a DC 15 Climb check. If you fail the Jump check, you do not reach the height, and you land on your feet in the same spot from which you jumped.

Doing so counts as 10 feet of movement, so if your speed is 30 feet, you could move 20 feet, then hop up onto a counter. You do not need to get a running start to hop up, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.</p><p><em title="Jumping Down:">아래로 도약:</em> If you intentionally jump from a height, you take less damage than you would if you just fell. The DC to jump down from a height is 15. You do not have to get a running start to jump down, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.</p><p>If you succeed on the check, you take falling damage as if you had dropped 10 fewer feet than you actually did.</p><p><strong title="Action:">행동:</strong> None. A Jump check is included in your movement, so it is part of a move action.

(That is, the target retains its normal attitude, but will chat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while intimidated. See the Diplomacy skill, above, for additional details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains in your presence, and for 1d6×10 minutes afterward.
