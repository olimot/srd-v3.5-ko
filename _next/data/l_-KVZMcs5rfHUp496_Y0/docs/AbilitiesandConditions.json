A character’s\nability score can’t drop below 0.</p><p>Having\na score of 0 in an ability is different from having no ability score\nwhatsoever.</p><p>Some\n주문 or 능력 impose an effective ability score reduction, which is\ndifferent from 능력 점수 손실. Any such reduction disappears at the end of\nthe spell’s or ability’s 지속시간, and the ability score immediately returns to\nits former value.</p><p>If\na character’s 건강 score drops, then he loses 1 hit point per Hit Die\nfor every point by which his 건강 modifier drops. A hit point score\ncan’t be reduced by 건강 피해 or drain to less than 1 hit point per\nHit Die.</p><p>The\nability that some creatures have to drain 능력 점수 is a supernatural one,\nrequiring some sort of 공격.

Once a magical effect is no\nlonger affected by the 항마 (the 항마 fades, the center of the effect\n이동 away, and so on), the magic returns. 주문 that still have part of their\n지속시간 left begin functioning again, 마법 아이템 are once again useful, and\nso forth.</p><p>•\nSpell areas that include both an 항마 area and a normal area, but are not\ncentered in the 항마 area, still function in the normal area. If the\nspell’s center is in the 항마 area, then the spell is suppressed.</p><p>•\n골렘 and other constructs, 정령, outsiders, and corporeal undead, still\nfunction in an 항마 area (though the 항마 area suppresses their\nspellcasting and their supernatural and spell-like 능력 normally). If such\ncreatures are summoned or conjured, however, see below. </p><p>•\nSummoned or conjured creatures of any type, as well as incorporeal undead, wink\nout if they enter the area of an 항마 effect. They reappear in the same\n감지 once the field goes away.</p><p>•\n마법 아이템 with continuous effectsdo not function in the area of an\n항마 effect, but their effects are not canceled (so the contents of a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">bag\nof holding</span> are unavailable, but neither spill out nor disappear forever).</p><p>•\nTwo 항마 areas in the same place do not cancel each other out, nor do they\nstack.</p><p>•\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">힘의 장벽, 무지갯빛 벽, </span>and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">무지갯빛의 구 </span>are not\naffected by 항마. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">마력부여술 파괴, 마법 무효화, </span>and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">상급\n마법 무효화 </span>주문 do not dispel 항마. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">마법사의 분열 </span>has\na 1% chance per 시전자 레벨 of destroying an <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">대마법 보호장. </span>If the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">대마법 보호장 </span>survives the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">disjunction, </span>no items within it are disjoined.</p></section><section id=\"h3-4-blindsight-and-blindsense\"><h3>시각 차단 및 감각 차단</h3><div class=\"original-headline\">BLINDSIGHT AND\nBLINDSENSE</div><p>Some\ncreatures have blindsight, the extraordinary ability to use a nonvisual sense\n(or a combination of such senses) to operate effectively without 시야. Such\nsense may include sensitivity to vibrations, acute 냄새, keen hearing, or\necholocation. This ability makes 투명화 and 은폐 (even magical\n암흑) irrelevant to the creature (though it still can’t see ethereal\ncreatures). This ability operates out to a 범위 specified in the creature\n묘사.</p><p>•\nBlindsight never allows a creature to distinguish color or visual contrast. A\ncreature cannot read with blindsight.</p><p>•\nBlindsight does not subject a creature to 시선 공격 (even though 암흑시야\ndoes).</p><p>•\nBlinding 공격 do not penalize creatures using blindsight. </p><p>•\nDeafening 공격 thwart blindsight if it relies on hearing.</p><p>•\nBlindsight works underwater but not in a vacuum.</p><p>•\nBlindsight negates 변위 and 흐릿함 effects.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Blindsense:</span><span> Other creatures have\nblindsense, a 하급 ability that lets the creature notice things it cannot\nsee, but without the precision of blindsight. The creature with blindsense\nusually does not need to make 감지 or 듣기 checks to notice and 생명체 위치파악 within 범위 of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of\neffect to that creature. Any opponent the creature cannot see has total\n은폐 (50% miss chance) against the creature with blindsense, and the\nblindsensing creature still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that\nhave 은폐. Visibility still affects the 이동 of a creature with\nblindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its 민첩 bonus to\n방어도 against 공격 from creatures it cannot see.</span></p></section><section id=\"h3-5-breath-weapon\"><h3>브레스 무기</h3><div class=\"original-headline\">BREATH WEAPON</div><p>A\ncreature attacking with a 브레스 무기 is actually expelling something from\nits mouth (rather than conjuring it by means of a spell or some other magical\neffect). Most creatures with 브레스 무기 are limited to a number of uses per\nday or by a minimum length of time that must pass between uses. Such creatures\nare usually smart enough to save their 브레스 무기 until they really need it.</p><p>•\nUsing a 브레스 무기 is typically a standard action.</p><p>•\nNo 명중 굴림 is necessary. The breath simply fills its stated area.</p><p>•\nAny character caught in the area must make the appropriate 내성 굴림 or\nsuffer the 브레스 무기’s full effect. In many cases, a character who succeeds\non his 내성 굴림 still takes half 피해 or some other reduced effect.</p><p>•\n브레스 무기 are supernatural 능력 except where noted.</p><p>•\nCreatures are immune to their own 브레스 무기.</p><p>•\nCreatures unable to breathe can still use 브레스 무기.

Two general types of\n마력부여술 affect characters and creatures: charms and compulsions.</p><p>Charming\nanother creature gives the charming character the ability to befriend and\nsuggest courses of actions to his minion, but the servitude is not absolute or\nmindless. Charms of this type include the various <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charm </span>주문. Essentially,\na <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charmed </span>character retains free will but makes choices according to a\nskewed view of the world.</p><p>•\nA <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charmed </span>creature doesn’t gain any magical ability to understand his\nnew friend’s language.</p><p>•\nA <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charmed </span>character retains his original 성향 and allegiances,\ngenerally with the exception that he now regards the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charming </span>creature\nas a dear friend and will give great weight to his 제안 and directions.</p><p>•\nA <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charmed </span>character fights his former allies only if they threaten his\nnew friend, and even then he uses the least lethal means at his disposal as\nlong as these tactics show any possibility of success (just as he would in a\nfight between two actual friends).</p><p>•\nA <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charmed </span>character is entitled to an opposed 매력 check against his\nmaster in order to resist instructions or 명령 that would make him do\nsomething he wouldn’t normally do even for a close friend. If he succeeds, he\ndecides not to go along with that order but remains <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charmed.</span></p><p>•\nA <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charmed </span>character never obeys a 명령 that is obviously suicidal or\ngrievously harmful to her.</p><p>•\nIf the charming creature 명령 his minion to do something that the\ninfluenced character would be violently opposed to, the subject may attempt a\nnew 내성 굴림 to break free of the influence altogether.</p><p>•\nA <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charmed </span>character who is openly attacked by the creature who <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charmed\n</span>him or by that creature’s apparent allies is automatically freed of the\nspell or effect.</p><p>Compulsion\nis a different matter altogether. A compulsion overrides the subject’s free will\nin some way or simply changes the way the subject’s mind works. A charm makes\nthe subject a friend of the caster; a compulsion makes the subject obey the\ncaster.</p><p>Regardless\nof whether a character is charmed or compelled, he won’t volunteer information\nor tactics that his master doesn’t ask for.</p></section><section id=\"h3-7-cold-immunity\"><h3>냉기 내성</h3><div class=\"original-headline\">COLD IMMUNITY</div><p>A\ncreature with 냉기 내성 never takes cold 피해.

Usually, a certain type of weapon can\novercome this reduction. This information is separated from the 피해 축소 number by a slash. 피해 축소 may be overcome by 특수 재료, by 마법 무기 (any weapon with a +1 or higher enhancement bonus,\nnot counting the enhancement from masterwork quality), certain types of 무기\n(such as slashing or bludgeoning), and 무기 imbued with an 성향. If a\ndash follows the slash then the 피해 축소 is effective against any 공격\nthat does not ignore 피해 축소.</p><p>Ammunition\nfired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is\ntreated as a 마법 무기 for the 목적 of overcoming 피해 축소.\nSimilarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an 성향 gains\nthe 성향 of that projectile weapon (in addition to any 성향 it may\nalready have).</p><p>Whenever\n피해 축소 completely negates the 피해 from an 공격, it also negates\nmost special effects that accompany the 공격, such as injury type 독, a\n수도사’s stunning, and injury type 질병. 피해 축소 does not negate\ntouch 공격, energy 피해 dealt along with an 공격, or 정령 흡수. Nor\ndoes it affect 독 or 질병 delivered by inhalation, ingestion, or\ncontact. </p><p>공격\nthat deal no 피해 because of the target’s 피해 축소 do not disrupt\n주문.</p><p>주문,\nspell-like 능력, and energy 공격 (even nonmagical fire) ignore 피해 축소.</p><p>Sometimes\n피해 축소 is instant 치료. Sometimes 피해 축소 represents the\ncreature’s tough 숨기 or body,. In either case, characters can see that\nconventional 공격 don’t work.</p><p>If\na creature has 피해 축소 from more than one source, the two forms of\n피해 축소 do not stack.

It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not\nsee otherwise—invisible objects are still invisible, and 환상 are still\nvisible as what they seem to be. Likewise, 암흑시야 subjects a creature to\n시선 공격 normally.

A 듣기 check that beats the DC by 20 pinpoints the\ninvisible creature’s location.</p><div class=\"table-container\"><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 30.1501em;\"><tbody style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"><tr style=\"break-inside: avoid; vertical-align: middle;\"><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;\">듣기\n  Check DCs to Detect Invisible Creatures</td></tr><tr style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"><td style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;\">Invisible\n  Creature Is . . . </td><td style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;\">DC</td></tr><tr style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"><td style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;\">In\n  전투 or speaking</td><td style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;\">0</td></tr><tr style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"><td style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;\">Moving\n  at half 속도</td><td style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;\">조용히 이동 check result</td></tr><tr style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"><td style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;\">Moving\n  at full 속도</td><td style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;\">조용히 이동 check result –4</td></tr><tr style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"><td style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;\">Running\n  or charging</td><td style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;\">조용히 이동 check result –20</td></tr><tr style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"><td style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;\">Some\n  distance away</td><td style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;\">+1\n  per 10 feet</td></tr><tr style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"><td style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;\">Behind\n  an obstacle (door)</td><td style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;\">+5</td></tr><tr style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"><td style=\"border: none; vertical-align: top;\">Behind\n  an obstacle (stone wall)</td><td style=\"border: none; vertical-align: top;\">+15</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>A\ncreature can grope about to find an invisible creature. A character can make a\ntouch 공격 with his hands or a weapon into two adjacent 5-foot squares using\na standard action. If an invisible target is in the designated area, there is a\n50% miss chance on the touch 공격. If successful, the groping character deals\nno 피해 but has successfully pinpointed the invisible creature’s current\nlocation. (If the invisible creature 이동, its location, obviously, is once\nagain unknown.)</p><p>If\nan invisible creature strikes a character, the character struck still knows the\nlocation of the creature that struck him (until, of course, the invisible\ncreature 이동). The only exception is if the invisible creature has a reach\n상급 than 5 feet. In this case, the struck character knows the general\nlocation of the creature but has not pinpointed the exact location.</p><p>If\na character tries to 공격 an invisible creature whose location he has\npinpointed, he 공격 normally, but the invisible creature still benefits from\nfull 은폐 (and thus a 50% miss chance). A particularly large and 감속화\ncreature might get a smaller miss chance.</p><p>If\na character tries to 공격 an invisible creature whose location he has not\npinpointed, have the player choose the space where the character will direct\nthe 공격. If the invisible creature is there, conduct the 공격 normally. If\nthe enemy’s not there, roll the miss chance as if it were there, don’t let the\nplayer see the result, and tell him that the character has missed. That way the\nplayer doesn’t know whether the 공격 missed because the enemy’s not there or\nbecause you successfully rolled the miss chance.</p><p>If\nan invisible character picks up a visible object, the object remains visible.\nOne could coat an invisible object with flour to at least keep 추적 of its\nposition (until the flour fell off or blew away). An invisible creature can\npick up a small visible item and 숨기 it on his person (tucked in a pocket or\nbehind a cloak) and render it effectively invisible. </p><p>Invisible\ncreatures leave 추적. They can be tracked normally. Footprints in sand, mud,\nor other soft surfaces can give enemies clues to an invisible creature’s\nlocation.</p><p>An\ninvisible creature in the water displaces water, revealing its location.

If he fails, he takes the\n독’s initial 피해 (usually ability 피해). Even if he succeeds, he\ntypically faces more 피해 1 minute later, which he can also avoid with a\nsuccessful Fortitude 내성 굴림.</p><p>One\ndose of 독 smeared on a weapon or some other object affects just a single\ntarget. A poisoned weapon or object retains its venom until the weapon scores a\nhit or the object is touched (unless the 독 is wiped off before a target\ncomes in contact with it). Any 독 smeared on an object or exposed to the\nelements in any way remains potent until it is touched or used.</p><p>Although\nsupernatural and spell-like 독 are possible, poisonous effects are almost\nalways extraordinary.</p><p>독\ncan be divided into four basic types according to the method by which their\neffect is delivered, as follows.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Contact:</span><span> Merely touching this type\nof 독 necessitates a 내성 굴림. It can be actively delivered via a\nweapon or a touch 공격. Even if a creature has sufficient 피해 축소 to\navoid taking any 피해 from the 공격, the 독 can still affect it. A\nchest or other object can be smeared with contact 독 as part of a trap.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Ingested:</span><span> Ingested 독 are\nvirtually impossible to utilize in a 전투 situation. A poisoner could\nadminister a potion to an unconscious creature or attempt to dupe someone into\ndrinking or eating something poisoned. 암살자 and other characters tend to\nuse ingested 독 outside of 전투.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Inhaled:</span><span> Inhaled 독 are\nusually contained in fragile vials or eggshells. They can be thrown as a ranged\n공격 with a 범위 increment of 10 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is\nstruck hard), the container releases its 독. One dose spreads to fill the\nvolume of a 10-foot cube. Each creature within the area must make a 내성 굴림. (Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled 독; they\naffect the nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.)</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Injury:</span><span> This 독 must be\ndelivered through a wound. If a creature has sufficient 피해 축소 to\navoid taking any 피해 from the 공격, the 독 does not affect it. 함정\nthat cause 피해 from 무기, needles, and the like sometimes contain injury\n독.</span></p><p>The\ncharacteristics of 독 are summarized on Table: 독. Terms on the table\nare defined below.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Type:\n</span><span>The\n독’s method of delivery (contact, ingested, inhaled, or via an injury) and\nthe Fortitude save DC to avoid the 독’s 피해.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Initial\n피해: </span><span>The\n피해 the character takes immediately upon failing his 내성 굴림 against\nthis 독. Ability 피해 is temporary unless marked with an asterisk (*), in\nwhich case the loss is a permanent drain. 마비 lasts for 2d6 minutes.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Secondary\n피해: </span><span>The\namount of 피해 the character takes 1 minute after exposure as a result of the\npoisoning, if he fails a second 내성 굴림. Unconsciousness lasts for 1d3\nhours. Ability 피해 marked with an asterisk is permanent drain instead of\ntemporary 피해.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Price:\n</span><span>The cost\nof one dose (one vial) of the 독. It is not possible to use or apply 독\nin any quantity smaller than one dose. The purchase and possession of 독 is\nalways illegal, and even in big cities it can be obtained only from\nspecialized, less than reputable sources.</span></p><section id=\"h4-28-perils-of-using-poison\"><h4>독 사용의 위험성</h4><div class=\"original-headline\">Perils of Using Poison</div><p>A\ncharacter has a 5% chance of exposing himself to a 독 whenever he applies\nit to a weapon or otherwise readies it for use.

Polymorphed creatures retain\ntheir own minds but have new physical forms.</p><p>The\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">변이 </span>spell defines the general 변이 effect.</p><p>Since\ncreatures do not change types, a slaying or 파멸 weapon designed to kill or\n해악 creatures of a specific type affects those creatures even if they are\npolymorphed. Likewise, a creature polymorphed into the form of a creature of a\ndifferent type is not subject to slaying and 파멸 effects directed at that type\nof creature. </p><p>A\n레인저’s favored enemy bonus is based on knowing what the foe is, so if a\ncreature that is a 레인저’s favored enemy 변이 into another form, the\n레인저 is denied his bonus.</p><p>A\n드워프 ’s bonus for fighting 거인 is based on shape and size, so he does not\ngain a bonus against a 거인 polymorphed into something else, but does gain the\nbonus against any creature polymorphed into a 거인.</p></section><section id=\"h3-31-psionics\"><h3>사이오닉</h3><div class=\"original-headline\">PSIONICS</div><p>정신감응,\nmental 전투 and psychic powers—사이오닉 is a catchall word that describes\nspecial mental 능력 possessed by various creatures.

Each psionic creature’s 묘사\ncontains details on its psionic 능력.</p><p>Psionic\n공격 almost always allow Will 내성 굴림 to resist them. However, not all\npsionic 공격 are mental 공격. Some psionic 능력 allow the psionic\ncreature to reshape its own body, 치료 its wounds, or 순간이동 great distances.\nSome 사이오닉 생명체 can see into the future, the past, and the present (in\nfar-off locales) as well as read the minds of others. </p></section><section id=\"h3-32-rays\"><h3>광선</h3><div class=\"original-headline\">RAYS</div><p>All\nray 공격 require the attacker to make a successful ranged touch 공격\nagainst the target. 광선 have varying 범위, which are simple maximums. A ray’s\n명중 굴림 never takes a 범위 penalty. Even if a ray hits, it usually allows\nthe target to make a 내성 굴림 (Fortitude or Will). 광선 never allow a\nReflex 내성 굴림, but if a character’s 민첩 bonus to AC is high, it\nmight be hard to hit her with the ray in the first place.</p></section><section id=\"h3-33-regeneration\"><h3>재생</h3><div class=\"original-headline\">REGENERATION</div><p>Creatures\nwith this extraordinary ability recover from wounds quickly and can even regrow\nor reattach severed body parts. 피해 dealt to the creature is treated as\n비치명적인 피해, and the creature automatically cures itself of 비치명적인 피해 at a fixed rate.</p><p>Certain\n공격 forms, typically fire and acid, deal 피해 to the creature normally;\nthat sort of 피해 doesn’t convert to 비치명적인 피해 and so doesn’t go away.\nThe creature’s 묘사 includes the details.</p><p>Creatures\nwith 재생 can regrow lost portions of their bodies and can reattach\nsevered limbs or body parts.

If the opponent is upwind, the 범위 is 60 feet. If\nit is downwind, the 범위 is 15 feet. Strong 냄새, such as smoke or rotting\ngarbage, can be detected at twice the 범위 noted above. Overpowering 냄새,\nsuch as skunk musk or 트로글로다이트 stench, can be detected at three times these\n범위.</p><p>The\ncreature detects another creature’s presence but not its specific location.\nNoting the direction of the 냄새 is a 이동 action. If it 이동 within 5 feet\nof the 냄새’s source, the creature can pinpoint that source.</p><p>A\ncreature with the 추적 feat and the 냄새 ability can follow 추적 by smell,\nmaking a 지혜 check to find or follow a 추적. The typical DC for a fresh\ntrail is 10. The DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s\nodor is, the number of creatures, and the 나이 of the trail. For each hour that\nthe trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the\nrules for the 추적 feat. Creatures tracking by 냄새 ignore the effects of\nsurface 상태이상 and poor visibility.</p><p>Creatures\nwith the 냄새 ability can 식별 familiar odors just as 인간 do familiar\nsights.</p><p>Water,\nparticularly running water, 파멸 a trail for air-breathing creatures.\nWater-breathing creatures that have the 냄새 ability, however, can use it in\nthe water easily.</p><p>False,\npowerful odors can easily mask other 냄새.

(The defender’s 주문 저항 is like an 방어도 against\nmagical 공격.) If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn’t affect the\ncreature. The possessor does not have to do anything special to use 주문 저항. The creature need not even be aware of the threat for its 주문 저항 to operate.</p><p>Only\n주문 and spell-like 능력 are subject to 주문 저항. Extraordinary\nand supernatural 능력 (including enhancement bonuses on 마법 무기) are\nnot. A creature can have some 능력 that are subject to 주문 저항\nand some that are not. Even some 주문 ignore 주문 저항; see 주문 저항이 적용되는 조건, below. </p><p>A\ncreature can voluntarily lower its 주문 저항. Doing so is a standard\naction that does not provoke an 공격 of opportunity. Once a creature lowers\nits 저항, it remains down until the creature’s next turn. At the\nbeginning of the creature’s next turn, the creature’s 주문 저항\nautomatically returns unless the creature intentionally keeps it down (also a\nstandard action that does not provoke an 공격 of opportunity).</p><p>A\ncreature’s 주문 저항 never interferes with its own 주문, items, or\n능력.</p><p>A\ncreature with 주문 저항 cannot impart this power to others by touching\nthem or standing in their midst. Only the rarest of creatures and a few 마법 아이템 have the ability to bestow 주문 저항 upon another.</p><p>주문 저항 does not stack. It overlaps. </p><section id=\"h4-37-when-spell-resistance-applies\"><h4>주문 저항이 적용되는 조건</h4><div class=\"original-headline\">When Spell Resistance Applies</div><p>Each spell\nincludes an entry that indicates whether 주문 저항 applies to the spell.\nIn general, whether 주문 저항 applies depends on what the spell does:</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Targeted\n주문:</span><span>\n주문 저항 applies if the spell is targeted at the creature. Some\nindividually targeted 주문 can be directed at several creatures\nsimultaneously. In such cases, a creature’s 주문 저항 applies only to\nthe portion of the spell actually targeted at that creature. If several\ndifferent resistant creatures are subjected to such a spell, each checks its\n주문 저항 separately.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Area\n주문:</span><span>\n주문 저항 applies if the resistant creature is within the spell’s area.\nIt protects the resistant creature without affecting the spell itself.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Effect\n주문:</span><span>\nMost effect 주문 summon or create something and are not subject to 주문 저항. Sometimes, however, 주문 저항 applies to effect 주문,\nusually to those that act upon a creature more or less directly, such as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">거미줄.</span></span></p><p>주문 저항 can protect a creature from a spell that’s already been cast. Check\n주문 저항 when the creature is first affected by the spell.</p><p>Check\n주문 저항 only once for any particular casting of a spell or use of a\nspell-like ability. If 주문 저항 fails the first time, it fails each\ntime the creature encounters that same casting of the spell. Likewise, if the\n주문 저항 succeeds the first time, it always succeeds. If the creature\nhas voluntarily lowered its 주문 저항 and is then subjected to a spell,\nthe creature still has a single chance to resist that spell later, when its\n주문 저항 is up.</p><p>주문 저항 has no effect unless the energy created or released by the spell\nactually goes to work on the resistant creature’s mind or body.

Some 변환 make objects harmful (or more\nharmful), such as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">마법의 돌</span>.

Lost points\nreturn at a rate of 1 per day unless noted otherwise by the condition dealing\nthe 피해. A character with 근력 0 falls to the ground and is helpless. A\ncharacter with 민첩 0 is paralyzed. A character with 건강 0 is\n죽음. A character with 지능, 지혜, or 매력 0 is unconscious.\nAbility 피해 is different from penalties to 능력 점수, which go away\nwhen the 상태이상 causing them go away.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Ability\nDrained:</span><span>\nThe character has permanently lost 1 or more ability score points. The\ncharacter can regain these points only through magical means. A character with\n근력 0 falls to the ground and is helpless. A character with 민첩 0 is\nparalyzed. A character with 건강 0 is 죽음. A character with\n지능, 지혜, or 매력 0 is unconscious. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Blinded:</span><span> The character cannot see.\nHe takes a –2 penalty to 방어도, loses his 민첩 bonus to AC (if any),\n이동 at half 속도, and takes a –4 penalty on 탐색 checks and on most\n근력- and 민첩-based 스킬 판정. All checks and activities that rely\non 시야 (such as reading and 감지 checks) automatically fail. All opponents\nare considered to have total 은폐 (50% miss chance) to the blinded\ncharacter. Characters who remain blinded for a long time grow accustomed to\nthese drawbacks and can overcome some of them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Blown\nAway:</span><span>\nDepending on its size, a creature can be blown away by 바람 of high velocity. A\ncreature on the ground that is blown away is knocked down and rolls 1d4 x 10\nfeet, taking 1d4 points of 비치명적인 피해 per 10 feet. A flying creature that\nis blown away is blown back 2d6 x 10 feet and takes 2d6 points of 비치명적인 피해 due to battering and buffering. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Checked:</span><span> Prevented from achieving\nforward motion by an applied force, such as wind. Checked creatures on the\nground merely stop. Checked flying creatures 이동 back a distance specified in\nthe 묘사 of the effect.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: 700;\">Confused:</span><span>A <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">confused </span>character’s\nactions are determined by rolling d% at the beginning of his turn: 01–10,\n공격 caster with melee or ranged 무기 (or close with caster if attacking\nis not possible); 11–20, act normally; 21–50, do nothing but babble\nincoherently; 51–70, flee away from caster at top possible 속도; 71–100,\n공격 nearest creature (for this 목적, a familiar counts as part of the\nsubject’s self ). A <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">confused </span>character who can’t carry out the indicated\naction does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special\nadvantage when attacking a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">confused </span>character. Any <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">confused </span>character\nwho is attacked automatically 공격 its attackers on its next turn, as long\nas it is still <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">confused </span>when its turn comes. A <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">confused </span>character\ndoes not make 기회 공격 against any creature that it is not\nalready devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or\nbecause it has just been attacked).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Cowering:\n</span><span>The\ncharacter is frozen in 공포 and can take no actions.

The character’s soul leaves his body.\n죽음 characters cannot benefit from normal or magical 치료, but they can be\nrestored to life via magic. A 죽음 body decays normally unless magically\npreserved, but magic that restores a 죽음 character to life also restores the\nbody either to full health or to its condition at the time of death (depending\non the spell or device). Either way, resurrected characters need not worry\nabout rigor mortis, decomposition, and other 상태이상 that affect 죽음\nbodies.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Deafened:</span><span> A deafened character\ncannot hear. She takes a –4 penalty on 선제권 checks, automatically fails\n듣기 checks, and has a 20% chance of 주문 실패 when 주문 시전하기 with\nverbal 구성요소. Characters who remain deafened for a long time grow\naccustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">행동 불능:</span><span> A character with 0 히트 포인트, or one who has negative 히트 포인트 but has become stable and conscious,\nis 행동 불능. A 행동 불능 character may take a single 이동 action or standard\naction each round (but not both, nor can she take 전체 라운드 행동). She\n이동 at half 속도. Taking 이동 행동 doesn’t risk further injury, but\nperforming any standard action (or any other action the DM deems strenuous,\nincluding some 자유 행동 such as casting a quickened spell) deals 1 point of\n피해 after the completion of the act. Unless the action increased the\n행동 불능 character’s 히트 포인트, she is now in negative 히트 포인트 and 죽어가고 있음.</span></p><p>A\n행동 불능 character with negative 히트 포인트 recovers 히트 포인트 naturally if\nshe is being helped. Otherwise, each day she has a 10% chance to start\nrecovering 히트 포인트 naturally (starting with that day); otherwise, she loses\n1 hit point. Once an unaided character starts recovering 히트 포인트 naturally,\nshe is no longer in danger of losing 히트 포인트 (even if her current 히트 포인트\nare negative).</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">죽어가고 있음:</span><span> A 죽어가고 있음 character is\nunconscious and near death. She has –1 to –9 current 히트 포인트. A 죽어가고 있음\ncharacter can take no actions and is unconscious. At the end of each round\n(starting with the round in which the character dropped below 0 히트 포인트),\nthe character rolls d% to see whether she becomes stable. She has a 10% chance\nto become stable. If she does not, she loses 1 hit point. If a 죽어가고 있음 character\nreaches –10 히트 포인트, she is 죽음.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Energy\nDrained:</span><span>\nThe character gains one or more negative 레벨, which might permanently drain\nthe character’s 레벨. If the subject has at least as many negative 레벨 as\n히트 다이스, he dies. Each negative 레벨 gives a creature the following\npenalties: –1 penalty on 명중 굴림, 내성 굴림, 스킬 판정, 능력 판정; loss of 5 히트 포인트; and –1 to effective 레벨 (for determining the\npower, 지속시간, DC, and other details of 주문 or 특수 능력). In\naddition, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from the highest spell\n레벨 castable.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Entangled:</span><span> The character is\nensnared. Being entangled impedes 이동, but does not entirely prevent it\nunless the bonds are anchored to an immobile object or tethered by an opposing\nforce. An entangled creature 이동 at half 속도, cannot 달리기 or 돌격, and\ntakes a –2 penalty on all 명중 굴림 and a –4 penalty to 민첩. An\nentangled character who attempts to 주문 시전 must make a 집중\ncheck (DC 15 + the spell’s 레벨) or lose the spell. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Exhausted:</span><span> An exhausted character\n이동 at half 속도 and takes a –6 penalty to 근력 and 민첩. After 1\nhour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes fatigued. A fatigued\ncharacter becomes exhausted by doing something else that would normally cause\nfatigue.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Fascinated:\n</span><span>A\nfascinated creature is entranced by a supernatural or spell effect. The\ncreature stands or sits quietly, taking no actions other than to pay attention\nto the fascinating effect, for as long as the effect lasts. It takes a –4\npenalty on 스킬 판정 made as reactions, such as 듣기 and 감지 checks. Any\npotential threat, such as a hostile creature approaching, allows the fascinated\ncreature a new 내성 굴림 against the fascinating effect. Any obvious threat,\nsuch as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at\nthe fascinated creature, automatically breaks the effect. A fascinated\ncreature’s ally may shake it free of the spell as a standard action. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Fatigued:</span><span> A fatigued character can\nneither 달리기 nor 돌격 and takes a –2 penalty to 근력 and 민첩. Doing\nanything that would normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued character to\nbecome exhausted. After 8 hours of complete rest, fatigued characters are no\nlonger fatigued. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Flat-Footed:</span><span> A character who has not\nyet acted during a 전투 I flat-footed, not yet reacting normally to the\nsituation. A flat-footed character loses his 민첩 bonus to AC (if any) and\ncannot make 기회 공격. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Frightened:</span><span> A frightened creature\nflees from the source of its 공포 as best it can. If unable to flee, it may\nfight. A frightened creature takes a –2 penalty on all 명중 굴림, 내성 굴림, 스킬 판정, and 능력 판정. A frightened creature can use 특수 능력, including 주문, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means\nif they are the only way to escape. </span></p><p>Frightened\nis like shaken, except that the creature must flee if possible. Panicked is a\nmore extreme state of 공포.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Grappling:</span><span> Engaged in wrestling or\nsome other form of hand-to-hand struggle with one or more attackers. A\ngrappling character can undertake only a limited number of actions. He does not\nthreaten any squares, and loses his 민첩 bonus to AC (if any) against\nopponents he isn’t grappling.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Helpless:</span><span> A helpless character is\nparalyzed, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">held</span>, bound, sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise completely\nat an opponent’s mercy. A helpless target is treated as having a 민첩 of 0\n(–5 modifier). Melee 공격 against a helpless target get a +4 bonus\n(equivalent to attacking a prone target). Ranged 공격 gets no special bonus\nagainst helpless targets. 도적 can sneak 공격 helpless targets. </span></p><p>As\na full-round action, an enemy can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace\nto a helpless foe. An enemy can also use a bow or crossbow, provided he is\nadjacent to the target. The attacker automatically hits and scores a critical\nhit. (A 도적 also gets her sneak 공격 피해 bonus against a helpless foe\nwhen delivering a coup de grace.) If the defender survives, he must make a\nFortitude save (DC 10 + 피해 dealt) or die. </p><p>Delivering\na coup de grace provokes 기회 공격. </p><p>Creatures\nthat are immune to critical hits do not take critical 피해, nor do they need\nto make Fortitude 내성 굴림 to avoid being killed by a coup de grace.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Incorporeal:\n</span><span>Having no\nphysical body. Incorporeal creatures are immune to all nonmagical 공격 forms.\nThey can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better 마법 무기, 주문, spell-like effects, or supernatural effects. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Invisible:</span><span> Visually undetectable.

Nauseated creatures are unable to 공격, cast 주문, concentrate on\n주문, or do anything else requiring attention. The only action such a\ncharacter can take is a single 이동 action per turn.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Panicked:\n</span><span>A\npanicked creature must drop anything it holds and flee at top 속도 from the\nsource of its 공포, as well as any other dangers it encounters, along a random\npath. It can’t take any other actions. In addition, the creature takes a –2\npenalty on all 내성 굴림, 스킬 판정, and 능력 판정. If cornered, a panicked\ncreature cowers and does not 공격, typically using the 총력 방어 action\nin 전투. A panicked creature can use 특수 능력, including 주문, to\nflee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to\nescape.</span></p><p>Panicked\nis a more extreme state of 공포 than shaken or frightened.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Paralyzed:</span><span> A paralyzed character is\nfrozen in place and unable to 이동 or act. A paralyzed character has effective\n민첩 and 근력 scores of 0 and is helpless, but can take purely mental actions.\nA winged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed\ncannot flap its wings and falls. A paralyzed swimmer can’t 수영 and may drown.\nA creature can 이동 through a space occupied by a paralyzed creature—ally or\nnot. Each square occupied by a paralyzed creature, however, counts as 2\nsquares.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Petrified:</span><span> A petrified character has\nbeen turned to stone and is considered unconscious. If a petrified character\ncracks or breaks, but the broken pieces are joined with the body as he returns\nto flesh, he is unharmed. If the character’s petrified body is incomplete when\nit returns to flesh, the body is likewise incomplete and there is some amount\nof permanent hit point loss and/or debilitation.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Pinned:</span><span> Held immobile (but not\nhelpless) in a 드잡이.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Prone:</span><span> The character is on the\nground.

The character is no longer 죽어가고 있음, but is still unconscious. If the\ncharacter has become stable because of 보조 from another character (such as a\n치료 check or magical 치료), then the character no longer loses 히트 포인트.\nHe has a 10% chance each hour of becoming conscious and 행동 불능 (even though\nhis 히트 포인트 are still negative). </span></p><p>If\nthe character became stable on his own and hasn’t had help, he is still at risk\nof losing 히트 포인트.
