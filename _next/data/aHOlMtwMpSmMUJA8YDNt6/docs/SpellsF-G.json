You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the\nwarning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence\nof such a warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even\ntelepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished\nbefore some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without\ndelay.

By naming a particular being or kind of being as\nyou cast the spell, you cause the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">gate </span>to open in the immediate vicinity\nof the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling.\nDeities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">gate, </span>although\nthey may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">gate\n</span>that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This\nuse of the spell has an XP cost (see below).</span></p><p>If\nyou choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual you may\ncall either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call\nand control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your\ncaster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do\nnot exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice\nyour caster level can’t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be\ncontrolled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the\ncalling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to\nits home plane at any time.</p><p>A\ncontrolled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such\nservices fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service.\nFighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be\naccomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you\nneed not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature’s help. The\ncreature departs at the end of the spell.</p><p>If\nyou choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called\ncreature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The\nservice exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or\nreward; see the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">lesser planar ally </span>spell for appropriate rewards. (Some\ncreatures may want their payment in “livestock” rather than in coin, which\ncould involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the\nbeing is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over\nthe promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to\nreturn to its own plane.</p><p>Failure\nto fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service\nby the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least.
