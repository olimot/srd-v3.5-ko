Usually, the deity must have all the listed 전제조건 to have the ability. A\n        신성 rank of 1 is a prerequisite for all 특화 신성 능력. The most common 특화 신성 능력 are described here. A\n        few deities have unique 특화 신성 능력 that are described in the deity의 individual entry.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <b>Using 특화 신성 능력:</b><span>\n          Using a salient 신성 ability is a standard action unless otherwise noted in the ability 묘사.

The assumed form must be\n            corporeal. The deity의 body can undergo a limited physical 변환술, including adding or subtracting one or\n            two limbs.

The deity merely thinks\n            of something and then makes it so.

The duplicated spell has no\n            material or XP component, and the DC of its 내성 굴림(if one is allowed) is 20 + the deity의 rank + the\n            deity의 매력 수정치.\n          </span>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The deity also can duplicate a spell with any 메타마법 feat (so long as 메타마법 feat is available to\n          characters of 20th 레벨 or lower). This use of the ability requires the deity to rest for 1 round for each\n          레벨 that the feat would normally add to the spell. It still takes a standard action to use this ability, so\n          there is no point in using the ability to duplicate a quickened spell.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The deity can render a magical or supernatural effect permanent. The rest requirement varies with the effect:\n          10 minutes per 레벨 of the effect times the number of subjects affected, 10 minutes per total 히트 다이스 of\n          creatures affected, or 10 minutes per 10-foot cube affected. Use the highest applicable value.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The deity can create temporary, nonmagical objects. This works like 물체 생성 ability (including the required\n          rest period), except that the items last one day per rank.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The deity also can create permanent nonmagical objects as if using 물체 생성 ability except that all rest\n          필요조건 are doubled and there is no reduction in rest time for being on an Outer Plane or in the deity의 own\n          realm.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The deity can create temporary 마법 아이템 or creatures. This works like 신성 제작 ability (including the\n          required rest period), except that the items or creatures created last 1 hour per rank. This ability cannot\n          create permanent 마법 아이템 or creatures.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The deity can reshape a landscape, creating any type of terrain the deity can imagine. Each 10-foot cube of\n          material to be reshaped requires 1 round of effort, and the deity must rest for one day per 10-foot cube\n          shaped after the work is completed.\n        </p>\n        <p><b>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</b><span> Any.</span></p>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"h3-5-alter-size\">\n        <h3>크기 변경</h3>\n        <div class=\"original-headline\">Alter Size</div>\n        <p>\n          <b>이익:</b><span>\n            As a free action, the deity can assume any size from Fine to Colossal.

If the deity has a familiar, personal 탈것, or personal\n            intelligent weapon, the creature can change size with the deity if the deity touches it, but its weight\n            counts against the deity의 weight limit.

An 화신 is an extension of a deity. The deity senses and knows everything 화신 senses and knows\n            and vice versa.
