You can squeeze through or into a space that is at least half as wide as your normal space. Each\n                이동 into or through a narrow space counts as if it were 2 squares, and while squeezed in a narrow space\n                you take a –4 페널티 on 명중 굴림 and a –4 페널티 to AC.</span>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              When a Large creature (which normally takes up four squares) squeezes into a space that의 one square wide,\n              the creature의 miniature figure occupies two squares, centered on the line between the two squares.

When\n                that happens, put your miniature in the last legal position you occupied, or the closest legal position,\n                if there의 a legal position that의 closer.</span>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <b>Double 이동 비용:</b><span>\n                When your 이동 is hampered in some way, your 이동 usually costs double. For example, each square of 이동\n                through difficult terrain counts as 2 squares, and each diagonal 이동 through such terrain counts as 3\n                squares (just as two diagonal 이동 normally do).</span>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              If 이동 cost is doubled twice, then each square counts as 4 squares (or as 6 squares if moving\n              diagonally). If 이동 cost is doubled three times, then each square counts as 8 squares (12 if diagonal)\n              and so on. This is an exception to the general rule that two doublings are equivalent to a tripling.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <b>Minimum 이동:</b><span>\n                Despite 페널티 to 이동, you can take a full-round action to 이동 5 feet (1 square) in any direction,\n                even diagonally. (This rule doesn’t allow you to 이동 through impassable terrain or to 이동 when all\n                이동 is prohibited.)

This means that more than one such creature can\n              fit into a single square. A Tiny creature typically occupies a space only 2-1/2 feet across, so four can\n              fit into a single square. Twenty-five Diminutive creatures or 100 Fine creatures can fit into a single\n              square. Creatures that take up less than 1 square of space typically have a natural reach of 0 feet,\n              meaning they can’t reach into adjacent squares. They must enter an opponent의 square to 공격 in melee.\n              This provokes an 공격 of opportunity from the opponent. You can 공격 into your own square if you need to,\n              so you can 공격 such creatures normally. Since they have no natural reach, they do not threaten the\n              squares around them. You can 이동 past them without provoking 기회 공격. They also can’t flank an\n              enemy.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Large, Huge, Gargantuan, and Colossal Creatures:</b><span> Very large creatures take up more than 1 square.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Creatures that take up more than 1 square typically have a natural reach of 10 feet or more, meaning that\n            they can reach targets even if they aren’t in adjacent squares.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Unlike when someone uses a 긴 무기, a creature with 상급 than normal natural reach (more than 5 feet)\n            still threatens squares adjacent to it. A creature with 상급 than normal natural reach usually gets an 공격\n            of opportunity against you if you approach it, because you must enter and 이동 within 거리 of its reach\n            before you can 공격 it.
