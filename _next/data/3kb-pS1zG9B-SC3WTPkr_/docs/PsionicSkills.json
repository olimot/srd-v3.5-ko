Each\n              successful check allows you to memorize a single page of text (up to 800 words), numbers, diagrams, or\n              sigils (even if you don’t recognize their meaning).

A failed 자기최면 check in this circumstance carries no direct\n              페널티—you can choose not to take the strenuous action and thus avoid the hit point loss.
