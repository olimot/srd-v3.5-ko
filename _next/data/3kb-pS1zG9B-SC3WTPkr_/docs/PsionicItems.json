Some items, once they are carried or worn, function constantly. In most cases,\n          using an item requires a standard action that does not provoke 기회 공격. By contrast, power completion items\n          (see below) are treated just like powers in 전투 and do provoke 기회 공격.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Activating a psionic item is a standard action unless the item 묘사 indicates otherwise. 구현 시간 of a power\n          is the time required to activate the same power in an item, whether it의 a power stone, a dorje, or a psionic\n          tattoo, unless the item 묘사 specifically states otherwise.\n        </p>\n        <p>The four ways to activate 사이오닉 아이템 are described below.</p>\n        <p>\n          <b>Power Completion:</b><span>\n            This is the activation method for 파워스톤. A power stone holds a power that is mostly finished. All that의\n            left to do is 공연 the short, simple, finishing parts of the manifestation (the final mental coda, as it\n            were). To use a power completion item safely, a character must be of high enough 레벨 in the appropriate\n            class to manifest the power already. If he can’t already manifest the power, there의 a chance he’ll make a\n            mistake (see Brainburn in the power stone 묘사). Activating a power completion item is a standard action and\n            provokes 기회 공격 exactly as manifesting a power does.</span>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Powers stored in power completion items are usually not augmented, because 구현자 레벨 of such an item is\n          assumed to be the minimum necessary to manifest the stored power. However, an item의 묘사 may specify\n          otherwise (some 파워스톤 have 구현자 레벨 higher than the minimum required to manifest the stored power, and\n          are then assumed to be augmented as well).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <b>Power 트리거:</b><span>\n            This is the activation method for 도르제 and 사이크라운. It requires the special 지식 of power manifestation\n            that a character of the appropriate class would know, and the formation of the appropriate 명령 thought. If\n            a power is on a character의 파워 목록, the character knows how to use a power 트리거 item that stores that\n            power. The user must still determine what power is stored in the item before she can activate it. Activating\n            a power 트리거 item is a standard action that does not provoke 기회 공격.</span>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Powers stored in power 트리거 items are not augmented. Such powers are assumed to be stored in the item at the\n          minimum 구현자 레벨 necessary to manifest the power. However, certain items may specify a higher 구현자 레벨\n          than necessary. If such an item holds a power that deals hit point 피해, the power is assumed to be augmented\n          to the maximum allowed by the power and 구현자 레벨.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <b>명령 Thought:</b><span>\n            If no activation method is suggested either in the psionic item 묘사 or by the nature of the item, assume\n            that a 명령 thought is needed to activate it. 명령 thought activation means that a character mentally\n            projects a thought, and the item activates. No other special 지식 is needed. Activating a 명령 thought\n            psionic item is a standard action that does not provoke 기회 공격.\n          </span>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Sometimes 명령 thought to activate an item is mentally imprinted within it and is whispered into the mind of a\n          creature who picks it up. Other items are silent, but a 지식(사이오닉) or 지식(history) check might be useful\n          in helping to 식별 명령 thoughts. A successful DC 30 check is needed to come up with 명령 thought in this\n          case. The power <i>psionic 식별 </i>reveals 명령 thoughts.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Powers stored in 명령 thought items are usually not augmented, because 구현자 레벨 of such an item is assumed\n          to be the minimum possible to manifest the stored power.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <b>Use-Activated: </b><span>This type of psionic item simply has to be used to activate. Use activation is generally straightforward\n            and self-explanatory.</span>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears. Some items made for wearing must still be\n          activated. Although this activation sometimes requires a 명령 thought (see above), usually it means mentally\n          willing the activation to happen&nbsp; (a free action). 묘사 of an item states whether a 명령 thought is\n          needed in such a case.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated psionic item is either a standard action or not an action\n          at all and does not provoke 기회 공격, unless the use involves performing an action that provokes 기회 공격 in\n          itself. If the use of the item takes time before a psionic effect occurs, then use activation is a standard\n          action. If the item의 activation is subsumed in its use and takes no extra time, use activation is not an\n          action at all.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Use activation doesn’t mean that if you use an item, you automatically know what it can do. You must know (or\n          at least guess) what the item can do and then use the item to activate it, unless the benefit of the item\n          comes automatically.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Powers stored in use-activated items are usually not augmented, because 구현자 레벨 of such an item is assumed\n          to be the minimum possible to manifest the stored power.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"h3-2-saving-throws-against-psionic-item-powers\">\n        <h3>사이오닉 아이템이 가진 힘에 대한 내성 굴림</h3>\n        <div class=\"original-headline\">SAVING THROWS AGAINST PSIONIC ITEM POWERS</div>\n        <p>\n          사이오닉 아이템 produce 사이오닉 파워.

Each dorje has 50 돌격 when created, and each\n            돌격 expended allows one use of that power. A dorje that 달리기 out of 돌격 is just a simple crystal.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Physical 묘사:</b><span>\n              A typical dorje is an elongated crystal of one color (or colorless), between 8 inches and 10 inches long\n              and about 1/2 inch thick, which can weigh up to 1/4 pound. Occasionally, a dorje is decorated with\n              carvings or inscribed 달리기 along a face of the crystal. A typical dorje has AC 7, 7 히트 포인트, a\n              hardness of 8, and a break DC of 18.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Activation:</b><span>\n              도르제 use the power 트리거 activation method, so manifesting a power from a dorje is usually a standard\n              action that does not provoke 기회 공격. (If the power being manifested has a 구현 시간 longer than 1\n              standard action, however, it takes that long to manifest the power from a dorje.) The user must have the\n              power on his class list, even if he knows 명령 thought. Additionally, to activate a dorje, a character\n              must hold it in hand and point it in the general direction of the target or 범위 to be affected.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            도르제 are normally created at the minimum 구현자 레벨 required to manifest the power, and powers that can\n            be augmented are not augmented when stored in a dorje. A dorje의 wielder cannot augment the power contained\n            within the dorje. However, 도르제 can be created at a higher 구현자 레벨 than required to manifest the\n            power. In this case, the dorje that holds an augmentable power is augmented, to the limit of 구현자 레벨 and\n            the power의 augmentation maximums, if any. 구현자 레벨 of a dorje cannot be more than five higher than the\n            minimum 구현자 레벨 to use the power it contains.\n          </p>\n          <div class=\"table-container\">\n            <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

A stored power can be used only once, “flushing” the\n            stone. Using a power stone is basically like manifesting a power.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Physical 묘사:</b><span>\n              A power stone is a thumb-sized chunk of crystal that possesses a barely detectable interior glow if it\n              holds a low-레벨 power. A stone imprinted with more than one power or a higher-레벨 power glows more\n              brightly, but never enough to provide illumination in its own right. A typical power stone has AC 7, 5\n              히트 포인트, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 20.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Activation:</b><span>\n              To activate a power stone, a manifester must mentally address it, as described below. Once the power is\n              known, the power stone is treated as a power completion item, except as noted below.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <i>Addressing the Stone: </i><span>A power stone must be “addressed” before a character can use it or know exactly what power it contains.\n              Doing this requires a successful 사이크래프트 check (DC 15 + power 레벨). Once a particular power stone\n              has been addressed, it is not necessary to do so again. Addressing a power stone in advance lets a\n              character proceed directly to the next step when the time comes to use it.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Using a stone의 stored power after addressing the stone requires holding the stone and willing the power의\n            manifestation, as if manifesting a power normally (a standard action). Activating a power stone is subject\n            to disruption just as manifesting a power normally would be.\n          </p>\n          <p>Additionally, the user must meet the following 필요조건.</p>\n          <p>• The user must have the power on his or her class list.</p>\n          <p>• The user must have the requisite 핵심 능력 score.</p>\n          <p>\n            If the user meets these 필요조건 and has a 구현자 레벨 at least equal to the power의 구현자 레벨, she can\n            automatically manifest the stored power without a check. If she meets both 필요조건 but her own 레벨 is\n            lower than the power stone의 구현자 레벨, she has to make a 구현자 레벨 check (1d20 + user의 레벨), against\n            a DC equal to the power stone의 구현자 레벨 +1, to manifest the power successfully. On a failure, the user\n            must succeed on a DC 5 지혜 check to avoid brainburn (see below). A natural roll of 1 on this check is\n            always a failure.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <i>Determine Effect: </i><span>A power successfully manifested from a power stone works exactly as if manifested normally.

Unlike 도르제, which can contain a wide variety\n            of powers, each psicrown is of a certain kind and holds specific powers. Unless otherwise stated, a psicrown\n            has 파워 포인트 equal to 50 x its 구현자 레벨 when created. These 파워 포인트 can be spent only on the\n            powers that are contained in the psicrown.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Physical 묘사:</b><span>\n              A typical psicrown is large enough to fit on the head of a Medium creature. Some 사이크라운 are actually\n              crownlike and heavily adorned, while others are simple headbands with crystal centerpieces. All 사이크라운\n              weigh less than 1 pound. Most 사이크라운 are metallic, but one could potentially be composed of any\n              material. Metallic 사이크라운 have AC 10, 10 히트 포인트, hardness 8, and a break DC of 28. 사이크라운\n              made of psionically reinforced silk have AC 7, 10 히트 포인트, hardness 2, and a break DC of 24.\n              사이크라운 can be made from other, more exotic materials, but all have at least 근력 and durability of\n              사이크라운 made of psionically reinforced silk.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Activation:</b><span>\n              사이크라운 use the power 트리거 activation method, so manifesting a power from a psicrown is usually a\n              standard action that does not provoke 기회 공격. (If the power being manifested, however, has a longer\n              구현 시간 than 1 standard action, it takes that long to manifest the power from a psicrown.) When\n              activating a psicrown, the user spends 파워 포인트 contained in the psicrown on any one of the psicrown의\n              powers. Powers activated from a psicrown can be augmented with additional 파워 포인트 from the psicrown\n              itself, so long as the total number of 파워 포인트 spent does not exceed the user의 구현자 레벨. The user\n              can’t manifest a power from a psicrown using his own 파워 포인트.</span>\n          </p>\n          <div class=\"table-container\">\n            <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 24.3751em\">\n              <tbody style=\"vertical-align: middle\">\n                <tr>\n                  <td colspan=\"4\">표: 사이크라운</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td>Medium</td>\n                  <td>Major</td>\n                  <td>Psicrown</td>\n                  <td>시장 가격</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td>01–20</td>\n                  <td>01–09</td>\n                  <td>Dominator</td>\n                  <td>20,250 gp</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td>21–51</td>\n                  <td>10–20</td>\n                  <td>Evader</td>\n                  <td>28,500 gp</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td>52–64</td>\n                  <td>21–31</td>\n                  <td>Cautious 군인</td>\n                  <td>32,063 gp</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td>65–79</td>\n                  <td>32–41</td>\n                  <td>Beast</td>\n                  <td>33,750 gp</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td>80–89</td>\n                  <td>42–58</td>\n                  <td>Great dominator</td>\n                  <td>45,000 gp</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td>90–97</td>\n                  <td>59–68</td>\n                  <td>Astral legion</td>\n                  <td>47,250 gp</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td>98–100</td>\n                  <td>69–78</td>\n                  <td>Discerning watcher</td>\n                  <td>51,469 gp</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td>—</td>\n                  <td>79–89</td>\n                  <td>Fiery 파멸</td>\n                  <td>67,500 gp</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td>—</td>\n                  <td>90–97</td>\n                  <td>Traveler</td>\n                  <td>80,156 gp</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td>—</td>\n                  <td>98–100</td>\n                  <td>Temporal juggler</td>\n                  <td>95,625 gp</td>\n                </tr>\n              </tbody>\n            </table>\n          </div>\n          <section id=\"h5-19-psicrown-descriptions\">\n            <h5>사이크라운 설명</h5>\n            <div class=\"original-headline\">Psicrown Descriptions</div>\n            <p>\n              사이크라운 have immense utility because they pack so many capabilities into one item and because they use\n              the wearer의 ability score and relevant 특기 to set the DC for 내성 굴림 against their powers.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Unlike with other sorts of 사이오닉 아이템, the wearer can use his 구현자 레벨 when activating the power\n              of a psicrown if it의 higher than 구현자 레벨 of the psicrown.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The minimum 구현자 레벨 of a psicrown is 8th. 구현자 레벨 of a psicrown cannot be more than five 레벨\n              higher than the minimum 구현자 레벨 for the highest-레벨 power in the psicrown.

This\n              design can be as simple as a circle or a star, or as complex as an artist 소원 to make it. Once it is\n              scribed, a tattoo의 design does not change.

As a standard\n            action, the wearer can will the tattoo to 이동 to a different part of his body or onto the skin of any\n            willing (or unconscious) living creature he touches. If the wearer of a psionic tattoo is rendered\n            unconscious or is slain, another sentient creature can touch the tattoo while willing it to leave the\n            previous wearer and apply itself to the new creature as a standard action. 사이오닉 문신 cannot overlay one\n            another.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Identifying 사이오닉 문신: </b><span>In addition to the standard methods of identification, the wearer of a tattoo can concentrate on it and\n              attempt to gain some sense of how it would feel if activated.

Like a psionic tattoo, a crawling tattoo can be scribed only with a power of no higher than\n                3rd 레벨 that targets one or more creatures. Exceptions are the\n                <i>신체 보정 </i>power, which can be scribed even though it affects\n                only the manifester, and 정신감응(충동) powers, which cannot be scribed at all. Powers that normally\n                have an 범위 affect only one target if scribed in a crawling tattoo. Powers with an experience point\n                requirement cannot be scribed into a crawling tattoo. Otherwise, crawling tattoos are treated as\n                사이오닉 문신 until they are activated by the wearer.</span>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The wearer of a crawling tattoo can tap the tattoo as a standard action that provokes 기회 공격, mentally\n              specifying a target (to which the wearer must have line of sight). Instead of manifesting its stored\n              power, the tattoo animates, drops to the ground, and scuttles toward the target. The original wearer need\n              no longer concentrate on the tattoo once animated.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The animated tattoo 이동 toward its designated target in the same round when it is activated. Treat it as\n              a Fine construct that has AC 18, 10 히트 포인트, a hardness of 5, 속도 30 feet, and 보너스 on 명중 굴림\n              equal to the wearer의 구현자 레벨 + his 핵심 능력 수정치. Crawling tattoos, unlike true constructs, are\n              subject to 환영술, 암흑, 안개, and similar effects. Should the target be killed, 순간이동 away, or\n              otherwise absent itself before the animated tattoo reaches it, the wearer can reclaim the tattoo. If it is\n              destroyed, a crawling tattoo 분쇄 and evaporates.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              A crawling tattoo must enter the target의 square to 공격 and thus provokes 기회 공격 as it passes through\n              the target의 threatened 범위. The tattoo makes one touch 공격&nbsp; per round thereafter until it strikes\n              its target or is destroyed. On a successful 공격, the power scribed in the crawling tattoo affects the\n              target if the target fails the appropriate 내성 굴림; however, powers that normally allow a Reflex 내성\n              굴림 automatically affect the touched target. Crawling tattoos can ferry beneficial powers as well as\n              harmful ones, and a target can allow the tattoo의 touch 공격 to succeed if he or she desires.\n            </p>\n            <p>Two examples of crawling tattoos are described below; many more types are possible.</p>\n            <p>\n              <i>시장 가격: </i><span>The cost of a crawling tattoo depends on 레벨 of the power scribed in it.</span>\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"table-container\">\n              <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 13.275em\">\n                <tbody style=\"vertical-align: middle\">\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>Power 레벨</td>\n                    <td>시장 가격</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>1st</td>\n                    <td>50 gp</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>2nd</td>\n                    <td>300 gp</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>3rd</td>\n                    <td>750 gp</td>\n                  </tr>\n                </tbody>\n              </table>\n            </div>\n            <p>\n              <i>Crawling Tattoo of Concussion</i><span>: This crawling tattoo delivers a concussion effect, dealing 1d6 points of 피해 to a creature hit by\n                its touch 공격.</span>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Faint 염동력; ML 1st; 우주적 아이템 제작, <i>뇌진탕 폭파; </i>Price 50\n              gp.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <i>Crawling Tattoo of 에너지 화살</i><span>: Each of these tattoos is keyed to one energy type: cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.
