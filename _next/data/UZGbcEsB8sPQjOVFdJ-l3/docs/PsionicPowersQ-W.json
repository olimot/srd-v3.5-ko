This substance shimmers like a silver mirror when\nviewed from some angles but is transparent from other viewpoints. You can\nsmooth a dollop of quintessence around any extremely small object.</p><p>Objects sealed\nwithin quintessence are protected from the effects of time; in practical terms,\nthey enter a state of stasis. Living flesh with only partial contact with\nquintessence is also partially pulled out of the time stream (the manifester is\nimmune to this effect). This disruption deals 1 point of damage per round\nbeginning 10 rounds after partial contact occurs.</p><p>Quintessence\ncan be manually scraped away from a protected object, freeing it to rejoin the\ntime stream. When you do this, there is a 75% chance that the quintessence\nevaporates back into the continuum. Otherwise, it coalesces again into a\n1-inch-diameter bead, available for later use.</p><p>Large\nquantities of quintessence could theoretically be gathered to preserve large\nitems or structures (or even a complete living creature; if completely immersed,\na living creature would not take the damage associated with partial contact).\nHowever, psionic characters and creatures are generally loath to do so because\naccumulations of quintessence weighing 1 pound or more hinder psionic activity\nwithin a 5-foot radius of the accumulation: Powers require twice as many power\npoints to manifest, unless the manifester makes a successful Will save each\ntime he or she attempts to manifest a power. Also in these circumstances,\nmanifesting a psi-like ability that is usable at will is a full-round action\nrather than a standard action.</p></section><section id=\"h3-2-read-thoughts\"><h3>생각 읽기</h3><p>Telepathy\n[Mind-Affecting]</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Level:</span><span> Telepath 2</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Display:</span><span> Mental</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Manifesting\nTime:</span><span> 1 standard action</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Range:</span><span> 60 ft.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Area:</span><span> Cone-shaped emanation centered on you</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Duration:</span><span> Concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Saving\nThrow:</span><span> Will negates; see text</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Power\nResistance:</span><span> No</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Power\nPoints:</span><span> 3</span></p><p>You know the\nsurface thoughts of the mind of any creature in the area that fails a Will\nsave.

This power does not restore life, but it returns a lost extremity to\na living or dead creature if the creature is otherwise mostly intact. The\noriginal extremity need not be present when this power is manifested; a new\nextremity is created by the power. If a head is restored to a body, the\noriginal head (if not already destroyed) loses all spark of identity, and can\nbe considered so much dead tissue.</p></section><section id=\"h3-11-retrieve\"><h3>물체 염동</h3><p>Psychoportation\n(Teleportation)</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Level:</span><span> Psion/wilder 6</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Display:</span><span> Visual</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Manifesting\nTime:</span><span> 1 standard action</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Range:</span><span> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./ level)</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Target:</span><span> One object you can hold or carry in one hand, weighing up to 10\nlb./level</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Duration:</span><span> Instantaneous</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Saving\nThrow:</span><span> Will negates; see text</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Power\nResistance:</span><span> No</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Power\nPoints:</span><span> 11</span></p><p>You\nautomatically teleport an item you can see within range directly to your hand.\nIf the object is in the possession of an opponent, it comes to your hand if\nyour opponent fails a Will save.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Augment:</span><span> For every additional power point you spend, the weight limit of the\ntarget increases by 10 pounds.</span></p></section><section id=\"h3-12-schism\"><h3>분립</h3><p>Telepathy\n[Mind-Affecting]</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Level:</span><span> Telepath 4</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Display:</span><span> Auditory and visual</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Manifesting\nTime:</span><span> 1 standard action</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Range:</span><span> Personal</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Target:</span><span> You</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Duration:</span><span> 1 round/level (D)</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Power\nPoints:</span><span> 7</span></p><p>Your mind\nsplits into two independent parts.

Thus, flanking opponents gain no bonus on their attack rolls, and\nrogues are denied their sneak attack ability because you do not lose your\nDexterity bonus (but they may still sneak attack you if you are caught\nflat-footed). Your Spot and Search checks gain a +4 enhancement bonus.\nConcurrently, you take a –4 penalty on saves against all gaze attacks during\nthe power’s duration.</p></section><section id=\"h3-58-ultrablast\"><h3>초대형폭파</h3><p>Telepathy\n[Mind-Affecting]</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Level:</span><span> Psion/wilder 7</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Display:</span><span> Auditory; see text</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Manifesting\nTime:</span><span> 1 standard action</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Range:</span><span> 15 ft.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Area:</span><span> 15-ft.-radius spread centered on you</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Duration:</span><span> Instantaneous</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Saving\nThrow:</span><span> Will half</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Power\nResistance:</span><span> Yes</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Power\nPoints:</span><span> 13</span></p><p>You “grumble”\npsychically (which both psionic and nonpsionic creatures can detect), then\nrelease a horrid shriek from your subconscious that disrupts the brains of all\nenemies in the power’s area, dealing 13d6 points of damage to each enemy.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Augment:</span><span> For every additional power point you spend, this power’s damage\nincreases by 1d6 points. </span></p></section><section id=\"h3-59-vampiric-blade\"><h3>뱀파이어 칼날</h3><p>Psychometabolism</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Level:</span><span> Psychic warrior 3</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Display:</span><span> Material and visual</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Manifesting\nTime:</span><span> 1 standard action</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Range:</span><span> 0 ft.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Target:</span><span> One weapon you hold</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Duration:</span><span> 1 round/level</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Power\nPoints:</span><span> 5</span></p><p>As <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">claws of\nthe vampire</span>, except your weapon is affected as long as it remains in your\ngrip or until this power’s duration expires.</p></section><section id=\"h3-60-vigor\"><h3>활력</h3><p>Psychometabolism</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Level:</span><span> Psion/wilder 1, psychic warrior 1</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Display:</span><span> Material and olfactory</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Manifesting\nTime:</span><span> 1 standard action</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Range:</span><span> Personal</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Target:</span><span> You</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Duration:</span><span> 1 min./level</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Power\nPoints:</span><span> 1</span></p><p>You suffuse\nyourself with power, gaining 5 temporary hit points.
