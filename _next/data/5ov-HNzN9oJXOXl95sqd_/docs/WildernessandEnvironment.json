Many dungeons are variations on these\n            basic types or combinations of more than one of them. Sometimes old dungeons are used again and again by\n            different inhabitants for different purposes.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Ruined Structure:</span\n            ><span>\n              Once occupied, this place is now abandoned (completely or in part) by its original creator or creators,\n              and other creatures have wandered in. Many subterranean creatures look for abandoned underground\n              constructions in which to make their lairs. Any traps that might exist have probably been set off, but\n              wandering beasts might very well be common.</span\n            >\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Occupied Structure:</span\n            ><span>\n              This type of dungeon is still in use. Creatures (usually intelligent) live there, although they may not be\n              the dungeon’s creators. An occupied structure might be a home, a fortress, a temple, an active mine, a\n              prison, or a headquarters. This type of dungeon is less likely to have traps or wandering beasts, and more\n              likely to have organized guards—both on watch and on patrol. Traps or wandering beasts that might be\n              encountered are usually under the control of the occupants. Occupied structures have furnishings to suit\n              the inhabitants, as well as decorations, supplies, and the ability for occupants to move around (doors\n              they can open, hallways large enough for them to pass through, and so on). The inhabitants might have a\n              communication system, and they almost certainly control an access to the outside.</span\n            >\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Some dungeons are partially occupied and partially empty or in ruins. In such cases, the occupants are\n            typically not the original builders but instead a group of intelligent creatures that have set up their\n            base, lair, or fortification within an abandoned dungeon.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Safe Storage: </span\n            ><span\n              >When people want to protect something, they might bury it underground. Whether the item they want to\n              protect is a fabulous 전리품, a forbidden artifact, or the dead body of an important figure, these\n              valuable objects are placed within a dungeon and surrounded by barriers, traps, and guardians.</span\n            >\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The safe storage type of dungeon is the most likely to have traps but the least likely to have wandering\n            beasts. This type of dungeon normally is built for function rather than appearance, but sometimes it has\n            ornamentation in the form of statuary or painted walls. This is particularly true of the tombs of important\n            people.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Sometimes, however, a vault or a crypt is constructed in such a way as to house living guardians. The\n            problem with this strategy is that something must be done to keep the creatures alive between intrusion\n            attempts. Magic is usually the best solution to provide food and water for these creatures. Even if there’s\n            no way anything living can survive in a safe storage dungeon, certain monsters can still serve as guardians.\n            Builders of vaults or tombs often place undead creatures or constructs, both of which which have no need for\n            sustenance or rest, to guard their dungeons. Magic traps can attack intruders by summoning monsters into the\n            dungeon. These guardians also need no sustenance, since they appear only when they’re needed and disappear\n            when their task is done.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Natural Cavern Complex:</span\n            ><span>\n              Underground caves provide homes for all sorts of subterranean monsters. Created naturally and connected by\n              a labyrinthine tunnel system, these caverns lack any sort of pattern, order, or decoration. With no\n              intelligent force behind its construction, this type of dungeon is the least likely to have traps or even\n              doors.</span\n            >\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Fungi of all sorts thrive in caves, sometimes growing in huge forests of mushrooms and puffballs.\n            Subterranean predators prowl these forests, looking for those feeding upon the fungi. Some varieties of\n            fungus give off a phosphorescent glow, providing a natural cavern complex with its own limited light source.\n            In other areas, a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">daylight </span>spell or similar magical effect can\n            provide enough light for green plants to grow.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Often, a natural cavern complex connects with another type of dungeons, the caves having been discovered\n            when the manufactured dungeon was delved. A cavern complex can connect two otherwise unrelated dungeons,\n            sometimes creating a strange mixed environment. A natural cavern complex joined with another dungeon often\n            provides a route by which subterranean creatures find their way into a manufactured dungeon and populate it.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"h2-3-dungeon-terrain\">\n        <h2>던전 지형</h2>\n        <section id=\"h3-4-walls\">\n          <h3>벽</h3>\n          <p>\n            Sometimes, masonry walls—stones piled on top of each other (usually but not always held in place with\n            mortar)—divide dungeons into corridors and chambers. Dungeon walls can also be hewn from solid rock, leaving\n            them with a rough, chiseled look. Or, dungeon walls can be the smooth, unblemished stone of a naturally\n            occurring cave.

Wooden doors come in varying\n              strengths: simple, good, and strong doors. Simple doors (break DC 13) are not meant to keep out motivated\n              attackers. Good doors (break DC 16), while sturdy and long-lasting, are still not meant to take much\n              punishment. Strong doors (break DC 23) are bound in iron and are a sturdy barrier to those attempting to\n              get past them. Iron hinges fasten the door to its frame, and typically a circular pull-ring in the center\n              is there to help open it. Sometimes, instead of a pull-ring, a door has an iron pull-bar on one or both\n              sides of the door to serve as a handle. In inhabited dungeons, these doors are usually well maintained\n              (not stuck) and unlocked, although important areas are locked up if possible.</span\n            >\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Stone:</span\n            ><span>\n              Carved from solid blocks of stone, these heavy, unwieldy doors are often built so that they pivot when\n              opened, although dwarves and other skilled craftsfolk are able to fashion hinges strong enough to hold up\n              a stone door. Secret doors concealed within a stone wall are usually stone doors. Otherwise, such doors\n              stand as tough barriers protecting something important beyond. Thus, they are often locked or\n              barred.</span\n            >\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Iron: </span\n            ><span\n              >Rusted but sturdy, iron doors in a dungeon are hinged like wooden doors.

Locks are usually built\n              into the door, either on the edge opposite the hinges or right in the middle of the door. Builtin locks\n              either control an iron bar that juts out of the door and into the wall of its frame, or else a sliding\n              iron bar or heavy wooden bar that rests behind the entire door. By contrast, padlocks are not built-in but\n              usually run through two rings, one on the door and the other on the wall. More complex locks, such as\n              combination locks and puzzle locks, are usually built into the door itself. Because such keyless locks are\n              larger and more complex, they are typically only found in sturdy doors (strong wooden, stone, or iron\n              doors).</span\n            >\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The Open Lock DC to pick a lock often falls into the range of 20 to 30, although locks with lower or higher\n            DCs can exist. A door can have more than one lock, each of which must be unlocked separately. Locks are\n            often trapped, usually with poison needles that extend out to prick a rogue’s finger.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Breaking a lock is sometimes quicker than breaking the whole door. If a PC wants to whack at a lock with a\n            weapon, treat the typical lock as having hardness 15 and 30 체력. A lock can only be broken if it can be\n            attacked separately from the door, which means that a built-in lock is immune to this sort of treatment. In\n            an occupied dungeon, every locked door should have a key somewhere.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A special door (see below for examples) might have a lock with no key, instead requiring that the right\n            combination of nearby levers must be manipulated or the right symbols must be pressed on a keypad in the\n            correct sequence to open the door.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Stuck Doors: </span\n            ><span\n              >Dungeons are often damp, and sometimes doors get stuck, particularly wooden doors.

Such a task\n              has a DC of 20 because most hinges are rusted or stuck. Breaking a hinge is difficult. Most have hardness\n              10 and 30 체력.

The advantages of pivots is that they can’t be\n              dismantled like hinges and they’re simple to make. The disadvantage is that since the door pivots on its\n              center of gravity (typically in the middle), nothing larger than half the door’s width can fit through.\n              Doors with pivots are usually stone and are often quite wide to overcome this disadvantage. Another\n              solution is to place the pivot toward one side and have the door be thicker at that end and thinner toward\n              the other end so that it opens more like a normal door. Secret doors in walls often turn on pivots, since\n              the lack of hinges makes it easier to hide the door’s presence. Pivots also allow objects such as\n              bookcases to be used as secret doors.</span\n            >\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Secret Doors:</span\n            ><span>\n              Disguised as a bare patch of wall (or floor, or ceiling), a bookcase, a fireplace, or a fountain, a secret\n              door leads to a secret passage or room.

The presence of a tree doesn’t otherwise affect a creature’s\n                fighting space, because it’s assumed that the creature is using the tree to its advantage when it can.\n                The trunk of a typical tree has AC 4, hardness 5, and 150 hp. A DC 15 Climb check is sufficient to climb\n                a tree. Medium and dense forests have massive trees as well. These trees take up an entire square and\n                provide cover to anyone behind them. They have AC 3, hardness 5, and 600 hp.

Undergrowth increases\n                the DC of Tumble and Move Silently checks by 2 because the leaves and branches get in the way. Heavy\n                undergrowth costs 4 squares of movement to move into, and it provides concealment with a 30% miss chance\n                (instead of the usual 20%). It increases the DC of Tumble and Move Silently checks by 5. Heavy\n                undergrowth is easy to hide in, granting a +5 circumstance bonus on Hide checks. Running and charging\n                are impossible. Squares with undergrowth are often clustered together.

Certain peaks and ridgelines afford much better vantage\n                points, of course, and twisting valleys and canyons have much shorter spotting distances. Because\n                there’s little vegetation to obstruct line of sight, the specifics on your map are your best guide for\n                the range at which an encounter could begin. As in hills terrain, a ridge or peak provides enough cover\n                to hide from anyone below the high point.</span\n              >\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              It’s easier to hear faraway sounds in the mountains.

While avalanches of snow and ice are common, it’s also possible to have an avalanche of\n              rock and soil.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              An avalanche can be spotted from as far away as 1d10×500 feet downslope by a character who makes a DC 20\n              Spot check, treating the avalanche as a Colossal creature. If all characters fail their Spot checks to\n              determine the encounter distance, the avalanche moves closer to them, and they automatically become aware\n              of it when it closes to half the original distance. It’s possible to hear an avalanche coming even if you\n              can’t see it. Under optimum conditions (no other loud noises occurring), a character who makes a DC 15\n              Listen check can hear the avalanche or landslide when it is 1d6×500 feet away. This check might have a DC\n              of 20, 25, or higher in conditions where hearing is difficult (such as in the middle of a thunderstorm).\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              A landslide or avalanche consists of two distinct areas: the bury zone (in the direct path of the falling\n              debris) and the slide zone (the area the debris spreads out to encompass). Characters in the bury zone\n              always take damage from the avalanche; characters in the slide zone may be able to get out of the way.\n              Characters in the bury zone take 8d6 points of damage, or half that amount if they make a DC 15 Reflex\n              save. They are subsequently buried (see below). Characters in the slide zone take 3d6 points of damage, or\n              no damage if they make a DC 15 Reflex save. Those who fail their saves are buried.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Buried characters take 1d6 points of 비치명적인 피해 per minute. If a buried character falls unconscious,\n              he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter\n              until freed or dead.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The typical avalanche has a width of 1d6×100 feet, from one edge of the slide zone to the opposite edge.\n              The bury zone in the center of the avalanche is half as wide as the avalanche’s full width.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              To determine the precise location of characters in the path of an avalanche, roll 1d6×20; the result is\n              the number of feet from the center of the path taken by the bury zone to the center of the party’s\n              location. Avalanches of snow and ice advance at a speed of 500 feet per round, and rock avalanches travel\n              at a speed of 250 feet per round.\n            </p>\n          </section>\n          <section id=\"h4-27-mountain-travel\">\n            <h4>산악 여행</h4>\n            <p>\n              High altitude can be extremely fatiguing—or sometimes deadly—to creatures that aren’t used to it.

If the check fails, the steed crosses the fence, but the rider falls out\n                of the saddle.</span\n              >\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Other Plains Terrain Features:</span\n              ><span>\n                Occasional trees dot the landscape in many plains, although on battlefields they’re often felled to\n                provide raw material for siege engines (described in Urban Features).

Aquatic terrain\n            doesn’t offer the variety that land terrain does. The ocean floor holds many marvels, including undersea\n            analogues of any of the terrain elements described earlier in this section. But if characters find\n            themselves in the water because they were bull rushed off the deck of a pirate ship, the tall kelp beds\n            hundreds of feet below them don’t matter. Accordingly, these rules simply divide aquatic terrain into two\n            categories: flowing water (such as streams and rivers) and nonflowing water (such as lakes and oceans).\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Flowing Water:</span\n            ><span>\n              Large, placid rivers move at only a few miles per hour, so they function as still water for most purposes.\n              But some rivers and streams are swifter; anything floating in them moves downstream at a speed of 10 to 40\n              feet per round. The fastest rapids send swimmers bobbing downstream at 60 to 90 feet per round. Fast\n              rivers are always at least rough water (Swim DC 15), and whitewater rapids are stormy water (Swim DC 20).\n              If a character is in moving water, move her downstream the indicated distance at the end of her turn.

Escaping the rapids by reaching the bank requires three DC 20 Swim checks in a row.\n              Characters arrested by a rock, limb, or snag can’t escape under their own power unless they strike out\n              into the water and attempt to swim their way clear.

Adventures\n            that take place in cities have two salient differences from their dungeon counterparts, however.

A city,\n              on the other hand, is held together by a code of laws, many of which are explicitly designed to prevent\n              the sort of behavior that adventurers engage in all the time: killing and looting. Even so, most cities’\n              laws recognize monsters as a threat to the stability the city relies on, and prohibitions about murder\n              rarely apply to monsters such as aberrations or evil outsiders. Most evil humanoids, however, are\n              typically protected by the same laws that protect all the citizens of the city. Having an evil alignment\n              is not a crime (except in some severely theocratic cities, perhaps, with the magical power to back up the\n              law); only evil deeds are against the law. Even when adventurers encounter an evildoer in the act of\n              perpetrating some heinous evil upon the populace of the city, the law tends to frown on the sort of\n              vigilante justice that leaves the evildoer dead or otherwise unable to testify at a trial.</span\n            >\n          </p>\n          <section id=\"h4-37-weapon-and-spell-restrictions\">\n            <h4>무기 및 주문 제한</h4>\n            <p>\n              Different cities have different laws about such issues as carrying weapons in public and restricting\n              spellcasters.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The city’s laws may not affect all characters equally.

A typical small city wall is a fortified stone wall 5 feet thick and\n              20 feet high. Such a wall is fairly smooth, requiring a DC 30 Climb check to scale. The walls are\n              crenellated on one side to provide a low wall for the guards atop it, and there is just barely room for\n              guards to walk along the top of the wall.

Sometimes these\n              walls are as large and thick as the outer walls, but more often they have the characteristics of a large\n              city’s or small city’s walls.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Watch Towers:</span\n              ><span>\n                Some city walls are adorned with watch towers set at irregular intervals.

Arrow slits line the outer sides of the upper stories of a tower, and the top is\n              crenellated like the surrounding walls are. In a small tower (25 feet in diameter adjoining a 5-foot-thick\n              wall), a simple ladder typically connect the tower’s stories and the roof.

If the check succeeds, the catapult stone hits the square the catapult was aimed\n                at, dealing the indicated damage to any object or character in the square. Characters who succeed on a\n                DC 15 Reflex save take half damage.
