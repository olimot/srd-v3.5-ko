Some creatures have damage reduction\n          based on their creature type or core concept. Some are resistant to all but a special type of damage, such as\n          that dealt by evil-aligned weapons or bludgeoning weapons.

Weapons fashioned from adamantine\n            have a natural ability to bypass hardness when sundering weapons or attacking objects, ignoring hardness\n            less than 20. Armor made from adamantine grants its wearer damage reduction of 1/– if it’s light armor, 2/–\n            if it’s medium armor, and 3/– if it’s heavy armor. Adamantine is so costly that weapons and armor made from\n            it are always of masterwork quality; the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below. Thus,\n            adamantine weapons and ammunition have a +1 enhancement bonus on 명중 굴림, and the armor check penalty\n            of adamantine armor is lessened by 1 compared to ordinary armor of its type. Items without metal parts\n            cannot be made from adamantine. An arrow could be made of adamantine, but a quarterstaff could not.</span\n          >\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Only weapons, armor, and shields normally made of metal can be fashioned from adamantine.

The armor check penalty of a darkwood shield is lessened by 2 compared to an ordinary shield of\n            its type.

When worked\n            like steel, it becomes a wonderful material from which to create armor and is occasionally used for other\n            items as well. Most mithral armors are one category lighter than normal for purposes of movement and other\n            limitations. Heavy armors are treated as medium, and medium armors are treated as light, but light armors\n            are still treated as light. Spell failure chances for armors and shields made from mithral are decreased by\n            10%, maximum Dexterity bonus is increased by 2, and armor check penalties are lessened by 3 (to a minimum of\n            0).</span\n          >\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          An item made from mithral weighs half as much as the same item made from other metals. In the case of weapons,\n          this lighter weight does not change a weapon’s size category or the ease with which it can be wielded (whether\n          it is light, one-handed, or two-handed). Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being\n          partially made of mithral.
