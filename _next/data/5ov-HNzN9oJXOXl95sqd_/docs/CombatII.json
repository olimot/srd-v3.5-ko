(This rule doesn’t allow you to move through impassable terrain or to move\n                when all movement is prohibited.) Such movement provokes 기회 공격 as normal (despite the distance\n                covered, this move isn’t a 5-foot step).</span\n              >\n            </p>\n          </section>\n        </section>\n        <section id=\"h3-8-big-and-little-creatures-in-combat\">\n          <h3>전투 시 크거나 작은 크리처</h3>\n          <p>Creatures smaller than Small or larger than Medium have special rules relating to position.</p>\n          <p>\n            <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine Creatures:</span\n            ><span>\n              Very small creatures take up less than 1 square of space. This means that more than one such creature can\n              fit into a single square. A Tiny creature typically occupies a space only 2-1/2 feet across, so four can\n              fit into a single square. Twenty-five Diminutive creatures or 100 Fine creatures can fit into a single\n              square. Creatures that take up less than 1 square of space typically have a natural reach of 0 feet,\n              meaning they can’t reach into adjacent squares. They must enter an opponent’s square to attack in melee.\n              This provokes an attack of opportunity from the opponent. You can attack into your own square if you need\n              to, so you can attack such creatures normally. Since they have no natural reach, they do not threaten the\n              squares around them. You can move past them without provoking 기회 공격. They also can’t flank an\n              enemy.</span\n            >\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Large, Huge, Gargantuan, and Colossal Creatures:</span\n            ><span> Very large creatures take up more than 1 square.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Creatures that take up more than 1 square typically have a natural reach of 10 feet or more, meaning that\n            they can reach targets even if they aren’t in adjacent squares.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Unlike when someone uses a reach weapon, a creature with greater than normal natural reach (more than 5\n            feet) still threatens squares adjacent to it.

If you have your mount move both before and after you cast a spell, then you’re casting the\n              spell while the mount is moving, and you have to make a Concentration check due to the vigorous motion (DC\n              10 + spell level) or lose the spell. If the mount is running (quadruple speed), you can cast a spell when\n              your mount has moved up to twice its speed, but your Concentration check is more difficult due to the\n              violent motion (DC 15 + spell level).</span\n            >\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">If Your Mount Falls in Battle:</span\n            ><span>\n              If your mount falls, you have to succeed on a DC 15 Ride check to make a soft fall and take no damage.

(In general, you cannot take a\n            standard action during a move; this is an exception.) With an overrun, you attempt to plow past or over your\n            opponent (and move through his square) as you move. You can only overrun an opponent who is one size\n            category larger than you, the same size, or smaller.

The defender gets a +4 bonus on his check if he has more than two legs or is otherwise more\n              stable than a normal humanoid. If you win, you knock the defender prone. If you lose, the defender may\n              immediately react and make a Strength check opposed by your Dexterity or Strength check (including the\n              size modifiers noted above, but no other modifiers) to try to knock you prone.</span\n            >\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Step 4: </span\n            ><span\n              >Consequences.
