Those who fail take a –2 penalty on attacks, AC,\n        and saves for 24 hours or until they successfully hit the archon that generated the aura. A creature that has\n        resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by the same archon’s aura for 24 hours.\n      </p>\n      <p>—Immunity to electricity and petrification.</p>\n      <p>— +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.</p>\n      <p>\n        —Magic Circle against Evil (Su): A magic circle against evil effect always surrounds an archon (caster level\n        equals the archon’s Hit Dice). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an archon’s\n        statistics block.)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —Teleport (Su): Archons can use greater teleport at will, as the spell (caster level 14th), except that the\n        creature can transport only itself and up to 50 pounds of objects.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —Tongues (Su): All archons can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a\n        <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">tongues </span>spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Augmented Subtype:</span\n        ><span>\n          A creature receives this subtype whenever something happens to change its original type. Some creatures (those\n          with an inherited template) are born with this subtype; others acquire it when they take on an acquired\n          template. The augmented subtype is always paired with the creature’s original type. A creature with the\n          augmented subtype usually has the traits of its current type, but the features of its original type.</span\n        >\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Blindsense (Ex):</span\n        ><span>\n          Using nonvisual senses, such as acute smell or hearing, a creature with blindsense notices things it cannot\n          see. The creature usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to pinpoint the location of a creature\n          within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to that creature. Any opponent the\n          creature cannot see still has total concealment against the creature with blindsense, and the creature still\n          has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of\n          a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to 방어도 against\n          attacks from creatures it cannot see.</span\n        >\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Blindsight (Ex):</span\n        ><span>\n          This ability is similar to blindsense, but is far more discerning. Using nonvisual senses, such as sensitivity\n          to vibrations, keen smell, acute hearing, or echolocation, a creature with blindsight maneuvers and fights as\n          well as a sighted creature. 투명상태, darkness, and most kinds of concealment are irrelevant, though the\n          creature must have line of effect to a creature or object to discern that creature or object. The ability’s\n          range is specified in the creature’s descriptive text. The creature usually does not need to make Spot or\n          Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight ability. Unless noted otherwise, blindsight\n          is continuous, and the creature need do nothing to use it. Some forms of blindsight, however, must be\n          triggered as a free action. If so, this is noted in the creature’s description. If a creature must trigger its\n          blindsight ability, the creature gains the benefits of blindsight only during its turn.</span\n        >\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">브레스 무기 (Su): </span\n        ><span>브레스 무기 attack usually deals damage and is often based on some type of energy.</span>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Such 브레스 무기 allow a Reflex save for half damage (DC 10 + 1/2 breathing creature’s racial HD + breathing\n        creature’s Con modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). A creature is immune to its\n        own 브레스 무기 unless otherwise noted. Some 브레스 무기 allow a Fortitude save or a Will save instead of a\n        Reflex save.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Change Shape (Su):</span\n        ><span>\n          A creature with this special quality has the ability to assume the appearance of a specific creature or type\n          of creature (usually a humanoid), but retains most of its own physical qualities. A creature cannot change\n          shape to a form more than one size category smaller or larger than its original form. Changing shape results\n          in the following changes to the creature:</span\n        >\n      </p>\n      <p>—The creature retains the type and subtype of its original form. It gains the size of its new form.</p>\n      <p>\n        —The creature loses the natural weapons, movement modes, and extraordinary special attacks of its original form.\n      </p>\n      <p>—The creature gains the natural weapons, movement modes, and extraordinary special attacks of its new form.</p>\n      <p>\n        —The creature retains all other special attacks and qualities of its original form, except for 브레스 무기 and\n        시선 공격.\n      </p>\n      <p>—The creature retains the 능력치 점수 of its original form.</p>\n      <p>—The creature retains its 체력 and saves.</p>\n      <p>\n        —The creature retains any spellcasting ability it had in its original form, although it must be able to speak\n        intelligibly to cast spells with verbal components and it must have humanlike hands to cast spells with somatic\n        components.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —The creature is effectively camouflaged as a creature of its new form, and gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks\n        if it uses this ability to create a disguise.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Chaotic Subtype: </span\n        ><span\n          >A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the chaotic-aligned Outer Planes. Most creatures that\n          have this subtype also have chaotic alignments; however, if their alignments change they still retain the\n          subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has a\n          chaotic alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to\n          its actual alignment. A creature with the chaotic subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons\n          and any weapons it wields were chaotic-aligned (see Damage Reduction, below).</span\n        >\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Cold Subtype: </span\n        ><span\n          >A creature with the cold subtype has immunity to cold.

When a cleric casts\n        <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">align weapon, </span>affected weapons might gain one or more of these\n        properties, and certain magic weapons have these properties as well. A creature with an alignment subtype\n        (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) can overcome this type of damage reduction with its natural weapons and weapons\n        it wields as if the weapons or natural weapons had an alignment (or alignments) that match the subtype(s) of the\n        creature.\n      </p>\n      <p>When a damage reduction entry has a dash (–) after the slash, no weapon negates the damage reduction.</p>\n      <p>\n        A few creatures are harmed by more than one kind of weapon.

Each successful energy drain bestows one or more negative levels (the creature’s description specifies\n          how many). If an attack that includes an energy drain scores a critical hit, it drains twice the given amount.\n          Unless otherwise specified in the creature’s description, a draining creature gains 5 temporary 체력 (10 on a\n          critical hit) for each negative level it bestows on an opponent. These temporary 체력 last for a maximum of 1\n          hour. An affected opponent takes a –1 penalty on all 스킬 판정 and ability checks, 명중 굴림, and 내성 굴림,\n          and loses one effective level or Hit Die (whenever level is used in a die roll or calculation) for each\n          negative level. A spellcaster loses one spell slot of the highest level of spells she can cast and (if\n          applicable) one prepared spell of that level; this loss persists until the negative level is removed. Negative\n          levels remain until 24 hours have passed or until they are removed with a spell, such as\n          <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">restoration</span>. If a negative level is not removed before 24 hours have\n          passed, the affected creature must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 draining creature’s racial HD +\n          draining creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). On a success, the\n          negative level goes away with no harm to the creature. On a failure, the negative level goes away, but the\n          creature’s level is also reduced by one. A separate 내성 굴림 is required for each negative level.</span\n        >\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Evil Subtype: </span\n        ><span\n          >A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the evil-aligned Outer Planes.

Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this\n          subtype as if the creature has an evil alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also\n          suffers effects according to its actual alignment.

Every extraplanar\n          creature in this book has a home plane mentioned in its description. Creatures not labeled as extraplanar are\n          natives of the Material Plane, and they gain the extraplanar subtype if they leave the Material Plane.

It takes effect automatically when\n          the creature performs some sort of dramatic action (such as charging, attacking, or snarling). Opponents\n          within range who witness the action may become frightened or shaken. Actions required to trigger the ability\n          are given in the creature’s descriptive text. The range is usually 30 feet, and the duration is usually 5d6\n          rounds. This ability affects only opponents with fewer Hit Dice or levels than the creature has. An affected\n          opponent can resist the effects with a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 frightful creature’s racial HD +\n          frightful creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). An opponent that\n          succeeds on the 내성 굴림 is immune to that same creature’s frightful presence for 24 hours.

The type of 내성 굴림 for 시선 공격 varies, but it is usually a Will or Fortitude save (DC\n          10 + 1/2 gazing creature’s racial HD + gazing creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s\n          descriptive text). A successful 내성 굴림 negates the effect. A monster’s 시선 공격 is described in\n          abbreviated form in its description. Each opponent within range of 시선 공격 must attempt a 내성 굴림 each\n          round at the beginning of his or her turn in the initiative order. Only looking directly at a creature with\n          시선 공격 leaves an opponent vulnerable.

No\n          initial touch attack is required. Unless otherwise noted, improved grab works only against opponents at least\n          one size category smaller than the creature. The creature has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or\n          simply use the part of its body it used in the improved grab to hold the opponent. If it chooses to do the\n          latter, it takes a –20 penalty on grapple checks, but is not considered grappled itself; the creature does not\n          lose its Dexterity bonus to AC, still threatens an area, and can use its remaining attacks against other\n          opponents.

In order to see farther\n        from the object it is in and attack normally, the incorporeal creature must emerge. An incorporeal creature\n        inside an object has total cover, but when it attacks a creature outside the object it only has cover, so a\n        creature outside with a readied action could strike at it as it attacks.

These creatures have mortal ancestors or a strong connection to the\n          Material Plane and can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living creatures can be.\n          Creatures with this subtype are native to the Material Plane (hence the subtype’s name). Unlike true\n          outsiders, native outsiders need to eat and sleep.\n        </span>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Natural Weapons:</span\n        ><span>\n          Natural weapons are weapons that are physically a part of a creature. A creature making a melee attack with a\n          natural weapon is considered armed and does not provoke 기회 공격. Likewise, it threatens any space it can\n          reach. Creatures do not receive additional attacks from a high base 공격 보너스 when using natural weapons.\n          The number of attacks a creature can make with its natural weapons depends on the type of the\n          attack—generally, a creature can make one bite attack, one attack per claw or tentacle, one gore attack, one\n          sting attack, or one slam attack (although Large creatures with arms or arm-like limbs can make a slam attack\n          with each arm). Refer to the individual monster descriptions.</span\n        >\n      </p>\n      <p>Unless otherwise noted, a natural weapon threatens a critical hit on a natural 명중 굴림 of 20.</p>\n      <p>\n        When a creature has more than one natural weapon, one of them (or sometimes a pair or set of them) is the\n        primary weapon. All the creature’s remaining natural weapons are secondary.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The primary weapon is given in the creature’s Attack entry, and the primary weapon or weapons is given first in\n        the creature’s Full Attack entry. A creature’s primary natural weapon is its most effective natural attack,\n        usually by virtue of the creature’s physiology, training, or innate talent with the weapon. An attack with a\n        primary natural weapon uses the creature’s full 공격 보너스. Attacks with secondary natural weapons are less\n        effective and are made with a –5 penalty on the 명중 굴림, no matter how many there are. (Creatures with the\n        Multiattack feat take only a –2 penalty on secondary attacks.) This penalty applies even when the creature makes\n        a single attack with the secondary weapon as part of the attack action or as an attack of opportunity.\n      </p>\n      <p>Natural weapons have types just as other weapons do.
