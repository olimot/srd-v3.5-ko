In general, a deity only accepts minions who have\naccomplished some great deed in service to the deity. Such minions usually have\nthe same alignment as the deity. No minion’s alignment is opposed to the patron\ndeity’s alignment on either the law–chaos axis or the good–evil axis. </p><section id=\"h3-1-proxies\"><h3>Proxies</h3><p>A divine proxy\nspeaks and acts on behalf of the divine being. When the demand for a deity’s\npresence is too high, the deity may use proxies.</p><p>Proxies are divine\nminions invested with a small portion of the deity’s power. A deity may invest\n1 rank of its power (reducing its divine rank accordingly) in a single servant\nfor as long as the deity chooses. The minion must be physically present for the\ndeity to perform the investiture. While so invested, the proxy gains any\nsalient divine abilities held by the patron deity as well as the powers and\nabilities of a rank 1 demigod. Without the requisite 능력치 점수 or divine\nranks, the proxy may not be able to use all those powers and abilities. A deity\nmay have more than one proxy, but it must lose 1 divine rank for each proxy it\ninvests. A deity can retrieve a single divine rank as a standard action, and\ndoing so it does not require the physical presence of the proxy. </p></section><section id=\"h3-2-petitioners\"><h3>Petitioners</h3><p>Some spirits\ndemonstrate their devotion to their deity by traveling to the deity’s home\nplane. Those that survive the journey across the planes become servants of\ntheir deity. While a few may remain disembodied spirits, most become\npetitioners through the divine will of their patron deity. </p><p>In general,\npetitioners appear in the form that they had when they died, though they may be\nremade by deities to fit the nature of their particular afterlife. In general,\npetitioners who become divine servants are creatures that originally had at\nleast 1 Intelligence and 1 Wisdom.</p><p>The following\ncreature types may become petitioners depending on the deity: aberrations,\nanimals, dragons, fey, giants, humanoids, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids,\nand plants, oozes, and vermin with sufficient 능력치 점수. Constructs and\nundead are not usually made into petitioners, though the spirits of their\noriginal forms may be. Elementals and outsiders tend to meld with their native\nplanes, and as such do not become petitioners. Their spirits may still be\ncalled back from the dead, however.</p><p>The template\npresented below is for NPCs, not player characters. If dead characters who are\npetitioners are later restored to life (once again becoming player characters),\nthey forget any of their experiences as petitioners.</p></section><section id=\"h3-3-creating-a-petitioner\"><h3>Creating a Petitioner</h3><p>“Petitioner” is a\ntemplate that may be added to any creature as determined by the nature of the\ncampaign (referred to hereafter as the base creature).
