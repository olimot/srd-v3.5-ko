An\n            antimagic effect has the following powers and characteristics.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            • No supernatural ability, spell-like ability, or spell works in an area of antimagic (but extraordinary\n            abilities still work).\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            • Antimagic does not dispel magic; it suppresses it. Once a magical effect is no longer affected by the\n            antimagic (the antimagic fades, the center of the effect moves away, and so on), the magic returns. Spells\n            that still have part of their duration left begin functioning again, magic items are once again useful, and\n            so forth.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            • Spell areas that include both an antimagic area and a normal area, but are not centered in the antimagic\n            area, still function in the normal area. If the spell’s center is in the antimagic area, then the spell is\n            suppressed.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            • Golems and other constructs, elementals, outsiders, and corporeal undead, still function in an antimagic\n            area (though the antimagic area suppresses their spellcasting and their supernatural and spell-like\n            abilities normally). If such creatures are summoned or conjured, however, see below.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            • Summoned or conjured creatures of any type, as well as incorporeal undead, wink out if they enter the area\n            of an antimagic effect.

(If she has more than one spell at her highest level, she chooses which she loses.) In\n            addition, when she next prepares spells or regains spell slots, she gets one less spell slot at her highest\n            spell level.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Negative levels remain for 24 hours or until removed with a spell, such as\n            <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">restoration. </span>After 24 hours, the afflicted creature must attempt a\n            Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 attacker’s HD + attacker’s Cha modifier).

The\n            afflicted creature makes a separate 내성 굴림 for each negative level it has gained.

The observer gains a hunch that “something’s there” but can’t see it or target it accurately\n            with an attack. A creature who is holding still is very hard to notice (DC 30). An inanimate object, an\n            unliving creature holding still, or a completely immobile creature is even harder to spot (DC 40). It’s\n            practically impossible (+20 DC) to pinpoint an invisible creature’s location with a Spot check, and even if\n            a character succeeds on such a check, the invisible creature still benefits from total concealment (50% miss\n            chance).\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A creature can use hearing to find an invisible creature. A character can make a Listen check for this\n            purpose as a free action each round. A Listen check result at least equal to the invisible creature’s Move\n            Silently check result reveals its presence. (A creature with no ranks in Move Silently makes a Move Silently\n            check as a Dexterity check to which an armor check penalty applies.) A successful check lets a character\n            hear an invisible creature “over there somewhere.” It’s practically impossible to pinpoint the location of\n            an invisible creature. A Listen check that beats the DC by 20 pinpoints the invisible creature’s location.\n          </p>\n          <div class=\"table-container\">\n            <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px;

A character can make a touch attack with his hands\n            or a weapon into two adjacent 5-foot squares using a standard action. If an invisible target is in the\n            designated area, there is a 50% miss chance on the touch attack. If successful, the groping character deals\n            no damage but has successfully pinpointed the invisible creature’s current location. (If the invisible\n            creature moves, its location, obviously, is once again unknown.)\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            If an invisible creature strikes a character, the character struck still knows the location of the creature\n            that struck him (until, of course, the invisible creature moves). The only exception is if the invisible\n            creature has a reach greater than 5 feet. In this case, the struck character knows the general location of\n            the creature but has not pinpointed the exact location.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            If a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose location he has pinpointed, he attacks normally,\n            but the invisible creature still benefits from full concealment (and thus a 50% miss chance). A particularly\n            large and slow creature might get a smaller miss chance.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            If a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose location he has not pinpointed, have the player\n            choose the space where the character will direct the attack. If the invisible creature is there, conduct the\n            attack normally. If the enemy’s not there, roll the miss chance as if it were there, don’t let the player\n            see the result, and tell him that the character has missed. That way the player doesn’t know whether the\n            attack missed because the enemy’s not there or because you successfully rolled the miss chance.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            If an invisible character picks up a visible object, the object remains visible. One could coat an invisible\n            object with flour to at least keep track of its position (until the flour fell off or blew away). An\n            invisible creature can pick up a small visible item and hide it on his person (tucked in a pocket or behind\n            a cloak) and render it effectively invisible.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Invisible creatures leave tracks. They can be tracked normally. Footprints in sand, mud, or other soft\n            surfaces can give enemies clues to an invisible creature’s location.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            An invisible creature in the water displaces water, revealing its location. The invisible creature, however,\n            is still hard to see and benefits from concealment.\n          </p>\n          <p>A creature with the scent ability can detect an invisible creature as it would a visible one.</p>\n          <p>\n            A creature with the 장님 전투 feat has a better chance to hit an invisible creature. Roll the miss chance\n            twice, and he misses only if both rolls indicate a miss. (Alternatively, make one 25% miss chance roll\n            rather than two 50% miss chance rolls.)\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A creature with blindsight can attack (and otherwise interact with) creatures regardless of 투명상태.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            An invisible burning torch still gives off light, as does an invisible object with a light spell (or similar\n            spell) cast upon it.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            무형의 creatures are invisible.

If the\n            opponent is upwind, the range is 60 feet. If it is downwind, the range is 15 feet. Strong scents, such as\n            smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above.

For each hour that the\n            trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat.

(The defender’s spell resistance is like an 방어도\n            against magical attacks.) If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn’t affect the creature. The\n            possessor does not have to do anything special to use spell resistance.

Extraordinary and supernatural\n            abilities (including enhancement bonuses on magic weapons) are not. A creature can have some abilities that\n            are subject to spell resistance and some that are not.

Doing so is a standard action that does not provoke\n            an attack of opportunity. Once a creature lowers its resistance, it remains down until the creature’s next\n            turn. At the beginning of the creature’s next turn, the creature’s spell resistance automatically returns\n            unless the creature intentionally keeps it down (also a standard action that does not provoke an attack of\n            opportunity).\n          </p>\n          <p>A creature’s spell resistance never interferes with its own spells, items, or abilities.</p>\n          <p>\n            A creature with spell resistance cannot impart this power to others by touching them or standing in their\n            midst.
