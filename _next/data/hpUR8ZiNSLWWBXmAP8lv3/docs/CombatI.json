Once a combatant acts, he or she is no\nlonger flat-footed.</p><p>2.\nDetermine which characters are aware of their opponents at the start of the\nbattle. If some but not all of the combatants are aware of their opponents, a\nsurprise round happens before regular rounds of combat begin. The combatants\nwho are aware of the opponents can act in the surprise round, so they roll for\ninitiative. In initiative order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the\nbattle aware of their opponents each take one action (either a standard action\nor a move action) during the surprise round. Combatants who were unaware do not\nget to act in the surprise round. If no one or everyone starts the battle\naware, there is no surprise round.</p><p>3.\nCombatants who have not yet rolled initiative do so. All combatants are now\nready to begin their first regular round of combat.</p><p>4.\nCombatants act in initiative order (highest to lowest).</p><p>5.\nWhen everyone has had a turn, the combatant with the highest initiative acts\nagain, and steps 4 and 5 repeat until combat ends.</p></section><section id=\"h2-2-combat-statistics\"><h2>전투 수치</h2><p>This\nsection summarizes the statistics that determine success in combat, and then\ndetails how to use</p><section id=\"h3-3-attack-roll\"><h3>명중 굴림</h3><p>An\nattack roll represents your attempt to strike your opponent on your turn in a\nround.

It’s the attack roll result that an opponent needs to\nachieve to hit you. Your AC is equal to the following: 10 + armor bonus +\nshield bonus + Dexterity modifier + size modifier</p><p>Note\nthat armor limits your Dexterity bonus, so if you’re wearing armor, you might\nnot be able to apply your whole Dexterity bonus to your AC.</p><p>Sometimes\nyou can’t use your Dexterity bonus (if you have one). If you can’t react to a\nblow, you can’t use your Dexterity bonus to AC. (If you don’t have a Dexterity\nbonus, nothing happens.)</p><p>Other\nModifiers: Many other factors modify your AC.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Enhancement\nBonuses: </span><span>Enhancement\neffects make your armor better.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Deflection\nBonus: </span><span>Magical\ndeflection effects ward off attacks and improve your AC.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Natural\nArmor: </span><span>Natural\narmor improves your AC.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dodge\nBonuses: </span><span>Some\nother AC bonuses represent actively avoiding blows. These bonuses are called\ndodge bonuses. Any situation that denies you your Dexterity bonus also denies\nyou dodge bonuses. (Wearing armor, however, does not limit these bonuses the\nway it limits a Dexterity bonus to AC.) Unlike most sorts of bonuses, dodge\nbonuses stack with each other.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Touch\nAttacks:</span><span>\nSome attacks disregard armor, including shields and natural armor. In these\ncases, the attacker makes a touch attack roll (either ranged or melee). When\nyou are the target of a touch attack, your AC doesn’t include any armor bonus,\nshield bonus, or natural armor bonus. All other modifiers, such as your size\nmodifier, Dexterity modifier, and deflection bonus (if any) apply normally.</span></p></section><section id=\"h3-7-hit-points\"><h3>히트 포인트</h3><p>When\nyour hit point total reaches 0, you’re disabled. When it reaches –1, you’re\ndying. When it gets to –10, you’re dead.</p></section><section id=\"h3-8-speed\"><h3>속도</h3><p>Your\nspeed tells you how far you can move in a round and still do something, such as\nattack or cast a spell. Your speed depends mostly on your race and what armor\nyou’re wearing.</p><p>Dwarves,\ngnomes, and halflings have a speed of 20 feet (4 squares), or 15 feet (3\nsquares) when wearing medium or heavy armor (except for dwarves, who move 20\nfeet in any armor).</p><p>Humans,\nelves, half-elves, and half-orcs have a speed of 30 feet (6 squares), or 20\nfeet (4 squares) in medium or heavy armor.</p><p>If\nyou use two move actions in a round (sometimes called a “double move” action),\nyou can move up to double your speed. If you spend the entire round to run all\nout, you can move up to quadruple your speed (or triple if you are in heavy\narmor).</p></section><section id=\"h3-9-saving-throws\"><h3>내성 굴림</h3><p>Generally,\nwhen you are subject to an unusual or magical attack, you get a saving throw to\navoid or reduce the effect. Like an attack roll, a saving throw is a d20 roll\nplus a bonus based on your class, level, and an ability score. Your saving\nthrow modifier is: Base save bonus + ability modifier </p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Saving\nThrow Types:</span><span>\nThe three different kinds of saving throws are Fortitude, Reflex, and Will:</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Fortitude:\n</span><span>These\nsaves measure your ability to stand up to physical punishment or attacks\nagainst your vitality and health. Apply your Constitution modifier to your\nFortitude saving throws. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Reflex:\n</span><span>These\nsaves test your ability to dodge area attacks. Apply your Dexterity modifier to\nyour Reflex saving throws. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Will:\n</span><span>These\nsaves reflect your resistance to mental influence as well as many magical\neffects. Apply your Wisdom modifier to your Will saving throws.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Saving\nThrow Difficulty Class:</span><span> The DC for a save is determined by the attack itself.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Automatic\nFailures and Successes:</span><span> A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a saving throw is always\na failure (and may cause damage to exposed items; see Items Surviving after a\nSaving Throw). A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a success.</span></p></section></section><section id=\"h2-10-initiative\"><h2>선제권</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Initiative\nChecks:</span><span>\nAt the start of a battle, each combatant makes an initiative check. An\ninitiative check is a Dexterity check. Each character applies his or her\nDexterity modifier to the roll. Characters act in order, counting down from\nhighest result to lowest. In every round that follows, the characters act in\nthe same order (unless a character takes an action that results in his or her\ninitiative changing; see Special Initiative Actions).</span></p><p>If\ntwo or more combatants have the same initiative check result, the combatants\nwho are tied act in order of total initiative modifier (highest first). If\nthere is still a tie, the tied characters should roll again to determine which\none of them goes before the other.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Flat-Footed:</span><span> At the start of a battle,\nbefore you have had a chance to act (specifically, before your first regular\nturn in the initiative order), you are flat-footed. You can’t use your\nDexterity bonus to AC (if any) while flat-footed. Barbarians and rogues have\nthe uncanny dodge extraordinary ability, which allows them to avoid losing\ntheir Dexterity bonus to AC due to being flat-footed.</span></p><p>A\nflat-footed character can’t make attacks of opportunity.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Inaction:</span><span> Even if you can’t take\nactions, you retain your initiative score for the duration of the encounter.</span></p><section id=\"h3-11-surprise\"><h3>기습</h3><p>When\na combat starts, if you are not aware of your opponents and they are aware of\nyou, you’re surprised.</p><p>Determining\nAwareness</p><p>Sometimes\nall the combatants on a side are aware of their opponents, sometimes none are,\nand sometimes only some of them are. Sometimes a few combatants on each side\nare aware and the other combatants on each side are unaware.</p><p>Determining\nawareness may call for Listen checks, Spot checks, or other checks.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">The\nSurprise Round:</span><span>\nIf some but not all of the combatants are aware of their opponents, a surprise\nround happens before regular rounds begin. Any combatants aware of the\nopponents can act in the surprise round, so they roll for initiative. In\ninitiative order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware\nof their opponents each take a standard action during the surprise round. You\ncan also take free actions during the surprise round. If no one or everyone is\nsurprised, no surprise round occurs.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Unaware\nCombatants:</span><span>\nCombatants who are unaware at the start of battle don’t get to act in the\nsurprise round. Unaware combatants are flat-footed because they have not acted\nyet, so they lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.</span></p></section></section><section id=\"h2-12-attacks-of-opportunity\"><h2>기회 공격</h2><p>Sometimes\na combatant in a melee lets her guard down. In this case, combatants near her\ncan take advantage of her lapse in defense to attack her for free. These free\nattacks are called attacks of opportunity.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Threatened\nSquares:</span><span>\nYou threaten all squares into which you can make a melee attack, even when it\nis not your action. Generally, that means everything in all squares adjacent to\nyour space (including diagonally). An enemy that takes certain actions while in\na threatened square provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If you’re\nunarmed, you don’t normally threaten any squares and thus can’t make attacks of\nopportunity.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Reach\nWeapons: </span><span>Most\ncreatures of Medium or smaller size have a reach of only 5 feet. This means\nthat they can make melee attacks only against creatures up to 5 feet (1 square)\naway. However, Small and Medium creatures wielding reach weapons threaten more\nsquares than a typical creature. In addition, most creatures larger than Medium\nhave a natural reach of 10 feet or more.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Provoking\nan Attack of Opportunity: </span><span>Two kinds of actions can provoke attacks of opportunity:\nmoving out of a threatened square and performing an action within a threatened\nsquare.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Moving:\n</span><span>Moving\nout of a threatened square usually provokes an attack of opportunity from the\nthreatening opponent. There are two common methods of avoiding such an\nattack—the 5-foot-step and the withdraw action (see below).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Performing\na Distracting Act: </span><span>Some actions, when performed in a threatened square, provoke\nattacks of opportunity as you divert your attention from the battle. Table:\nActions in Combat notes many of the actions that provoke attacks of\nopportunity.</span></p><p>Remember\nthat even actions that normally provoke attacks of opportunity may have\nexceptions to this rule.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Making\nan Attack of Opportunity:</span><span> An attack of opportunity is a single melee attack, and you\ncan only make one per round. You don’t have to make an attack of opportunity if\nyou don’t want to.</span></p><p>An\nexperienced character gets additional regular melee attacks (by using the full\nattack action), but at a lower attack bonus. You make your attack of\nopportunity, however, at your normal attack bonus—even if you’ve already\nattacked in the round.</p><p>An\nattack of opportunity “interrupts” the normal flow of actions in the round. If\nan attack of opportunity is provoked, immediately resolve the attack of\nopportunity, then continue with the next character’s turn (or complete the\ncurrent turn, if the attack of opportunity was provoked in the midst of a\ncharacter’s turn).</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Combat\nReflexes and Additional Attacks of Opportunity: </span><span>If you have the Combat Reflexes feat\nyou can add your Dexterity modifier to the number of attacks of opportunity you\ncan make in a round. This feat does not let you make more than one attack for a\ngiven opportunity, but if the same opponent provokes two attacks of opportunity\nfrom you, you could make two separate attacks of opportunity (since each one\nrepresents a different opportunity). Moving out of more than one square\nthreatened by the same opponent in the same round doesn’t count as more than\none opportunity for that opponent. All these attacks are at your full normal\nattack bonus.</span></p></section><section id=\"h2-13-actions-in-combat\"><h2>전투 내 행동</h2><section id=\"h3-14-the-combat-round\"><h3>전투 라운드</h3><p>Each\nround represents 6 seconds in the game world. A round presents an opportunity\nfor each character involved in a combat situation to take an action. </p><p>Each\nround’s activity begins with the character with the highest initiative result\nand then proceeds, in order, from there. Each round of a combat uses the same\ninitiative order. When a character’s turn comes up in the initiative sequence,\nthat character performs his entire round’s worth of actions. (For exceptions,\nsee Attacks of Opportunity and Special Initiative Actions.)</p><p>For\nalmost all purposes, there is no relevance to the end of a round or the\nbeginning of a round. A round can be a segment of game time starting with the\nfirst character to act and ending with the last, but it usually means a span of\ntime from one round to the same initiative count in the next round. Effects\nthat last a certain number of rounds end just before the same initiative count\nthat they began on.</p></section><section id=\"h3-15-action-types\"><h3>행동 유형</h3><p>An\naction’s type essentially tells you how long the action takes to perform (within\nthe framework of the 6-second combat round) and how movement is treated. There\nare four types of actions: standard actions, move actions, full-round actions,\nand free actions.</p><p>In\na normal round, you can perform a standard action and a move action, or you can\nperform a full-round action. You can also perform one or more free actions. You\ncan always take a move action in place of a standard action.</p><p>In\nsome situations (such as in a surprise round), you may be limited to taking\nonly a single move action or standard action.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Standard\nAction:</span><span> A\nstandard action allows you to do something, most commonly make an attack or\ncast a spell. See Table: Actions in Combat for other standard actions.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Move\nAction:</span><span> A\nmove action allows you to move your speed or perform an action that takes a\nsimilar amount of time. See Table: Actions in Combat.</span></p><p>You\ncan take a move action in place of a standard action. If you move no actual\ndistance in a round (commonly because you have swapped your move for one or\nmore equivalent actions), you can take one 5-foot step either before, during,\nor after the action.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Full-Round\nAction:</span><span> A\nfull-round action consumes all your effort during a round. The only movement\nyou can take during a full-round action is a 5-foot step before, during, or\nafter the action. You can also perform free actions (see below).</span></p><p>Some\nfull-round actions do not allow you to take a 5-foot step.</p><p>Some\nfull-round actions can be taken as standard actions, but only in situations\nwhen you are limited to performing only a standard action during your round.\nThe descriptions of specific actions, below, detail which actions allow this\noption.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Free\nAction:</span><span>\nFree actions consume a very small amount of time and effort. You can perform\none or more free actions while taking another action normally. However, there\nare reasonable limits on what you can really do for free.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Not\nan Action:</span><span>\nSome activities are so minor that they are not even considered free actions.\nThey literally don’t take any time at all to do and are considered an inherent\npart of doing something else.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Restricted\nActivity:</span><span>\nIn some situations, you may be unable to take a full round’s worth of actions.\nIn such cases, you are restricted to taking only a single standard action or a\nsingle move action (plus free actions as normal). You can’t take a full-round\naction (though you can start or complete a full-round action by using a\nstandard action; see below).</span></p><div class=\"table-container\"><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

(Opponents\nwithin 5 feet are considered adjacent to you.) Some melee weapons have reach,\nas indicated in their descriptions. With a typical reach weapon, you can strike\nopponents 10 feet away, but you can’t strike adjacent foes (those within 5\nfeet).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Unarmed\nAttacks:</span><span>\nStriking for damage with punches, kicks, and head butts is much like attacking\nwith a melee weapon, except for the following:</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Attacks\nof Opportunity: </span><span>Attacking\nunarmed provokes an attack of opportunity from the character you attack,\nprovided she is armed. The attack of opportunity comes before your attack. An\nunarmed attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity from other foes nor does\nit provoke an attack of opportunity from an unarmed foe.</span></p><p>An\nunarmed character can’t take attacks of opportunity (but see “Armed” Unarmed\nAttacks, below).</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Armed”\nUnarmed Attacks: </span><span>Sometimes a character’s or creature’s unarmed attack counts\nas an armed attack. A monk, a character with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat,\na spellcaster delivering a touch attack spell, and a creature with natural\nphysical weapons all count as being armed.</span></p><p>Note\nthat being armed counts for both offense and defense (the character can make\nattacks of opportunity)</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Unarmed\nStrike Damage: </span><span>An\nunarmed strike from a Medium character deals 1d3 points of damage (plus your\nStrength modifier, as normal). A Small character’s unarmed strike deals 1d2\npoints of damage, while a Large character’s unarmed strike deals 1d4 points of\ndamage. All damage from unarmed strikes is nonlethal damage. Unarmed strikes\ncount as light weapons (for purposes of two-weapon attack penalties and so on).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dealing\nLethal Damage: </span><span>You\ncan specify that your unarmed strike will deal lethal damage before you make\nyour attack roll, but you take a –4 penalty on your attack roll. If you have\nthe Improved Unarmed Strike feat, you can deal lethal damage with an unarmed\nstrike without taking a penalty on the attack roll.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Ranged\nAttacks:</span><span>\nWith a ranged weapon, you can shoot or throw at any target that is within the\nweapon’s maximum range and in line of sight. The maximum range for a thrown\nweapon is five range increments. For projectile weapons, it is ten range\nincrements. Some ranged weapons have shorter maximum ranges, as specified in\ntheir descriptions.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Attack\nRolls:</span><span> An\nattack roll represents your attempts to strike your opponent. </span></p><p>Your\nattack roll is 1d20 + your attack bonus with the weapon you’re using. If the\nresult is at least as high as the target’s AC, you hit and deal damage.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Automatic\nMisses and Hits:</span><span>\nA natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on the attack roll is always a miss. A natural\n20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a hit. A natural 20 is also a threat—a\npossible critical hit.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Damage\nRolls:</span><span> If\nthe attack roll result equals or exceeds the target’s AC, the attack hits and\nyou deal damage. Roll the appropriate damage for your weapon. Damage is\ndeducted from the target’s current hit points.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Multiple\nAttacks:</span><span>\nA character who can make more than one attack per round must use the full\nattack action (see Full-Round Actions, below) in order to get more than one\nattack.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Shooting\nor Throwing into a Melee:</span><span> If you shoot or throw a ranged weapon at a target engaged in\nmelee with a friendly character, you take a –4 penalty on your attack roll. Two\ncharacters are engaged in melee if they are enemies of each other and either\nthreatens the other. (An unconscious or otherwise immobilized character is not\nconsidered engaged unless he is actually being attacked.)</span></p><p>If\nyour target (or the part of your target you’re aiming at, if it’s a big target)\nis at least 10 feet away from the nearest friendly character, you can avoid the\n–4 penalty, even if the creature you’re aiming at is engaged in melee with a\nfriendly character.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Precise\nShot: </span><span>If\nyou have the Precise Shot feat you don’t take this penalty.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Fighting\nDefensively as a Standard Action:</span><span> You can choose to fight defensively when attacking.\nIf you do so, you take a –4 penalty on all attacks in a round to gain a +2\ndodge bonus to AC for the same round.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Critical\nHits:</span><span>\nWhen you make an attack roll and get a natural 20 (the d20 shows 20), you hit\nregardless of your target’s Armor Class, and you have scored a threat. The hit\nmight be a critical hit (or “crit”). To find out if it’s a critical hit, you\nimmediately make a critical roll—another attack roll with all the same\nmodifiers as the attack roll you just made. If the critical roll also results\nin a hit against the target’s AC, your original hit is a critical hit. (The\ncritical roll just needs to hit to give you a crit. It doesn’t need to come up\n20 again.) If the critical roll is a miss, then your hit is just a regular hit.</span></p><p>A critical hit\nmeans that you roll your damage more than once, with all your usual bonuses,\nand add the rolls together. Unless otherwise specified, the threat range for a\ncritical hit on an attack roll is 20, and the multiplier is x2.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Exception:</span><span>Extra damage over and\nabove a weapon’s normal damage is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Increased\nThreat Range:</span><span>Sometimes\nyour threat range is greater than 20. That is, you can score a threat on a\nlower number. In such cases, a roll of lower than 20 is not an automatic hit.\nAny attack roll that doesn’t result in a hit is not a threat.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Increased\nCritical Multiplier:</span><span>Some weapons deal better than double damage on a critical\nhit.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Spells\nand Critical Hits: </span><span>A spell that requires an attack rollcan score a\ncritical hit. A spell attack that requires no attack rollcannot score a\ncritical hit.</span></p></section><section id=\"h5-18-cast-a-spell\"><h5>주문 시전</h5><p>Most\nspells require 1 standard action to cast. You can cast such a spell either\nbefore or after you take a move action. </p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Note:\n</span><span>You\nretain your Dexterity bonus to AC while casting.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Spell\nComponents:</span><span>\nTo cast a spell with a verbal (V) component, your character must speak in a\nfirm voice. If you’re gagged or in the area of a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">silence </span>spell, you\ncan’t cast such a spell. A spellcaster who has been deafened has a 20% chance\nto spoil any spell he tries to cast if that spell has a verbal component.</span></p><p>To\ncast a spell with a somatic (S) component, you must gesture freely with at\nleast one hand. You can’t cast a spell of this type while bound, grappling, or\nwith both your hands full or occupied.</p><p>To\ncast a spell with a material (M), focus (F), or divine focus (DF) component,\nyou have to have the proper materials, as described by the spell. Unless these\nmaterials are elaboratepreparing these materials is a free action. For\nmaterial components and focuses whose costs are not listed, you can assume that\nyou have them if you have your spell component pouch.</p><p>Some spells have\nan experience point (XP) component and entail an experience point cost to you.\nNo spell can restore the lost XP. You cannot spend so much XP that you lose a\nlevel, so you cannot cast the spell unless you have enough XP to spare.\nHowever, you may, on gaining enough XP to achieve a new level, immediately\nspend the XP on casting the spell rather than keeping it to advance a level.\nThe XP are expended when you cast the spell, whether or not the casting\nsucceeds.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Concentration:</span><span> You must concentrate to\ncast a spell. If you can’t concentrate you can’t cast a spell. If you start\ncasting a spell but something interferes with your concentration you must make\na Concentration check or lose the spell. The check’s DC depends on what is\nthreatening your concentration (see the Concentration skill). If you fail, the\nspell fizzles with no effect. If you prepare spells, it is lost from\npreparation. If you cast at will, it counts against your daily limit of spells\neven though you did not cast it successfully.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Concentrating\nto Maintain a Spell:</span><span> Some spells require continued concentration to keep them\ngoing. Concentrating to maintain a spell is a standard action that doesn’t\nprovoke an attack of opportunity. Anything that could break your concentration\nwhen casting a spell can keep you from concentrating to maintain a spell. If\nyour concentration breaks, the spell ends.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Casting\nTime:</span><span>\nMost spells have a casting time of 1 standard action. A spell cast in this\nmanner immediately takes effect.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Attacks\nof Opportunity:</span><span>\nGenerally, if you cast a spell, you provoke attacks of opportunity from\nthreatening enemies. If you take damage from an attack of opportunity, you must\nmake a Concentration check (DC 10 + points of damage taken + spell level) or\nlose the spell. Spells that require only a free action to cast don’t provoke\nattacks of opportunity.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Casting\non the Defensive:</span><span> Casting a spell while on the defensive does not provoke an\nattack of opportunity. It does, however, require a Concentration check (DC 15 +\nspell level) to pull off. Failure means that you lose the spell.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Touch\nSpells in Combat:</span><span> Many spells have a range of touch. To use these spells, you\ncast the spell and then touch the subject, either in the same round or any time\nlater. In the same round that you cast the spell, you may also touch (or\nattempt to touch) the target. You may take your move before casting the spell,\nafter touching the target, or between casting the spell and touching the\ntarget. You can automatically touch one friend or use the spell on yourself,\nbut to touch an opponent, you must succeed on an attack roll.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Touch\nAttacks: </span><span>Touching\nan opponent with a touch spell is considered to be an armed attack and\ntherefore does not provoke attacks of opportunity. However, the act of casting\na spell does provoke an attack of opportunity. Touch attacks come in two types:\nmelee touch attacks and ranged touch attacks. You can score critical hits with\neither type of attack. Your opponent’s AC against a touch attack does not\ninclude any armor bonus, shield bonus, or natural armor bonus. His size\nmodifier, Dexterity modifier, and deflection bonus (if any) all apply normally.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Holding\nthe Charge: </span><span>If\nyou don’t discharge the spell in the round when you cast the spell, you can\nhold the discharge of the spell (hold the charge) indefinitely. You can\ncontinue to make touch attacks round after round. You can touch one friend as a\nstandard action or up to six friends as a full-round action. If you touch\nanything or anyone while holding a charge, even unintentionally, the spell\ndischarges. If you cast another spell, the touch spell dissipates.\nAlternatively, you may make a normal unarmed attack (or an attack with a\nnatural weapon) while holding a charge. In this case, you aren’t considered\narmed and you provoke attacks of opportunity as normal for the attack. (If your\nunarmed attack or natural weapon attack doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity,\nneither does this attack.) If the attack hits, you deal normal damage for your\nunarmed attack or natural weapon and the spell discharges. If the attack\nmisses, you are still holding the charge.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Dismiss\na Spell:</span><span>\nDismissing an active spell is a standard action that doesn’t provoke attacks of\nopportunity.</span></p></section><section id=\"h5-19-activate-magic-item\"><h5>마법 아이템 사용</h5><p>Many\nmagic items don’t need to be activated. However, certain magic items need to be\nactivated, especially potions, scrolls, wands, rods, and staffs. Activating a\nmagic item is a standard action (unless the item description indicates\notherwise).</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Spell\nCompletion Items: </span><span>Activating a spell completion item is the equivalent of\ncasting a spell. It requires concentration and provokes attacks of opportunity.\nYou lose the spell if your concentration is broken, and you can attempt to\nactivate the item while on the defensive, as with casting a spell.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Spell\nTrigger, Command Word, or Use-Activated Items: </span><span>Activating any of these kinds of\nitems does not require concentration and does not provoke attacks of\nopportunity.</span></p></section><section id=\"h5-20-use-special-ability\"><h5>특수 능력 사용</h5><p>Using\na special ability is usually a standard action, but whether it is a standard\naction, a full-round action, or not an action at all is defined by the ability.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Spell-Like\nAbilities:</span><span>\nUsing a spell-like ability works like casting a spell in that it requires\nconcentration and provokes attacks of opportunity. Spell-like abilities can be\ndisrupted. If your concentration is broken, the attempt to use the ability\nfails, but the attempt counts as if you had used the ability. The casting time\nof a spell-like ability is 1 standard action, unless the ability description\nnotes otherwise.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Using\na Spell-Like Ability on the Defensive: </span><span>You may attempt to use a spell-like\nability on the defensive, just as with casting a spell. If the Concentration\ncheck (DC 15 + spell level) fails, you can’t use the ability, but the attempt\ncounts as if you had used the ability.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Supernatural\nAbilities:</span><span>\nUsing a supernatural ability is usually a standard action (unless defined\notherwise by the ability’s description). Its use cannot be disrupted, does not\nrequire concentration, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Extraordinary\nAbilities:</span><span>\nUsing an extraordinary ability is usually not an action because most\nextraordinary abilities automatically happen in a reactive fashion. Those\nextraordinary abilities that are actions are usually standard actions that\ncannot be disrupted, do not require concentration, and do not provoke attacks\nof opportunity.</span></p></section><section id=\"h5-21-total-defense\"><h5>총력 방어</h5><p>You\ncan defend yourself as a standard action.

Note that this isn’t the\nsame as a spell with a 1-round casting time—the spell takes effect in the same\nround that you begin casting, and you aren’t required to continue the\ninvocations, gestures, and concentration until your next turn.

In such a case, you may\nspend a full-round action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any direction, even\ndiagonally.
