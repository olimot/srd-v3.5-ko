A full deck consists of\n            thirty-four cards. When a card is drawn at random and thrown to the ground, a\n            <i>상급 환영 </i>of a creature is formed. The figment lasts until\n            dispelled. The illusory creature cannot 이동 more than 30 feet away from where the card landed, but\n            otherwise 이동 and acts as if it were real. At all times it obeys the desires of the character who drew the\n            card. When 환영술 is dispelled, the card becomes blank and cannot be used again. If the card is picked up,\n            환영술 is automatically and instantly dispelled. The cards in a deck and 환영술 they bring forth are\n            summarized on the following table. (Use one of the first two columns to simulate the contents of a full deck\n            using either ordinary playing cards or tarot cards.)</span>\n        </p>\n        <div class=\"table-container\">\n          <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 44.4751em\">\n            <tbody style=\"vertical-align: middle\">\n              <tr>\n                <td style=\"width: 9.45em\">Playing Card</td>\n                <td style=\"width: 10.275em\">Tarot Card</td>\n                <td style=\"width: 17.25em\">Creature</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td style=\"width: 9.45em\">Ace of hearts</td>\n                <td style=\"width: 10.275em\">IV.
