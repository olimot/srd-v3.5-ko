Weapon 거리 are halved. A character의 근력\n            and 민첩 scores are not affected.

Such a plane has no gravity for unattended objects and nonsentient creatures.\n            This sort of 환경 can be very disorienting to the newcomer, but is common on “weightless” 이세계.</span>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Characters on a plane with subjective directional gravity can 이동 normally along a solid surface by imagining\n          “down” near their feet. If suspended in midair, a character “flies” by merely choosing a “down” direction and\n          “낙하” that way. Under such a procedure, an individual “falls” 150 feet in the first round and 300 feet in\n          each succeeding round. 이동 is straight-line only. In order to stop, one has to slow one의 이동 by changing\n          the designated “down” direction (again, moving 150 feet in the new direction in the first round and 300 feet\n          per round thereafter).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          It takes a DC 16 지혜 check to set a new direction of gravity as a free action; this check can be made once\n          per round.

Time is always subjective for the viewer. The same subjectivity applies to various 이세계. Travelers\n            may discover that they’ll pick up or lose time while moving among 이세계, but from their point of view, time\n            always passes naturally.</span>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <i>Normal Time: </i><span>This trait describes the way time passes on 물질 세계.

Everything on the plane returned to is only\n            a few seconds older.

Worse yet, individuals without the ability to burrow are entombed\n            in the earth and must dig their way out (5 feet per turn).
