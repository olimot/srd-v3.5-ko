Depending on the version\nselected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of\ncombat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Sustained\nForce: </span><span>A\nsustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster\nlevel (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature\ncan negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or\nwith spell resistance.</span></p><p>This\nversion of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you\ncease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in\nboth directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if\nthe object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any\nreason, the object falls or stops.</p><p>An\nobject can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a\nlever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on,\nif the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able\nto untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require\nIntelligence checks.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Combat\nManeuver: </span><span>Alternatively,\nonce per round, you can use <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">telekinesis </span>to perform a bull rush, disarm,\ngrapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that\nthey don’t provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place\nof your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use your Intelligence\nmodifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your\nStrength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn’t allow a reactive\nattempt by the target (such as for disarm or trip). No save is allowed against\nthese attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell\ncan last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Violent\nThrust: </span><span>Alternatively,\nthe spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or\ncreature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10\nfeet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the\nobjects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level\n(maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).</span></p><p>You\nmust succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the\ntarget with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence\nmodifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause\nstandard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage\nas daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage\nranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points\nof damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).</p><p>Creatures\nwho fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are\nallowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those\nwhose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is\nhurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet\n(1d6 points).</p></section><section id=\"h3-2-telekinetic-sphere\"><h3>Telekinetic Sphere</h3><p>Evocation\n[Force]</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Level:</span><span> Sor/Wiz 8</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Components:</span><span> V, S, M</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Casting\nTime:</span><span> 1\nstandard action</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Range:</span><span> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2\nlevels)</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Effect:</span><span> 1-ft.-diameter/level\nsphere, centered around creatures or objects</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Duration:</span><span> 1 min./level (D)</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Saving\nThrow:</span><span>\nReflex negates (object)</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Spell\nResistance:</span><span>\nYes (object)</span></p><p>This\nspell functions like <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">resilient sphere, </span>with the addition that the\ncreatures or objects inside the globe are nearly weightless.

When traveling to a\nfalse destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than\nrolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or\neven be off target from.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">On\nTarget: </span><span>You\nappear where you want to be.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Off\nTarget: </span><span>You\nappear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random\ndirection.

For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature\nmoves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). Of\ncourse, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as\ndescribed above.
