Some spellcasters select their 주문 from a\n        limited list of 주문 known, while others have access to a wide variety of options.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Most spellcasters prepare their 주문 in advance—whether from a spellbook or through devout 기도 and meditation—\n        while some cast 주문 spontaneously without preparation.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Despite these different ways that characters use to learn or prepare their 주문, when it comes to casting them,\n        주문 are very much alike.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Cutting across the categories of arcane and 신성 주문 are the eight 학파 of magic.

If you’re a 사제, 드루이드, experienced 성기사, experienced\n            레인저, or 마법사, you select from among 주문 prepared earlier in the day and not yet cast (see 마법사 주문\n            준비 and 신성 주문 준비).\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            If you’re a 음유시인 or 소서러, you can select any spell you know, provided you are capable of 주문 시전하기\n            of that 레벨 or higher.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            To 주문 시전, you must be able to 말하기(if the spell has a verbal component), gesture (if it has a somatic\n            component), and manipulate the material 구성요소 or focus (if any).

If you’re a 음유시인 or 소서러, casting a\n            spell counts against your daily limit for 주문 of that spell 레벨, but you can cast the same spell again if\n            you haven’t reached your limit.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n        <section id=\"h3-3-concentration\">\n          <h3>집중</h3>\n          <div class=\"original-headline\">CONCENTRATION</div>\n          <p>\n            To 주문 시전, you must concentrate.

By doing so, you are using the spell’s energy to disrupt\n            the casting of the same spell by another character. Counterspelling works even if one spell is 신성 and the\n            other arcane.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>How 주문 무효화 Work: </b><span>To use a counterspell, you must select an opponent as the target of the counterspell. You do this by\n              choosing 준비 action. In doing so, you elect to wait to complete your action until your opponent tries to\n              주문 시전. (You may still 이동 your 속도, since 준비 is a standard action.)</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            If the target of your counterspell tries to 주문 시전, make a 주문학 check (DC 15 + the spell’s 레벨). This\n            check is a free action. If the check succeeds, you correctly 식별 the opponent’s spell and can attempt to\n            counter it. If the check fails, you can’t do either of these things.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            To complete the action, you must then cast the correct spell. As a general rule, a spell can only counter\n            itself. If you are able to cast the same spell and you have it prepared (if you prepare 주문), you cast it,\n            altering it slightly to create a counterspell effect. If the target is within 거리, both 주문 automatically\n            negate each other with no other results.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Counterspelling 메타마법 주문:</b><span> 메타마법 특기 are not taken into account when determining whether a spell can be countered</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Specific Exceptions:</b><span>\n              Some 주문 specifically counter each other, especially when they have diametrically opposed effects.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: 700\">마법 무효화 </span><b>as a Counterspell:</b><span>\n              You can use <i>마법 무효화 </i>to counterspell another spellcaster, and\n              you don’t need to 식별 the spell he or she is casting.

The important aspect of 보너스\n              types is that two 보너스 of the same type don’t generally stack. With the exception of 회피 보너스, most\n              circumstance 보너스, and racial 보너스, only the better 보너스 works (see 주문 효과 조합하기, below). The\n              same principle applies to 페널티—a character taking two or more 페널티 of the same type applies only the\n              worst one.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Bringing Back 죽음:</b><span> Several 주문 have the power to restore slain characters to life.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            When a living creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves 물질 세계, travels through 영적 세계, and\n            goes to abide on the plane where the creature’s deity resides. If the creature did not worship a deity, its\n            soul departs to the plane corresponding to its 성향. Bringing someone back from 죽음 means retrieving his or\n            her soul and returning it to his or her body.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <i>레벨 손실: </i><span>Any creature brought back to life usually loses one 레벨 of experience. The character’s new XP total is\n              midway between the minimum needed for his or her new (reduced) 레벨 and the minimum needed for the next\n              one. If the character was 1 레벨 at the time of death, he or she loses 2 points of 건강 instead of losing\n              a 레벨.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            This 레벨 손실 or 건강 loss cannot be repaired by any mortal means, even\n            <i>소원 </i>or <i>기적. </i>A revived\n            character can regain a lost 레벨 by earning XP through further adventuring. A revived character who was 1\n            레벨 at the time of death can regain lost points of 건강 by improving his or her 건강 score when he or she\n            attains a 레벨 that allows an ability score increase.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <i>Preventing Revivification: </i><span>Enemies can take steps to make it more difficult for a character to be returned from 죽음.

The effect can extend around corners and into 범위 that you can’t see. Figure distance by\n              actual distance traveled, taking into account turns the spell effect takes. When determining distance for\n              spread effects, count around 벽, not through them. As with 이동, do not trace diagonals across corners.\n              You must designate the point of origin for such an effect, but you need not have line of effect (see\n              below) to all portions of the effect.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>범위:</b><span>\n              Some 주문 affect an 범위.

The point of origin of a spell is always a grid\n            intersection. When determining whether a given creature is within 범위 of a spell, count out the distance\n            from the point of origin in squares just as you do when moving a character or when determining the 거리 for\n            a ranged 공격. The only difference is that instead of counting from the center of one square to the center\n            of the next, you count from intersection to intersection.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            You can count diagonally across a square, but remember that every second diagonal counts as 2 squares of\n            distance. If the far edge of a square is within the spell’s 범위, anything within that square is within the\n            spell’s 범위. If the spell’s 범위 only touches the near edge of a square, however, anything within that\n            square is unaffected by the spell.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <i>폭발, Emanation, or Spread: </i><span>Most 주문 that affect an 범위 function as a 폭발, an emanation, or a spread.

It can’t\n            affect creatures with total 엄폐 from its point of origin (in other words, its effects don’t extend around\n            corners). The default shape for a 폭발 effect is a sphere, but some 폭발 주문 are specifically described as\n            cone-shaped. A 폭발’s 범위 defines how far from the point of origin the spell’s effect extends.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            An emanation spell functions like a 폭발 spell, except that the effect continues to radiate from the point\n            of origin for 지속시간 of the spell. Most emanations are cones or spheres.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A spread spell spreads out like a 폭발 but can turn corners. You select the point of origin, and the spell\n            spreads out a given distance in all directions. Figure 범위 the spell effect fills by taking into account\n            any turns the spell effect takes.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <i>Cone, Cylinder, Line, or Sphere: </i><span>Most 주문 that affect an 범위 have a particular shape, such as a cone, cylinder, line, or sphere.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A cone-shaped spell shoots away from you in a quarter-circle in the direction you designate. It starts from\n            any corner of your square and widens out as it goes. Most cones are either 폭발 or emanations (see above),\n            and thus won’t go around corners.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            When casting a cylinder-shaped spell, you select the spell’s point of origin. This point is the center of a\n            horizontal circle, and the spell shoots down from the circle, filling a cylinder. A cylinder-shaped spell\n            ignores any obstructions within its 범위.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A line-shaped spell shoots away from you in a line in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner\n            of your square and extends to the limit of its 거리 or until it strikes a barrier that blocks line of\n            effect.

If she wants to prepare all\n              her 주문, the process takes 1 hour. Preparing some smaller portion of her daily capacity takes a\n              proportionally smaller amount of time, but always at least 15 minutes, the minimum time required to\n              achieve the proper mental state.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Spell Selection and Preparation:</b><span>\n              Until she prepares 주문 from her spellbook, the only 주문 a 마법사 has available to cast are the ones that\n              she already had prepared from the previous day and has not yet used. During the study period, she chooses\n              which 주문 to prepare. If a 마법사 already has 주문 prepared (from the previous day) that she has not\n              cast, she can abandon some or all of them to make room for 새로운 주문.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            When preparing 주문 for the day, a 마법사 can leave some of these spell slots open. Later during that day,\n            she can repeat the preparation process as often as she likes, time and circumstances permitting. During\n            these extra sessions of preparation, 마법사 can fill these unused spell slots. She cannot, however, abandon\n            a previously prepared spell to replace it with another one or fill a slot that is empty because she has 주문\n            시전 in the meantime. That sort of preparation requires a mind fresh from rest. Like the first session of\n            the day, this preparation takes at least 15 minutes, and it takes longer if 마법사 prepares more than\n            one-quarter of her 주문.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Spell Slots:</b><span>\n              The various character class tables show how many 주문 of each 레벨 a character can cast per day. These\n              openings for daily 주문 are called spell slots. A spellcaster always has the option to fill a higher-레벨\n              spell slot with a lower-레벨 spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high enough ability score to cast 주문 that\n              would otherwise be his or her due still gets the slots but must fill them with 주문 of lower 레벨.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Prepared Spell Retention:</b><span>\n              Once a 마법사 prepares a spell, it remains in her mind as a nearly cast spell until she uses the\n              prescribed 구성요소 to complete and 트리거 it or until she abandons it.

If the skill check fails, the\n            character cannot attempt to read that particular spell again until the next day.

Once a spell from another spellcaster’s book is deciphered, the reader must make a\n            주문학 check (DC 15 + spell’s 레벨) to prepare the spell. If the check succeeds, 마법사 can prepare the\n            spell. She must repeat the check to prepare the spell again, no matter how many times she has prepared it\n            before.

To prepare a 신성 spell, a character must have a 지혜 score of\n            10 + the spell’s 레벨.

However, a 신성\n              spellcaster does not require a period of rest to prepare 주문. Instead, the character chooses a particular\n              part of the day to pray and receive 주문. The time is usually associated with some daily event. If some\n              event prevents a character from praying at the proper time, he must do so as soon as possible. If the\n              character does not stop to pray for 주문 at the first opportunity, he must wait until the next day to\n              prepare 주문.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Spell Selection and Preparation:</b><span>\n              A 신성 spellcaster selects and prepares 주문 ahead of time through 기도 and meditation at a particular\n              time of day. The time required to prepare 주문 is the same as it is for a 마법사(1 hour), as is the\n              requirement for a relatively peaceful 환경. A 신성 spellcaster does not have to prepare all his 주문 at\n              once. However, the character’s mind is considered fresh only during his or her first daily spell\n              preparation, so a 신성 spellcaster cannot fill a slot that is empty because he or she has 주문 시전 or\n              abandoned a previously prepared spell.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            신성 spellcasters do not require spellbooks. However, such a character’s spell selection is limited to the\n            주문 on the list for his or her class. 사제, 드루이드, 성기사, and 레인저 have separate spell lists. A 사제\n            also has access to two domains determined during his character creation. Each domain gives him access to a\n            domain spell at each spell 레벨 from 1st to 9th, as well as a special granted power. With access to two\n            domain 주문 at each spell 레벨—one from each of his two domains—a 사제 must prepare, as an 추가 계열 spell,\n            one or the other each day for each 레벨 of spell he can cast. If a domain spell is not on 사제 spell list,\n            it can be prepared only in a domain spell slot.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Spell Slots:</b><span> The character class tables show how many 주문 of each 레벨 a character can cast per day.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            These openings for daily 주문 are called spell slots. A spellcaster always has the option to fill a\n            higher-레벨 spell slot with a lower 레벨 spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high enough ability score to cast\n            주문 that would otherwise be his or her due still gets the slots but must fill them with 주문 of lower 레벨.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Recent Casting Limit:</b><span>\n              As with 비전 주문, at the time of preparation any 주문 cast within the previous 8 hours count against the\n              number of 주문 that can be prepared.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Spontaneous Casting of <span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: 700\">Cure </span>and\n              <span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: 700\">Inflict </span>주문:</b><span>\n              A good 사제(or a 사제 of a good deity) can spontaneously cast a\n              <i>cure </i>spell in place of a prepared spell of the same 레벨 or\n              higher, but not in place of a domain spell.
