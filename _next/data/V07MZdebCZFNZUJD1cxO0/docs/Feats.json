Regardless of the type of\n            items they involve, the various 아이템 제작 특기 all have certain features in common.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>XP Cost:</b><span>\n              Experience that the spellcaster would normally keep is expended when making a magic item. The XP cost\n              equals 1/25 of the cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he\n              or she loses a 레벨. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new 레벨, he or she can immediately\n              expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance a 레벨.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Raw Materials Cost:</b><span> The cost of creating a magic item equals one-half the sale cost of the item.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Using an item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or magical workshop, special tools, and so\n            on. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Time:</b><span>\n              The time to create a magic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one\n              day.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Item Cost:</b><span>\n              포션 제조, 마법막대 제작, and 마법두루마리 제작 create items that directly reproduce spell effects, and\n              the power of these items depends on their 시전자 레벨—that is, a spell from such an item has the power it\n              would have if cast by a spellcaster of that 레벨. The price of these items (and thus the XP cost and the\n              cost of the raw materials) also depends on 시전자 레벨. 시전자 레벨 must be high enough that the\n              spellcaster creating the item can cast the spell at that 레벨. To find the final price in each case,\n              multiply 시전자 레벨 by the spell 레벨, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below:</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <i>두루마리: </i><span>Base price = spell 레벨 x 시전자 레벨 x 25 gp.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <i>Potions: </i><span>Base price = spell 레벨 x 시전자 레벨 x 50 gp.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <i>마법막대: </i><span>Base price = spell 레벨 x 시전자 레벨 x 750 gp.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>A 0-레벨 spell is considered to have a spell 레벨 of 1/2 for 목적 of this calculation.</p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Extra Costs: </b><span>Any potion, scroll, or wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also\n              carries a commensurate cost. For potions and 두루마리, the creator must expend the material component or\n              pay the XP cost when creating the item.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            For a wand, the creator must expend fifty copies of the material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.\n          </p>\n          <p>Some 마법 아이템 similarly incur extra costs in material 구성요소 or XP, as noted in their 묘사.</p>\n        </section>\n        <section id=\"h3-5-metamagic-feats\">\n          <h3>메타마법 특기</h3>\n          <div class=\"original-headline\">METAMAGIC FEATS</div>\n          <p>\n            As a spellcaster’s 지식 of magic grows, she can learn to cast 주문 in ways slightly different from the ways\n            in which 주문 were originally designed or learned. Preparing and casting a spell in such a way is harder\n            than normal but, thanks to 메타마법 특기, at least it is possible.&nbsp; 주문 modified by a 메타마법 feat\n            use a spell slot higher than normal. This does not change 레벨 of the spell, so the DC for 내성 굴림 against\n            it does not go up.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>마법사 and 신성 Spellcasters:</b><span>\n              마법사 and 신성 spellcasters must prepare their 주문 in advance. During preparation, the character chooses\n              which 주문 to prepare with 메타마법 특기(and thus which ones take up higher-레벨 spell slots than\n              normal).</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>소서러와 음유시인:</b><span>\n              소서러와 음유시인 choose 주문 as they cast them. They can choose when they cast their 주문 whether to\n              apply their 메타마법 특기 to improve them. As with other spellcasters, the improved spell uses up a\n              higher-레벨 spell slot. But because 소서러 or 음유시인 has not prepared the spell in a 메타마법 form in\n              advance, he must apply 메타마법 feat on 감지. Therefore, such a character must also take more time to cast\n              a 메타마법 spell (one enhanced by a 메타마법 feat) than he does to cast a regular spell. If the spell’s\n              normal 시전 시간 is 1 action, casting a 메타마법 version is a full-round action for a 소서러 or 음유시인.\n              (This isn’t the same as a 1-round 시전 시간.)</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>For a spell with a longer 시전 시간, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the spell.</p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Spontaneous Casting and 메타마법 특기: </b><span>A 사제 spontaneously casting a <i>cure </i>or\n              <i>inflict </i>spell can cast a 메타마법 version of it instead. Extra\n              time is also required in this case. Casting a 1-action 메타마법 spell spontaneously is a full-round\n              action, and a spell with a longer 시전 시간 takes an extra full-round action to cast.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Effects of 메타마법 특기 on a Spell:</b><span>\n              In all ways, a 메타마법 spell operates at its original spell 레벨, even though it is prepared and cast as\n              a higher-레벨 spell. 내성 굴림 modifications are not changed unless stated otherwise in the feat\n              묘사.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The modifications made by these 특기 only apply to 주문 cast directly by the feat user. A spellcaster can’t\n            use a 메타마법 feat to alter a spell being cast from a wand, scroll, or other device.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            메타마법 특기 that eliminate 구성요소 of a spell don’t eliminate 공격 of opportunity provoked by casting a\n            spell while threatened. However, casting a spell modified by 빠른 주문 does not provoke an 공격 of\n            opportunity.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            메타마법 특기 cannot be used with all 주문. See the specific 특기 설명 for 주문 that a particular feat can’t\n            modify.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Multiple 메타마법 특기 on a Spell:</b><span>\n              A spellcaster can apply multiple 메타마법 특기 to a single spell. Changes to its 레벨 are cumulative. You\n              can’t apply the same 메타마법 feat more than once to a single spell.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>마법 아이템 and 메타마법 주문:</b><span>\n              With the right item creation feat, you can store a 메타마법 version of a spell in a scroll, potion, or\n              wand. 레벨 limits for potions and 마법막대 apply to the spell’s higher spell 레벨(after the application of\n              메타마법 feat).

In order to take into account\n              negative 매력 수정치, this table allows for very low 리더십 scores, but the character must still be 6th\n              레벨 or higher in order to gain 리더십 feat. Outside factors can affect a character’s 리더십 score, as\n              detailed above.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <i>Cohort 레벨: </i><span>The character can attract a cohort of up to this 레벨. Regardless of a character’s 리더십 score, he can\n              only recruit a cohort who is two or more 레벨 lower than himself. The cohort should be equipped with gear\n              appropriate for its 레벨. A character can try to attract a cohort of a particular race, class, and 성향.\n              The cohort’s 성향 may not be opposed to the leader’s 성향 on either the law-vs-chaos or good-vs-evil axis,\n              and the leader takes a 리더십 페널티 if he recruits a cohort of an 성향 different from his own.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>Cohorts earn XP as follows:</p>\n          <p>The cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party’s XP.</p>\n          <p>\n            Divide the cohort’s 레벨 by 레벨 of the PC with whom he or she is associated (the character with the 리더십\n            feat who attracted the cohort).\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to the PC and add that number of experience points to the\n            cohort’s total.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a 레벨 one lower than the associated PC’s character 레벨, the\n            cohort does not gain the new 레벨—its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed attain the next 레벨.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <i>Number of Followers by 레벨: </i><span>The character can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each 레벨. Followers are similar to\n              cohorts, except they’re generally low-레벨 NPCs. Because they’re generally five or more 레벨 behind the\n              character they follow, they’re rarely effective in 전투.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Followers don’t earn experience and thus don’t gain 레벨. However, when a character with 리더십 attains a\n            new 레벨, the player consults the table above to determine if she has acquired more followers, some of which\n            may be higher 레벨 than the existing followers. (You don’t consult the table to see if your cohort gains\n            레벨, however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.)\n          </p>\n        </section>\n        <section id=\"h3-70-lightning-reflexes-general\">\n          <h3>번개 같은 반사신경 [일반]</h3>\n          <div class=\"original-headline\">LIGHTNING REFLEXES [GENERAL]</div>\n          <p>\n            <b>Benefit:</b><span> You get a +2 보너스 on all Reflex 내성 굴림.</span>\n          </p>\n        </section>\n        <section id=\"h3-71-magical-aptitude-general\">\n          <h3>마법 재능 [일반]</h3>\n          <div class=\"original-headline\">MAGICAL APTITUDE [GENERAL]</div>\n          <p>\n            <b>Benefit:</b><span> You get a +2 보너스 on all 주문학 checks and 마법 장치 사용 checks.</span>\n          </p>\n        </section>\n        <section id=\"h3-72-manyshot-general\">\n          <h3>다수 사격 [일반]</h3>\n          <div class=\"original-headline\">MANYSHOT [GENERAL]</div>\n          <p>\n            <b>전제조건:</b><span> Dex 17, 영점 사격, 재빠른 사격, 기본 공격 보너스 +6</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Benefit:</b><span>\n              As a standard action, you may fire two arrows at a single opponent within 30 feet.

In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay\n            the XP when scribing the scroll.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n        <section id=\"h3-92-self-sufficient-general\">\n          <h3>자급자족 [일반]</h3>\n          <div class=\"original-headline\">SELF-SUFFICIENT [GENERAL]</div>\n          <p>\n            <b>Benefit:</b><span> You get a +2 보너스 on all 치료 checks and 생존 checks.</span>\n          </p>\n        </section>\n        <section id=\"h3-93-shield-proficiency-general\">\n          <h3>방패 숙련 [일반]</h3>\n          <div class=\"original-headline\">SHIELD PROFICIENCY [GENERAL]</div>\n          <p>\n            <b>Benefit:</b><span> You can use a 방패 and take only the standard 페널티.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Normal:</b><span>\n              When you are using a 방패 with which you are not proficient, you take 방패’s 갑옷 check 페널티 on 명중\n              굴림 and on all 스킬 판정 that involve moving, including 탑승 checks.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Special:</b><span>\n              바바리안, 음유시인, 사제, 드루이드, 전사, 성기사, and 레인저 automatically have 방패 숙련 as 보너스 feat.\n              They need not select it.</span>\n          </p>\n        </section>\n        <section id=\"h3-94-shot-on-the-run-general\">\n          <h3>기동 사격 [일반]</h3>\n          <div class=\"original-headline\">SHOT ON THE RUN [GENERAL]</div>\n          <p>\n            <b>전제조건:</b><span> Dex 13, 회피, 기동성, 영점 사격, 기본 공격 보너스 +4.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Benefit:</b><span>\n              When using 공격 action with a ranged weapon, you can 이동 both before and after 공격, provided that your\n              total distance moved is not 상급 than your 속도.</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Special:</b><span> A 전사 may select 기동 사격 as one of his 전사 보너스 특기.</span>\n          </p>\n        </section>\n        <section id=\"h3-95-silent-spell-metamagic\">\n          <h3>주문 암송 [메타마법]</h3>\n          <div class=\"original-headline\">SILENT SPELL [METAMAGIC]</div>\n          <p>\n            <b>Benefit:</b><span>\n              A 주문 암송 can be cast with no verbal 구성요소. 주문 without verbal 구성요소 are not affected.
