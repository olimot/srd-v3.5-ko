Regardless, this payment must be made before\n          the creature agrees to 공연 any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the\n          creature begin in the round after it arrives.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A task taking up to 1 minute per 시전자 레벨 requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called.

A long-term task,\n          one requiring up to one day per 시전자 레벨, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require\n          a 상급 gift.

If 내성 굴림 succeeds, the creature resists the spell.

You can\n          attempt to compel the creature to 공연 a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of\n          reward. You make a 매력 check opposed by the creature’s 매력 check. The check is assigned 보너스 of +0 to +6\n          based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service.\n          New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be\n          repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by\n          means of some other spell. Impossible 요구 or unreasonable 명령 are never agreed to.

Once cast, a\n          <i>요술 </i>spell enables you to 공연 simple magical effects for 1 hour. The\n          effects are minor and have severe limitations. A 요술 can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color,\n          clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.\n          It cannot deal 피해 or affect 집중 of spellcasters. <i>요술 </i>can create\n          small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a\n          <i>요술 </i>spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools,\n          무기, or spell 구성요소. Finally, a <i>요술 </i>lacks the power to duplicate\n          any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists\n          only 1 hour.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"h3-27-prismatic-sphere\">\n        <h3>무지갯빛의 구</h3>\n        <div class=\"original-headline\">Prismatic Sphere</div>\n        <p>회피술</p>\n        <p><b>레벨:</b><span> Protection 9, Sor/Wiz 9, Sun 9</span></p>\n        <p><b>구성요소:</b><span> V</span></p>\n        <p><b>거리:</b><span> 10 ft.</span></p>\n        <p><b>효과:</b><span> 10-ft.-radius sphere centered on you</span></p>\n        <p>\n          This spell functions like <i>무지갯빛 벽, </i>except you conjure up an\n          immobile, opaque globe of shimmering, multicolored 빛 that surrounds you and protects you from all forms of\n          공격.

It\n          creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier 이동 with the subject and\n          has three major effects.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          First, the subject gains a +2 deflection 보너스 to AC and a +2 저항 보너스 on 내성 굴림. Both these 보너스\n          apply against 공격 made or effects created by evil creatures.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a\n          <i>마법 단지 </i>공격, for example) or to exercise mental control over the\n          creature (including 부여술(charm) effects and 부여술(충동) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over\n          the subject, such as <i>인간형 지배</i>). The protection does not prevent\n          such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for 지속시간 of the\n          <i>악 방어 마법 </i>effect. If the\n          <i>악 방어 마법 </i>effect ends before the effect granting mental control\n          does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally 명령 the controlled creature. Likewise, the\n          barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.\n          This second effect works regardless of 성향.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon 공격 of such\n          creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such 공격 require touching the warded creature. Good summoned\n          creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded\n          creature makes an 공격 against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. 주문 저항 can allow\n          a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <i>Arcane Material Component: </i><span>A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-foot -diameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the\n            creature to be warded.</span>\n        </p>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"h3-37-protection-from-good\">\n        <h3>선 방어 마법</h3>\n        <div class=\"original-headline\">Protection from Good</div>\n        <p>회피술 [Evil]</p>\n        <p><b>레벨:</b><span> Clr 1, Evil 1, Sor/Wiz 1</span></p>\n        <p>\n          This spell functions like <i>악 방어 마법</i>, except that the deflection and\n          저항 보너스 apply to 공격 from good creatures, and good summoned creatures cannot touch the subject.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"h3-38-protection-from-law\">\n        <h3>질서 방어 마법</h3>\n        <div class=\"original-headline\">Protection from Law</div>\n        <p>회피술 [Chaotic]</p>\n        <p><b>레벨:</b><span> Chaos 1, Clr 1, Sor/Wiz 1</span></p>\n        <p>\n          This spell functions like <i>악 방어 마법</i>, except that the deflection and\n          저항 보너스 apply to 공격 from lawful creatures, and lawful summoned creatures cannot touch the subject.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"h3-39-protection-from-spells\">\n        <h3>주문 방어 마법</h3>\n        <div class=\"original-headline\">Protection from Spells</div>\n        <p>회피술</p>\n        <p><b>레벨: </b><span>Magic 8, Sor/Wiz 8</span></p>\n        <p><b>구성요소:</b><span> V, S, M, F</span></p>\n        <p><b>시전 시간:</b><span> 1 standard action</span></p>\n        <p><b>거리:</b><span> Touch</span></p>\n        <p><b>목표물:</b><span> Up to one creature touched per four 레벨</span></p>\n        <p><b>지속시간:</b><span> 10 min./레벨</span></p>\n        <p><b>내성 굴림: </b><span>Will negates (harmless)</span></p>\n        <p><b>주문 저항:</b><span> Yes (harmless)</span></p>\n        <p>\n          The subject gains a +8 저항 보너스 on 내성 굴림 against 주문 and spell-like 능력(but not against supernatural\n          and extraordinary 능력).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <i>Material Component: </i><span>A diamond of at least 500 gp value, which must be crushed and sprinkled over the targets.</span>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <i>Focus: </i><span>One 1,000 gp diamond per creature to be granted the protection.

Its class, 기본 공격 보너스, base save 보너스, and 히트 포인트 are\n          unchanged. 근력, 민첩, and 건강 scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject’s racial\n          adjustments (since it is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its\n          remaining 능력 점수. The subject’s 레벨(or 히트 다이스) is reduced by 1. If the subject was 1 레벨, its new\n          건강 score is reduced by 2. (If this reduction would put its Con at 0 or lower, it can’t be reincarnated).\n          This 레벨/HD loss or 건강 loss cannot be repaired by any means.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          It’s possible for the change in the subject’s 능력 점수 to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous\n          character class. If this is the case, the subject is well advised to become a multiclass character.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the following table. For nonhumanoid\n          creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can’t be returned to life\n          by this spell.&nbsp; Constructs, 정령, outsiders, and undead creatures can’t be reincarnated.
