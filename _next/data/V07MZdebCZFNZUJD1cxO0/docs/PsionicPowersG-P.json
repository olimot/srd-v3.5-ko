Demiplanes created by this power are very small,\n          very minor 이세계. This power works best when manifested while you are on 영적 세계. Manifestation of this\n          power creates a local density fluctuation that precipitates the creation of a demiplane. At first, the\n          fledgling plane grows in radius at a rate of 1 foot per day to an initial maximum radius of 180 feet as it\n          rapidly draws substance from the surrounding astral ectoplasm. Once the new demiplane reaches its maximum\n          size, it doesn’t really stop growing, but its growth rate decreases to only 1 foot per week (approximately a\n          50-foot increase in radius per year). Once your demiplane is created, you can travel to it using\n          <i>영적 마차</i>, <i>이세계 전이</i>, or\n          some other power or permanent link that you arrange for separately.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          You determine 환경 within the demiplane when you manifest\n          <i>창세, </i>reflecting most any desire you can visualize. You determine\n          factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the general shape of the terrain. This power cannot create\n          life (including vegetation), nor can it create 제작(such as buildings, roads, wells, 던전, and so forth). You\n          must add these details in some other fashion if you desire. You can’t create lingering psionic effects with\n          this power; you have to add those separately, if desired. Similarly, you can’t create a demiplane out of\n          esoteric material, such as silver or uranium; you’re limited to stone and dirt. You can’t manipulate the time\n          trait on your demiplane; its time trait is as 물질 세계. Once your demiplane reaches 180 feet in radius, you\n          can manifest this power again to gradually add another 180 feet of radius to it, and so on.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Antigenesis: If <i>창세 </i>is manifested on 물질 세계, the power takes\n          effect and the demiplane begins to grow at the rate noted above, but it gets no larger than a radius of 1 foot\n          per 레벨. The energies of the new plane are exactly canceled by the energies of the original plane, creating a\n          죽음 감지 like a limited cancer on the original plane. The expanding boundary of 죽음 감지 wipes away all\n          제작, crumbles natural land forms, and evaporates water, leaving behind a uniformly 레벨 범위 of inert dust.\n          Living creatures that pass the boundary of the growing 죽음 감지 are not directly affected, but plants can\n          find no 생활 유지 in the dust of 죽음 감지, water-breathing creatures die quickly when water turns to dust,\n          and mobile animals know enough to leave 범위 alone. Once the wave of change passes, no special essence remains\n          in 죽음 감지, and it may be colonized naturally over the course of several years by bacteria, plants, and\n          animals.\n        </p>\n        <p><i>XP Cost: </i><span>1,000 XP.</span></p>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"h3-2-graft-weapon\">\n        <h3>무기 이식</h3>\n        <div class=\"original-headline\">Graft Weapon</div>\n        <p>정신적대사작용</p>\n        <p><b>레벨:</b><span> 사이킥 군인 3</span></p>\n        <p><b>표시:</b><span> Olfactory</span></p>\n        <p><b>구현 시간:</b><span> 1 standard action</span></p>\n        <p><b>거리:</b><span> Personal</span></p>\n        <p><b>목표물:</b><span> You</span></p>\n        <p><b>지속시간:</b><span> 24 hours (D)</span></p>\n        <p><b>파워 포인트:</b><span> 5</span></p>\n        <p>\n          You attach any melee weapon you can use in one hand—mundane, psionic, or magical—onto the end of one of your\n          arms.

For instance, the grafted weapon is treated as a natural weapon for\n          목적 of delivering a touch 공격 with a power in conjunction with the weapon 공격. As with any power (or spell)\n          melee touch 공격 made in conjunction with a natural weapon 공격, the touch 공격 effect is not delivered unless\n          the natural weapon strikes normally; on a failed 공격, the touch power (or spell) is wasted.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          For a 사이킥 군인 under the effect of the <i>야수의 발톱 </i>power, grafting\n          a weapon means that 공격 with this hand deal the base 피해 of the weapon, instead of the claw upon which a\n          사이킥 군인 normally relies.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          While your hand is grafted to a weapon, you lose the use of that hand and take a –2 페널티 on all 스킬 판정\n          requiring the use of hands.

If you are healed, so\n          is your grafted weapon. If your weapon is destroyed, you permanently lose 2 points of 건강; the ability drain\n          persists until you can restore your natural anatomy (by means of\n          <i>재생 </i>or a similar effect).\n        </p>\n        <p>When this power’s 지속시간 expires, the grafted weapon falls to the ground and your hand returns.</p>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"h3-3-grease-psionic\">\n        <h3>기름칠, 사이오닉</h3>\n        <div class=\"original-headline\">Grease, Psionic</div>\n        <p>재귀창조(Creation)</p>\n        <p><b>레벨:</b><span> 사이언/와일더 1</span></p>\n        <p><b>표시:</b><span> Visual and olfactory</span></p>\n        <p><b>구현 시간:</b><span> 1 standard action</span></p>\n        <p><b>거리:</b><span> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 레벨) </span></p>\n        <p><b>Target or 범위:</b><span> One object or a 10-ft. square</span></p>\n        <p><b>지속시간:</b><span> 1 round/레벨(D)</span></p>\n        <p><b>내성 굴림:</b><span> See spell text</span></p>\n        <p><b>파워 저항:</b><span> No</span></p>\n        <p><b>파워 포인트:</b><span> 1</span></p>\n        <p>As the <i>기름칠 </i>spell, except as noted here.</p>\n        <p>Sometimes this power is referred to as <i>ectoplasmic sheen.</i></p>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"h3-4-grip-of-iron\">\n        <h3>강철 손아귀</h3>\n        <div class=\"original-headline\">Grip of Iron</div>\n        <p>정신적대사작용</p>\n        <p><b>레벨:</b><span> 사이킥 군인 1</span></p>\n        <p><b>표시:</b><span> Visual</span></p>\n        <p><b>구현 시간:</b><span> 1 immediate action</span></p>\n        <p><b>거리:</b><span> Personal</span></p>\n        <p><b>목표물:</b><span> You</span></p>\n        <p><b>지속시간:</b><span> 1 round/레벨</span></p>\n        <p><b>파워 포인트:</b><span> 1</span></p>\n        <p>\n          You can improve your chances in a 드잡이 as an immediate action, gaining a +4 enhancement 보너스 on your\n          드잡이 checks.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain the benefit of the power in the\n          current round.

The space within this barrier is impervious to most\n          psionic effects, including powers, 유사사이오닉 능력, and supernatural 능력. Likewise, it prevents the\n          functioning of any 사이오닉 아이템 or powers within its confines. A\n          <i>무의 사이오닉 장 </i>suppresses any power or psionic effect used within,\n          brought into, or manifested into its 범위, but does not negate it. Time spent within a\n          <i>무의 사이오닉 장 </i>counts against a suppressed effect’s 지속시간.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          영적 구조물 and summoned creatures wink out if they enter a\n          <i>무의 사이오닉 장</i>.

Time spent winked out counts normally against 지속시간 of the power that is maintaining the construct or\n          summoned creature.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Creation powers with instantaneous 지속시간 and calling powers are not affected by a\n          <i>무의 사이오닉 장 </i>because the power itself is no longer in effect, only\n          its result.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A normal creature (a normally encountered construct rather than a created one, for instance) can enter the\n          범위, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a psionic sword does not function psionically within the\n          범위, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The power has no effect on 골렘 and other\n          constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless\n          they have been summoned or have a limited 지속시간, in which case they are treated like any other summoned\n          creatures). 정령, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned.
