You can’t create a sensation where none\n          exists, nor make the subject completely oblivious to a sensation, but you can replace the specifics of one\n          sensation with different specifics. For instance, you could make a human look like 드워프(or one human look\n          like another specific human), a closed door look like it is open, a vat of acid smell like rose water, a\n          parrot look like a bookend, stale rations taste like fresh fruit, a 빛 pat feel like a dagger thrust, a scream\n          sound like the howling wind, and so on.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          You can switch between senses you falsify round by round.

You do\n          not leave the <i>융합 </i>with more 히트 포인트 than you entered it with,\n          unless you were damaged prior to the <i>융합 </i>and the fused being was\n          subsequently healed. In a like manner, the fused being’s remaining 파워 포인트 are split between you and the\n          other creature (you can leave with more points than you entered with, as long as you don’t exceed the maximum\n          파워 포인트 for your 레벨 and ability score). Ability 피해 and negative 레벨 are also split between you and\n          the other creature. (If an odd number of negative 레벨 or ability score reductions must be split, you decide\n          whether you or the other creature receives the additional loss.)\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If a fused being is killed, it separates into its constituent creatures, both ofwhich are also 죽음. You\n          cannot use <i>분열 </i>on a fused being.\n        </p>\n        <p><i>XP Cost: </i><span>50 XP.</span></p>\n      </section>\n    </section>\n  \n\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
