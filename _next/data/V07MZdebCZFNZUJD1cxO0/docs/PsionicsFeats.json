Doing so, however, is draining. A\n          manifester must put a little of himself or herself into every psionic item he or she creates.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A psionic item creation feat lets a manifester create a psionic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type\n          of items they involve, the various 아이템 제작 특기 all have certain features in common.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <b>XP Cost:</b><span>\n            Power and energy that the manifester would normally keep is expended when making a psionic item. 경험치 비용\n            of using a psionic item creation feat equals 1/25 the cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot\n            spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a 레벨. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new\n            레벨, he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance a\n            레벨.</span>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <b>Raw Materials Cost:</b><span>\n            Creating a psionic item requires costly 구성요소, most of which are consumed in the process. The cost of\n            these materials equals 1/2 the cost of the item.</span>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Using a psionic item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or psionic workshop, special tools,\n          and other 장비. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply\n          (such as if he’s traveling far from home).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <b>Time:</b><span>\n            The time to create a psionic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one\n            day.</span>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <b>Item Cost:</b><span>\n            도르제 제작, 파워스톤 새기기, and 문신 새기기 create items that directly reproduce the effects of powers,\n            and 근력 of these items depends on their 구현자 레벨—that is, a power from such an item has 근력 it would\n            have if manifested by a manifester of that 레벨. Often, that is the minimum 구현자 레벨 necessary to\n            manifest the power. (Randomly discovered items usually follow this rule.) However, when making such an item,\n            the item’s 근력 can be set higher than the minimum. Any time a character creates an item using a power\n            augmented by spending additional 파워 포인트, the character’s effective 구현자 레벨 for 목적 of calculating\n            the item’s cost increases by 1 for each 1 additional power point spent. (Augmentation is a feature of many\n            powers that allows the power to be amplified in various ways if additional 파워 포인트 are spent.) All other\n            레벨-dependent parameters of the power forged into the item are set according to the effective 구현자\n            레벨.</span>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The price of 사이오닉 아이템(and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) depends on 레벨 of the\n          power and a character’s 구현자 레벨. The character’s 구현자 레벨 must be high enough that the item creator can\n          manifest the power at the chosen 레벨. To find the final price in each case, multiply the character’s 구현자\n          레벨 by the power 레벨, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <i>파워스톤: </i><span>Base price = power 레벨 x 구현자 레벨 x 25 gp</span>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <i>사이오닉 문신: </i><span>Base price = power 레벨 x 구현자 레벨 x 50 gp</span>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <i>도르제: </i><span>Base price = power 레벨 x 구현자 레벨 x 750 gp</span>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <b>Extra Costs:</b><span>\n            Any dorje, power stone, or psionic tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate\n            cost.\n          </span>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          For 사이오닉 문신 and 파워스톤, the creator must pay the XP cost when creating the item.
