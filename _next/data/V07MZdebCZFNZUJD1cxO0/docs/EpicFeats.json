A character can gain an 에픽 feat at the same 레벨 at\n          which he or she gains the prerequisite, just as with regular 특기.

Others may be 아이템 제작\n          특기 or 메타마법 특기, which follow all the normal rules for such 특기, except as specified in the feat’s\n          묘사. In addition, some 특기 are defined as 신성 특기 or as 야생 특기. Such 특기 are described below.\n        </p>\n        <section id=\"h3-4-divine-feats\">\n          <h3>신성 특기</h3>\n          <div class=\"original-headline\">DIVINE FEATS</div>\n          <p>\n            특기 in this category share a few characteristics. First, they all have as a prerequisite the ability to\n            turn (or, in most cases, rebuke) undead. Thus, they are open to 사제, 성기사 of 4 레벨 이상, and any\n            prestige class that has that ability. (An ability to turn other creatures does not qualify a character to\n            select one of these 특기.) Second, the force that powers a 신성 feat is the ability to channel positive or\n            negative energy to 언데드 퇴치. Each use of a 신성 feat costs the character one turn/rebuke attempt from his\n            or her number of attempts each day. If a character doesn’t have any turn/rebuke attempts left, he or she\n            can’t use the feat. Since turning or rebuking is a standard action, activating any of these 특기 is also a\n            standard action.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n        <section id=\"h3-5-wild-feats\">\n          <h3>야생 특기</h3>\n          <div class=\"original-headline\">WILD FEATS</div>\n          <p>\n            특기 in this category share the characteristic of relating to the ability to use\n            <i>wild shape </i>as a 드루이드. These 특기 require the character to have\n            the ability to use <i>wild shape </i>before acquiring the feat.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n        <section id=\"h3-6-epic-psionic-feats\">\n          <h3>에픽 사이오닉 특기</h3>\n          <div class=\"original-headline\">EPIC PSIONIC FEATS</div>\n          <p>\n            Psionic characters can acquire 에픽 “psionically flavored” 특기.&nbsp; Some 특기 require so much translation\n            that converted 특기 are provided. Whenever a feat concerns conferring or altering a spell in some fashion,\n            some translation must be done to use it with 사이오닉. Sometimes this translation is as straightforward as\n            changing a few 이름. Translating 에픽 메타마법 특기 to 에픽 메타사이오닉 특기 requires that 주문학 전제조건\n            be replaced with 사이크래프트. It also requires a little math—instead of casting a spell at a higher 레벨, a\n            psionic character pays more 파워 포인트. For every spell slot one 레벨 higher than the spell’s actual 레벨\n            메타마법 feat requires, the metapsionic feat requires a character to pay a power point cost equal to its\n            standard cost +2. Likewise, when a feat allows a spellcaster to “pay” one less 레벨 to use a 메타마법 feat,\n            the psionic version allows a character to pay 2 파워 포인트 less for a given metapsionic feat.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"h2-7-feats\">\n        <h2>특기</h2>\n        <div class=\"original-headline\">FEATS</div>\n        <section id=\"h3-8-additional-magic-item-space-epic\">\n          <h3>추가 마법 아이템 공간 [에픽]</h3>\n          <div class=\"original-headline\">ADDITIONAL MAGIC ITEM SPACE [EPIC]</div>\n          <p>\n            <b>Benefit:</b><span>\n              Choose one type of magic item that has a limit on the number a character can simultaneously wear and gain\n              its benefit.
