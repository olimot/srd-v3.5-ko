With the exception of 회피 보너스, most circumstance 보너스, and\n            racial 보너스, only the better 보너스 works (see 사이오닉과 마법 효과 조합하기, below).

If your power is being resisted by a creature with 파워 저항, you\n            must make a 구현자 레벨 check (d20 + 구현자 레벨) at least equal to the creature’s 파워 저항 for the power\n            to affect that creature. The defender’s 파워 저항 functions like an 방어도 against psionic 공격. 주문 저항\n            is equivalent to 파워 저항 unless 사이오닉 Is Different option is in use. Include any adjustments to\n            your 구현자 레벨 on this 구현자 레벨 check.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            파워 저항 line and 설명 문구 of a power 묘사 tell you whether 파워 저항 protects creatures from the\n            power. In many cases, 파워 저항 applies only when a resistant creature is targeted by the power, not when a\n            resistant creature encounters a power that is already in place.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The terms “object” and “harmless” mean the same thing for 파워 저항 as they do for 내성 굴림. A creature\n            with 파워 저항 must voluntarily lower 저항(a standard action) to be affected by a power noted as 해악\n            less. In such a case, you do not need to make 구현자 레벨 check described above.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n        <section id=\"h3-34-power-points\">\n          <h3>파워 포인트</h3>\n          <div class=\"original-headline\">POWER POINTS</div>\n          <p>All powers have a 파워 포인트 line, indicating the power’s cost.</p>\n          <p>\n            The psionic character class tables show how many 파워 포인트 a character has access to each day, depending\n            on 레벨.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A power’s cost is determined by its 레벨, as shown below.
