It can look like a stalactite, by holding its tentacles stiffly under itself, or like a lump of rock, spreading its tentacles so the membrane between them covers its body. Its shell and skin usually resemble limestone, but a darkmantle can change its color to match almost any type of stony background.</p><p>A darkmantle is about 4 feet long from the tips of its tentacles to the top of its head.

It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p><p>If it wins the grapple check, it attaches to the opponent’s head and can constrict.</p><p><strong>수축 (범):</strong> A darkmantle deals 1d4+4 points of damage with a successful grapple check.</p><p><strong>비시각적시야 (범):</strong> A darkmantle can “see” by emitting high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allows it to ascertain objects and creatures within 90 feet. A <i>silence</i> spell negates this ability and effectively blinds the darkmantle.</p><p><strong>스킬:</strong> A darkmantle has a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.</p><p>These bonuses are lost if its blindsight is negated.

The slime is particularly effective against stone. A delver’s mere touch deals 2d6 points of acid damage to organic creatures or objects. Against metallic creatures or objects, a delver’s slime deals 4d8 points of damage, and against stony creatures (including earth elementals) or objects it deals 8d10 points of damage. A slam attack by a delver leaves a patch of slime that deals 2d6 points of damage on contact and another 2d6 points of damage in each of the next 2 rounds. A large quantity (at least a quart) of water or weak acid, such as vinegar, washes off the slime. An opponent’s armor and clothing dissolve and become useless immediately unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. Weapons that strike a delver also dissolve immediately unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. A creature attacking a delver with natural weapons takes damage from its slime each time an attack hits unless the creature succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. These save DCs are Constitution-based.</p><p><strong>암석 조형 (범):</strong> A delver can alter its slime to temporarily soften stone instead of dissolving it. Once every 10 minutes, a delver can soften and shape up to 25 cubic feet of stone, as a <i>stone shape</i> spell (caster level 15th).</p></section></section><section id=\"h1-5-demon\"><h1>데몬</h1><p>Demons are a race of creatures native to chaotic evil-aligned planes.

The DC is 19 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><strong>함정의 정수 (초):</strong> The devourer is named for its ability to consume an enemy’s life essence. To do so, it must forgo its normal melee attacks and make a trap essence attack. This requires a normal attack roll but deals no damage. The he save DC is Charisma-based. A slain creature’s essence is trapped within the devourer’s ribs, and the tiny figure takes on that victim’s features. The trapped essence cannot be raised or resurrected, but a <i>limited wish, miracle,</i> or <i>wish</i> spell frees it, as does destroying the devourer. A devourer can hold only one essence at a time.</p><p>The trapped essence provides a devourer with enough power to use five spell-like abilities for each Hit Die or level of the trapped creature. As this energy is expended, the twisted soul fades away until it evaporates completely. The trapped essence gains one negative level for every five times the devourer uses one of its spell-like abilities. When the essence’s number of negative levels equals the creature’s total Hit Dice or level, the essence is destroyed. If an essence is freed, the restored creature must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save for each negative level or lose that level permanently.</p><p><strong>유사주문 능력:</strong> At the start of any encounter, the trapped essence within a devourer is assumed to have 3d4+3 levels (enough fuel for thirty to seventy-five uses). Once per round, a devourer can use one of the following abilities: <i>confusion</i> (DC 17), <i>control undead</i> (DC 20), <i>ghoul touch</i> (DC 15), <i>lesser planar ally, ray of enfeeblement</i> (DC 14), <i>spectral hand, suggestion</i> (DC 16), <i>true seeing</i>. Caster level 18th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p><strong>주문 굴절 (초):</strong> The trapped essence provides a measure of magical protection. If any of the following spells are cast at the devourer and overcome its spell resistance, they affect the imprisoned essence instead: <i>banishment, chaos hammer, confusion, crushing despair, detect thoughts, dispel evil, dominate person, fear, geas/quest, holy word, hypnosis, imprisonment, magic jar, maze, suggestion, trap the soul,</i> or any form of charm or compulsion. In many cases, this deflection effectively neutralizes the spell. Some of these effects might eliminate the trapped essence, depriving the devourer of its spell-like abilities until it can consume another victim.</p></section></section>"},"__N_SSG":true}
