An adult male sahuagin stands roughly 6 feet tall and weighs\n        about 200 pounds.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Sahuagin are the natural enemy of aquatic elves. The two cannot coexist peacefully: Wars between them are\n        prolonged, bloody affairs that sometimes interfere with shipping and maritime trade. Sahuagin have an only\n        slightly less vehement hatred for tritons.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Sahuagin speak their own language, Sahuagin. Thanks to their high Intelligence scores, most sahuagin also speak\n        two bonus languages, usually Common and Aquan.\n      </p>\n      <section id=\"h2-2-combat\">\n        <h2 title=\"COMBAT\">전투</h2>\n        <p>\n          Sahuagin are savage fighters, asking for and giving no quarter. When swimming, a sahuagin tears with its feet\n          as it strikes with its talons or a weapon. About half of any group of sahuagin are also armed with nets.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong title=\"Blindsense (Ex):\">비감각적감각 (범):</strong> A sahuagin can locate creatures underwater within\n          a 30-foot radius.

It\n          gains +2 Constitution and +2 Strength, and takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class.

The communication is limited to fairly simple concepts such as “food,”\n          “danger,” and “enemy.” Sahuagin can use the Handle Animal skill to befriend and train sharks.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong title=\"Water Dependent (Ex):\">물 종속성 (범):</strong> Sahuagin can survive out of the water for 1\n          hour per 2 points of Constitution (after that, refer to the drowning rules on page 304 of the\n          <i>Dungeon Master ’s Guide</i>).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong title=\"Skills:\">스킬:</strong> A sahuagin has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some\n          special action or avoid a hazard.

For game purposes a swarm is defined as a\n        single creature with a space of 10 feet—gigantic hordes are actually composed of dozens of swarms in close\n        proximity. A swarm has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier, a single speed,\n        and a single Armor Class. It makes saving throws as a single creature.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Many different creatures can mass as swarms; bat swarms, centipede swarms, hellwasp swarms, locust swarms, rat\n        swarms, and spider swarms are described here. The swarm’s type varies with the nature of the component creature\n        (most are animals or vermin), but all swarms have the swarm subtype.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures or 1,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive\n        creatures consists of 1,500 nonflying creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Fine creatures consists of\n        10,000 creatures, whether they are flying or not. Swarms of nonflying creatures include many more creatures than\n        could normally fit in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because creatures in a swarm are packed\n        tightly together and generally crawl over each other and their prey when moving or attacking. Larger swarms are\n        represented by multiples of single swarms. A large swarm is completely shapeable, though it usually remains\n        contiguous.\n      </p>\n      <section id=\"h2-55-combat\">\n        <h2 title=\"COMBAT\">전투</h2>\n        <p>\n          In order to attack, a single swarm moves into opponents’ spaces, which provokes an attack of opportunity. It\n          can occupy the same space as a creature of any size, since it crawls all over its prey, but remains a creature\n          with a 10-foot space. Swarms never make attacks of opportunity, but they can provoke attacks of opportunity.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Unlike other creatures with a 10-foot space, a swarm is shapeable. It can occupy any four contiguous squares,\n          and it can squeeze through any space large enough to contain one of its component creatures.\n        </p>\n        <section id=\"h4-56-vulnerabilities-of-swarms\">\n          <h4 title=\"Vulnerabilities of Swarms\">무리의 취약성</h4>\n          <p>\n            Swarms are extremely difficult to fight with physical attacks.

A swarm deals\n            3d6 points of damage to any creature whose space it occupies at the end of its move. The swarm can take over\n            the bodies of its prey and infest both the living and the dead, using them as horrible living (or unliving)\n            puppets to accomplish acts of wickedness that a swarm of insects could never attempt.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A hellwasp swarm’s attack is treated as an evil-aligned weapon and a magic weapon for the purpose of\n            overcoming damage reduction.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <strong title=\"Distraction (Ex):\">집중방해 (범):</strong> Any living creature that begins its turn with a\n            hellwasp swarm in its space must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round.

Inhabiting requires 1 minute, and the victim must be\n            Small, Medium, or Large (although four swarms working together can inhabit a Huge creature). The swarm can\n            abandon the body at any time, although doing this takes 1 full round. Any attack against the host deals half\n            damage to the hellwasp swarm as well, although the swarm’s resistances and immunities may negate some or all\n            of this damage.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a dead body, it can restore animation to the creature and control its\n            movements, effectively transforming it into a zombie of the appropriate size for as long as the swarm\n            remains inside. If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a living victim, it can neutralize the effects of its own\n            poison and control the victim’s movement and actions as if using <i>dominate monster</i> on the victim. The\n            hellwasps quickly consume a living victim, dealing 2d4 points of Constitution damage per hour they inhabit a\n            body.

The swarm can attempt a Disguise check to conceal its inhabitation of a\n            host, with a –4 penalty if currently inhabiting a Small host.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A <i>remove disease</i> or <i>heal</i> spell cast on an inhabited victim forces the hellwasp swarm to\n            abandon its host.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <strong title=\"Poison (Ex):\">독 (범):</strong> Injury, Fortitude DC 18, initial and secondary damage 1d6\n            Dex.
