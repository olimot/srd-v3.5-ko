      shields).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong title=\"Aura of Good (Ex):\">선의 오라 (범):</strong> The power of a paladin’s aura of good (see the\n          <i>detect good</i> spell) is equal to her paladin level.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong title=\"Detect Evil (Sp):\"><i>악 감지</i> (주):</strong> At will, a paladin can use <i>detect evil</i>,\n          as the spell.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong title=\"Smite Evil (Su):\">악의 처벌 (초):</strong> Once per day, a paladin may attempt to smite evil\n          with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point\n          of damage per paladin level. If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no\n          effect, but the ability is still used up for that day.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          At 5th level, and at every five levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, as\n          indicated on Table: The Paladin, to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong title=\"Divine Grace (Su):\">신성한 우아함 (초):</strong> At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to\n          her Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong title=\"Lay on Hands (Su):\">치유의 손길 (초):</strong> Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin with a\n          Charisma score of 12 or higher can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can heal a\n          total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level x her Charisma bonus. A paladin may choose to\n          divide her healing among multiple recipients, and she doesn’t have to use it all at once. Using lay on hands\n          is a standard action.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Alternatively, a paladin can use any or all of this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures. Using\n          lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn’t provoke an attack of\n          opportunity. The paladin decides how many of her daily allotment of points to use as damage after successfully\n          touching an undead creature.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong title=\"Aura of Courage (Su):\">용기의 오라 (초):</strong> Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune\n          to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws\n          against fear effects.\n        </p>\n        <p>This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead.</p>\n        <p>\n          <strong title=\"Divine Health (Ex):\">신성 건강 (범):</strong> At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all\n          diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong title=\"Turn Undead (Su):\">언데드 구마 (초):</strong>When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the\n          supernatural ability to turn undead.

      <strong title=\"Favored Enemy (Ex):\">호적 (범):</strong> At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature\n          from among those given on Table: Ranger Favored Enemies. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense\n          Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, he gets a\n          +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an\n          additional favored enemy from those given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against\n          any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as\n          indicated on the table.

The ranger rolls 1d20\n          and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical\n          domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be\n          within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way\n          takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he\n          takes a –4 penalty on the check.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong title=\"Combat Style (Ex):\">전투 방식 (범):</strong> At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two\n          combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. This choice affects the character’s class features but\n          does not restrict his selection of feats or special abilities in any way.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not have the\n          normal prerequisites for that feat.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does\n          not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The benefits of the ranger’s chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of\n          his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.\n        </p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Endurance:\">지구력:</strong> A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>\n        <p>\n          <strong title=\"Animal Companion (Ex):\">동물 동료 (범):</strong> At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal\n          companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse\n          (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or\n          partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures may be added to the ranger’s list of options:\n          crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on\n          his adventures as appropriate for its kind.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          This ability functions like the druid ability of the same name, except that the ranger’s effective druid level\n          is one-half his ranger level. A ranger may select from the alternative lists of animal companions just as a\n          druid can, though again his effective druid level is half his ranger level. Like a druid, a ranger cannot\n          select an alternative animal if the choice would reduce his effective druid level below 1st.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong title=\"Spells:\">주문:</strong> Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small\n          number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list. A ranger must choose and prepare his\n          spells in advance (see below).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The\n          Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger’s Wisdom\n          modifier.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His\n          base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he\n          has a high Wisdom score. When Table: The Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given\n          spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell\n          level. The ranger does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A ranger prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though he cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a\n          <i>cure</i> spell in its place. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided\n          that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is one-half his\n          ranger level.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong title=\"Improved Combat Style (Ex):\">향상된 전투 방식 (범):</strong> At 6th level, a ranger’s aptitude\n          in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves.

Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit\n          points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can\n          attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC =\n          damage dealt). If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full\n          damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll—if she\n          is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can’t use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a\n          character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue’s evasion ability does not apply to the defensive\n          roll.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <em title=\"Improved Evasion (Ex):\">향상된 회피 (범):</em> This ability works like evasion, except that while\n          the rogue still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks henceforth she henceforth\n          takes only half damage on a failed save.

id=\"h5-14-class-features\">\n        <h5 title=\"Class Features\">직업 특성</h5>\n        <p>All of the following are class features of the sorcerer.</p>\n        <p>\n          <strong title=\"Weapon and Armor Proficiency:\">무기와 갑옷 숙련:</strong> Sorcerers are proficient with all\n          simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a\n          sorcerer’s gestures, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong title=\"Spells:\">주문:</strong> A sorcerer casts arcane spells which are drawn primarily from the\n          sorcerer/wizard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, the way a\n          wizard or a cleric must (see below).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The\n          Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a sorcerer’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer’s\n          Charisma modifier.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His\n          base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Sorcerer. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if\n          he has a high Charisma score.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A sorcerer’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer begins play knowing four 0-level spells and\n          two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new sorcerer level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated\n          on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not affected\n          by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known are fixed.) These new spells can be common\n          spells chosen from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the sorcerer has gained\n          some understanding of by study. The sorcerer can’t use this method of spell acquisition to learn spells at a\n          faster rate, however.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a\n          sorcerer can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the sorcerer “loses” the\n          old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being\n          exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level sorcerer spell the sorcerer can\n          cast. A sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the\n          spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows\n          at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level. He does not have to\n          decide ahead of time which spells he’ll cast.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong title=\"Familiar:\">패밀리어:</strong> A sorcerer can obtain a familiar (see below). Doing so takes 24\n          hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small\n          animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The sorcerer chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the sorcerer advances in level, his familiar also\n          increases in power.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the sorcerer, the sorcerer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving\n          throw. Failure means he loses 200 experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the loss to one-half\n          that amount. However, a sorcerer’s experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar’s\n          demise or dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can\n          be raised from the dead just as a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point when\n          this happy event occurs.\n        </p>\n        <p>A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.</p>\n      </section>\n    </section>\n    <section id=\"h1-15-wizard\">\n      <h1 title=\"WIZARD\">마법사</h1>\n      <p><strong title=\"Alignment:\">성향:</strong> Any.</p>\n      <p><strong title=\"Hit Die:\">히트 다이스:</strong> d4.</p>\n      <section id=\"h5-16-class-skills\">\n        <h5 title=\"Class Skills\">직업 스킬</h5>\n        <p>\n          The wizard’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher\n          Script (Int), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).
