If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75% chance that the spell\n          simply fails.

Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same\n          materials and perfect in every detail), so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The\n          replica costs 50 gp.) You can have but one pair of these chests at any given time—even a <i>wish</i> spell\n          does not allow more.

After sixty days, there is a cumulative chance\n          of 5% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there\n          is no way, not even with a <i>wish</i> spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an\n          extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Living things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally, and they die if they run out of food, air, water, or\n          whatever they need to survive.\n        </p>\n        <p><em title=\"Focus:\">집중:</em> The chest and its replica.</p>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"h3-11-secret-page\">\n        <h3 title=\"Secret Page\">비밀 페이지</h3>\n        <p>Transmutation</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Level:\">레벨:</strong> Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 3</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Components:\">구성요소:</strong> V, S, M</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Casting Time:\">시전 시간:</strong> 10 minutes</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Range:\">거리:</strong> Touch</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Target:\">목표물:</strong> Page touched, up to 3 sq. ft. in size</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Duration:\">지속시간:</strong> Permanent</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Saving Throw:\">내성 굴림:</strong> None</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Spell Resistance:\">주문 저항:</strong> No</p>\n        <p>\n          <i>Secret page</i> alters the contents of a page so that they appear to be something entirely different.

Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10x100 feet in a random horizontal\n          direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted\n          1d10x1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any\n          creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders\n          each creature fatigued (no save).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <i>Shadow walk</i> can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this\n          usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The\n          transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Any creatures touched by you when <i>shadow walk</i> is cast also make the transition to the borders of the\n          Plane of Shadow.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance\n          for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you\n          into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"h3-24-shambler\">\n        <h3 title=\"Shambler\">휘청거리는 자</h3>\n        <p>Conjuration (Creation)</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Level:\">레벨:</strong> Drd 9, Plant 9</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Components:\">구성요소:</strong> V, S</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Casting Time:\">시전 시간:</strong> 1 standard action</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Range:\">거리:</strong> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>\n        <p>\n          <strong title=\"Effect:\">효과:</strong> Three or more shambling mounds, no two of which can be more than 30 ft.\n          apart; see text\n        </p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Duration:\">지속시간:</strong> Seven days or seven months (D); see text</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Saving Throw:\">내성 굴림:</strong> None</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Spell Resistance:\">주문 저항:</strong> No</p>\n        <p>\n          The <i>shambler</i> spell creates 1d4+2 shambling mounds with 11 HD each.

You can’t create a simulacrum of a creature whose Hit Dice or levels exceed\n          twice your caster level. You must make a Disguise check when you cast the spell to determine how good the\n          likeness is.

No special telepathic link exists, so command\n          must be exercised in some other manner. A simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful. It cannot\n          increase its level or abilities. If reduced to 0 hit points or otherwise destroyed, it reverts to snow and\n          melts instantly into nothingness.

The snare can be made from any supple\n          vine, a thong, or a rope. When you cast <i>snare</i> upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings\n          (Search DC 23 for a character with the trapfinding ability to locate). One end of the snare is tied in a loop\n          that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend and\n          then straighten when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting\n          it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens\n          around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The snare is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength\n          check that is a full-round action. The snare has AC 7 and 5 hit points. A successful escape from the snare\n          breaks the loop and ends the spell.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"h3-44-soften-earth-and-stone\">\n        <h3 title=\"Soften Earth and Stone\">물렁한 대지와 암석</h3>\n        <p>Transmutation [Earth]</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Level:\">레벨:</strong> Drd 2, Earth 2</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Components:\">구성요소:</strong> V, S, DF</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Casting Time:\">시전 시간:</strong> 1 standard action</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Range:\">거리:</strong> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Area:\">범위:</strong> 10-ft. square/level; see text</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Duration:\">지속시간:</strong> Instantaneous</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Saving Throw:\">내성 굴림:</strong> None</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Spell Resistance:\">주문 저항:</strong> No</p>\n        <p>\n          When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in the spell’s area is softened. Wet earth\n          becomes thick mud, dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay that is easily molded or\n          chopped. You affect a 10-footsquare area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience\n          of the ground at that spot. Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected. Earth or stone\n          creatures are not affected.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A creature in mud must succeed on a Reflex save or be caught for 1d2 rounds and unable to move, attack, or\n          cast spells. A creature that succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and it can’t run or\n          charge.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area can move at only half their normal\n          speed and can’t run or charge over the surface.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate\n          areas they may not have been able to affect before.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          While <i>soften earth and stone</i> does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings or vertical\n          surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the\n          loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a manufactured structure by softening the ground\n          beneath it, causing it to settle.

The vapors prevent\n          effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like).

The weapon\n          takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to\n          you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It\n          strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing\n          each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per\n          round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a\n          weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike\n          incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes\n          from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat\n          actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or\n          if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not,\n          the weapon continues to attack the previous round’s target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it\n          gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your\n          base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the <i>spiritual weapon</i> is a ranged weapon, use the spell’s\n          range, not the weapon’s normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A <i>spiritual weapon</i> cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>,\n          <i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. A\n          <i>spiritual weapon</i>’s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that\n          spell resistance the first time the <i>spiritual weapon</i> strikes it. If the weapon is successfully\n          resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the\n          duration of the spell.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity’s own personal weapon. A cleric without a deity\n          gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a <i>spiritual weapon</i> of\n          any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapons\n          associated with each alignment are as follows.\n        </p>\n        <p><em title=\"Chaos:\">혼돈:</em> Battleaxe</p>\n        <p><em title=\"Evil:\">악:</em> Light flail</p>\n        <p><em title=\"Good:\">선:</em> Warhammer</p>\n        <p><em title=\"Law:\">질서:</em> Longsword,</p>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"h3-62-statue\">\n        <h3 title=\"Statue\">석상</h3>\n        <p>Transmutation</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Level:\">레벨:</strong> Sor/Wiz 7</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Components:\">구성요소:</strong> V, S, M</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Casting Time:\">시전 시간:</strong> 1 round</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Range:\">거리:</strong> Touch</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Target:\">목표물:</strong> Creature touched</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Duration:\">지속시간:</strong> 1 hour/level (D)</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Saving Throw:\">내성 굴림:</strong> Will negates (harmless)</p>\n        <p><strong title=\"Spell Resistance:\">주문 저항:</strong> Yes (harmless)</p>\n        <p>\n          A <i>statue</i> spell turns the subject to solid stone, along with any garments and equipment worn or carried.\n          In statue form, the subject gains hardness 8.

When triggered, a\n          <i>symbol of death</i> slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose\n          combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The <i>symbol of death</i> affects the closest creatures\n          first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the <i>symbol</i> becomes active\n          and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points’ worth of\n          creatures, whichever comes first. Any creature that enters the area while the <i>symbol of death</i> is active\n          is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need\n          save against the <i>symbol</i> only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area\n          and returns while the <i>symbol</i> is still active, it must save again.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Until it is triggered, the <i>symbol of death</i> is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60\n          feet). To be effective, a <i>symbol of death</i> must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent\n          location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the <i>symbol of death</i> ineffective, unless a creature\n          removes the covering, in which case the <i>symbol of death</i> works normally.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          As a default, a <i>symbol of death</i> is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as\n          you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a\n          portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from\n          a symbol of death can’t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading\n          the rune). Once the spell is cast, a <i>symbol of death</i>’s triggering conditions cannot be changed.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In this case, “reading” the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a\n          cover over a <i>symbol of death</i> to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You\n          can’t use a <i>symbol of death</i> offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains\n          untriggered if an item bearing the <i>symbol of death</i> is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a\n          <i>symbol of death</i> cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you\n          desire. Special conditions for triggering a <i>symbol of death</i> can be based on a creature’s name,\n          identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as\n          level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don’t qualify.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          When scribing a <i>symbol of death</i>, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it\n          from triggering the effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune’s effects so long\n          as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it\n          must use the password again.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          You also can attune any number of creatures to the <i>symbol of death,</i> but doing this can extend the\n          casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten\n          creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes\n          24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer. Any creature attuned to a\n          <i>symbol of death</i> cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when\n          triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own <i>symbols of death</i>, and thus always\n          ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <i>Read magic</i> allows you to identify a <i>symbol of death</i> with a DC 19 Spellcraft check. Of course, if\n          the <i>symbol of death</i> is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A <i>symbol of death</i> can be removed by a successful <i>dispel magic</i> targeted solely on the rune. An\n          <i>erase</i> spell has no effect on a <i>symbol of death.</i> Destruction of the surface where a\n          <i>symbol of death</i> is inscribed destroys the <i>symbol</i> but also triggers it.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <i>Symbol of death</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent\n          <i>symbol of death</i> that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive\n          for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <em title=\"Note:\">비고:</em> Magic traps such as <i>symbol of death</i> are hard to detect and disable.
