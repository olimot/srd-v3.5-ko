Spells come in two types: arcane (cast by\nbards, sorcerers, and wizards) and divine (cast by clerics, druids, and\nexperienced paladins and rangers). Some spellcasters select their spells from a\nlimited list of spells known, while others have access to a wide variety of\noptions.</p><p>Most\nspellcasters prepare their spells in advance—whether from a spellbook or\nthrough devout prayers and meditation— while some cast spells spontaneously\nwithout preparation.</p><p>Despite\nthese different ways that characters use to learn or prepare their spells, when\nit comes to casting them, the spells are very much alike.</p><p>Cutting across\nthe categories of arcane and divine spells are the eight schools of magic.\nThese schools represent the different ways that spells take effect.</p><section id=\"h2-1-casting-spells\"><h2>주문 시전하기</h2><p>Whether\na spell is arcane or divine, and whether a character prepares spells in advance\nor chooses them on the spot, casting a spell works the same way.</p><section id=\"h3-2-choosing-a-spell\"><h3>주문 선택하기</h3><p>First\nyou must choose which spell to cast. If you’re a cleric, druid, experienced\npaladin, experienced ranger, or wizard, you select from among spells prepared\nearlier in the day and not yet cast (see Preparing Wizard Spells and Preparing\nDivine Spells).</p><p>If\nyou’re a bard or sorcerer, you can select any spell you know, provided you are\ncapable of casting spells of that level or higher.</p><p>To\ncast a spell, you must be able to speak (if the spell has a verbal component),\ngesture (if it has a somatic component), and manipulate the material components\nor focus (if any). Additionally, you must concentrate to cast a spell.</p><p>If\na spell has multiple versions, you choose which version to use when you cast\nit. You don’t have to prepare (or learn, in the case of a bard or sorcerer) a\nspecific version of the spell.</p><p>Once\nyou’ve cast a prepared spell, you can’t cast it again until you prepare it\nagain. (If you’ve prepared multiple copies of a single spell, you can cast each\ncopy once.) If you’re a bard or sorcerer, casting a spell counts against your\ndaily limit for spells of that spell level, but you can cast the same spell\nagain if you haven’t reached your limit.</p></section><section id=\"h3-3-concentration\"><h3>집중</h3><p>To\ncast a spell, you must concentrate. If something interrupts your concentration\nwhile you’re casting, you must make a Concentration check or lose the spell.\nThe more distracting the interruption and the higher the level of the spell you\nare trying to cast, the higher the DC is. If you fail the check, you lose the\nspell just as if you had cast it to no effect.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Injury:</span><span> If while trying to cast a\nspell you take damage, you must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + points of\ndamage taken + the level of the spell you’re casting). If you fail the check,\nyou lose the spell without effect. The interrupting event strikes during\nspellcasting if it comes between when you start and when you complete a spell\n(for a spell with a casting time of 1 full round or more) or if it comes in\nresponse to your casting the spell (such as an attack of opportunity provoked\nby the spell or a contingent attack, such as a readied action).</span></p><p>If\nyou are taking continuous damage half the damage is considered to take place\nwhile you are casting a spell. You must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2\nthe damage that the continuous source last dealt + the level of the spell\nyou’re casting). If the last damage dealt was the last damage that the effect\ncould deal then the damage is over, and it does not distract you.</p><p>Repeated\ndamage does not count as continuous damage.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Spell:\n</span><span>If you\nare affected by a spell while attempting to cast a spell of your own, you must\nmake a Concentration check or lose the spell you are casting. If the spell\naffecting you deals damage, the DC is 10 + points of damage + the level of the\nspell you’re casting.</span></p><p>If\nthe spell interferes with you or distracts you in some other way, the DC is the\nspell’s saving throw DC + the level of the spell you’re casting. For a spell\nwith no saving throw, it’s the DC that the spell’s saving throw would have if a\nsave were allowed.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Grappling\nor Pinned:</span><span>\nThe only spells you can cast while grappling or pinned are those without\nsomatic components and whose material components (if any) you have in hand.\nEven so, you must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + the level of the spell\nyou’re casting) or lose the spell.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Vigorous\nMotion:</span><span>\nIf you are riding on a moving mount, taking a bouncy ride in a wagon, on a\nsmall boat in rough water, below-decks in a storm-tossed ship, or simply being\njostled in a similar fashion, you must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + the\nlevel of the spell you’re casting) or lose the spell. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Violent\nMotion: </span><span>If\nyou are on a galloping horse, taking a very rough ride in a wagon, on a small\nboat in rapids or in a storm, on deck in a storm-tossed ship, or being tossed\nroughly about in a similar fashion, you must make a Concentration check (DC 15\n+ the level of the spell you’re casting) or lose the spell.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Violent\nWeather: </span><span>You\nmust make a Concentration check if you try to cast a spell in violent weather.\nIf you are in a high wind carrying blinding rain or sleet, the DC is 5 + the\nlevel of the spell you’re casting. If you are in wind-driven hail, dust, or\ndebris, the DC is 10 + the level of the spell you’re casting. In either case,\nyou lose the spell if you fail the Concentration check. If the weather is\ncaused by a spell, use the rules in the Spell subsection above.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Casting\nDefensively:</span><span>\nIf you want to cast a spell without provoking any attacks of opportunity, you\nmust make a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell you’re casting)\nto succeed. You lose the spell if you fail.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Entangled:</span><span> If you want to cast a spell\nwhile entangled in a net or by a tanglefoot bag or while you’re affected by a\nspell with similar effects, you must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast\nthe spell. You lose the spell if you fail.</span></p></section><section id=\"h3-4-counterspells\"><h3>주문 무효화</h3><p>It\nis possible to cast any spell as a counterspell. By doing so, you are using the\nspell’s energy to disrupt the casting of the same spell by another character.\nCounterspelling works even if one spell is divine and the other arcane.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">How\nCounterspells Work: </span><span>To use a counterspell, you must select an opponent as the\ntarget of the counterspell. You do this by choosing the ready action. In doing\nso, you elect to wait to complete your action until your opponent tries to cast\na spell. (You may still move your speed, since ready is a standard action.)</span></p><p>If\nthe target of your counterspell tries to cast a spell, make a Spellcraft check\n(DC 15 + the spell’s level). This check is a free action. If the check\nsucceeds, you correctly identify the opponent’s spell and can attempt to\ncounter it. If the check fails, you can’t do either of these things.</p><p>To\ncomplete the action, you must then cast the correct spell. As a general rule, a\nspell can only counter itself. If you are able to cast the same spell and you\nhave it prepared (if you prepare spells), you cast it, altering it slightly to\ncreate a counterspell effect. If the target is within range, both spells\nautomatically negate each other with no other results.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Counterspelling\nMetamagic Spells:</span><span> Metamagic feats are not taken into account when determining\nwhether a spell can be countered</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Specific\nExceptions:</span><span>\nSome spells specifically counter each other, especially when they have\ndiametrically opposed effects.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: 700;\">Dispel\nMagic </span><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">as\na Counterspell:</span><span>\nYou can use <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">dispel magic </span>to counterspell another spellcaster, and you\ndon’t need to identify the spell he or she is casting. However, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">dispel magic\n</span>doesn’t always work as a counterspell (see the spell description).</span></p></section><section id=\"h3-5-caster-level\"><h3>시전자 레벨</h3><p>A\nspell’s power often depends on its caster level, which for most spellcasting\ncharacters is equal to your class level in the class you’re using to cast the\nspell. </p><p>You\ncan cast a spell at a lower caster level than normal, but the caster level you\nchoose must be high enough for you to cast the spell in question, and all\nlevel-dependent features must be based on the same caster level. </p><p>In\nthe event that a class feature, domain granted power, or other special ability\nprovides an adjustment to your caster level, that adjustment applies not only\nto effects based on caster level (such as range, duration, and damage dealt)\nbut also to your caster level check to overcome your target’s spell resistance\nand to the caster level used in dispel checks (both the dispel check and the DC\nof the check). </p></section><section id=\"h3-6-spell-failure\"><h3>주문 실패</h3><p>If\nyou ever try to cast a spell in conditions where the characteristics of the\nspell cannot be made to conform, the casting fails and the spell is wasted.</p><p>Spells\nalso fail if your concentration is broken and might fail if you’re wearing\narmor while casting a spell with somatic components.</p></section><section id=\"h3-7-the-spell-s-result\"><h3>주문의 결과</h3><p>Once\nyou know which creatures (or objects or areas) are affected, and whether those\ncreatures have made successful saving throws (if any were allowed), you can\napply whatever results a spell entails.</p></section><section id=\"h3-8-special-spell-effects\"><h3>특수 주문 효과</h3><p>Many\nspecial spell effects are handled according to the school of the spells in\nquestion Certain other special spell features are found across spell schools.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Attacks:</span><span> Some spell descriptions\nrefer to attacking. All offensive combat actions, even those that don’t damage\nopponents are considered attacks. Attempts to turn or rebuke undead count as\nattacks. All spells that opponents resist with saving throws, that deal damage,\nor that otherwise harm or hamper subjects are attacks. Spells that summon\nmonsters or other allies are not attacks because the spells themselves don’t\nharm anyone.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Bonus\nTypes:</span><span>\nUsually, a bonus has a type that indicates how the spell grants the bonus. The\nimportant aspect of bonus types is that two bonuses of the same type don’t\ngenerally stack. With the exception of dodge bonuses, most circumstance\nbonuses, and racial bonuses, only the better bonus works (see Combining Magical\nEffects, below). The same principle applies to penalties—a character taking two\nor more penalties of the same type applies only the worst one.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Bringing\nBack the Dead:</span><span>\nSeveral spells have the power to restore slain characters to life.</span></p><p>When\na living creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves the Material Plane,\ntravels through the Astral Plane, and goes to abide on the plane where the\ncreature’s deity resides. If the creature did not worship a deity, its soul\ndeparts to the plane corresponding to its alignment. Bringing someone back from\nthe dead means retrieving his or her soul and returning it to his or her body.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Level\nLoss: </span><span>Any\ncreature brought back to life usually loses one level of experience. The character’s\nnew XP total is midway between the minimum needed for his or her new (reduced)\nlevel and the minimum needed for the next one. If the character was 1st level\nat the time of death, he or she loses 2 points of Constitution instead of\nlosing a level.</span></p><p>This\nlevel loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any mortal means, even <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">wish\n</span>or <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">miracle. </span>A revived character can regain a lost level by earning\nXP through further adventuring. A revived character who was 1st level at the\ntime of death can regain lost points of Constitution by improving his or her\nConstitution score when he or she attains a level that allows an ability score\nincrease.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Preventing\nRevivification: </span><span>Enemies\ncan take steps to make it more difficult for a character to be returned from\nthe dead. Keeping the body prevents others from using <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">raise dead </span>or <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">resurrection\n</span>to restore the slain character to life. Casting <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">trap the soul </span>prevents\nany sort of revivification unless the soul is first released.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Revivification\nagainst One’s Will: </span><span>A soul cannot be returned to life if it does not wish to be.\nA soul knows the name, alignment, and patron deity (if any) of the character\nattempting to revive it and may refuse to return on that basis.</span></p></section><section id=\"h3-9-combining-magical-effects\"><h3>주문 효과 조합하기</h3><p>Spells\nor magical effects usually work as described, no matter how many other spells\nor magical effects happen to be operating in the same area or on the same\nrecipient. Except in special cases, a spell does not affect the way another\nspell operates. Whenever a spell has a specific effect on other spells, the\nspell description explains that effect. Several other general rules apply when\nspells or magical effects operate in the same place:</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Stacking\nEffects:</span><span> Spells\nthat provide bonuses or penalties on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws,\nand other attributes usually do not stack with themselves. More generally, two\nbonuses of the same type don’t stack even if they come from different spells\n(or from effects other than spells; see Bonus Types, above). </span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Different\nBonus Names: </span><span>The\nbonuses or penalties from two different spells stack if the modifiers are of\ndifferent types. A bonus that isn’t named stacks with any bonus.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Same\nEffect More than Once in Different Strengths: </span><span>In cases when two or more identical\nspells are operating in the same area or on the same target, but at different\nstrengths, only the best one applies.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Same\nEffect with Differing Results: </span><span>The same spell can sometimes produce varying effects\nif applied to the same recipient more than once. Usually the last spell in the\nseries trumps the others. None of the previous spells are actually removed or\ndispelled, but their effects become irrelevant while the final spell in the\nseries lasts.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">One\nEffect Makes Another Irrelevant: </span><span>Sometimes, one spell can render a later spell\nirrelevant. Both spells are still active, but one has rendered the other\nuseless in some fashion.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Multiple\nMental Control Effects: </span><span>Sometimes magical effects that establish mental control\nrender each other irrelevant, such as a spell that removes the subjects ability\nto act. Mental controls that don’t remove the recipient’s ability to act\nusually do not interfere with each other. If a creature is under the mental\ncontrol of two or more creatures, it tends to obey each to the best of its\nability, and to the extent of the control each effect allows. If the controlled\ncreature receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the competing controllers\nmust make opposed Charisma checks to determine which one the creature obeys.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Spells\nwith Opposite Effects:</span><span> Spells with opposite effects apply normally, with all\nbonuses, penalties, or changes accruing in the order that they apply. Some\nspells negate or counter each other. This is a special effect that is noted in\na spell’s description. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Instantaneous\nEffects:</span><span>\nTwo or more spells with instantaneous durations work cumulatively when they\naffect the same target.</span></p></section></section><section id=\"h2-10-spell-descriptions\"><h2>주문 설명</h2><p>The\ndescription of each spell is presented in a standard format. Each category of\ninformation is explained and defined below.</p><section id=\"h3-11-name\"><h3>이름</h3><p>The\nfirst line of every spell description gives the name by which the spell is\ngenerally known.</p></section><section id=\"h3-12-school-subschool\"><h3>학파 (하위학파)</h3><p>Beneath\nthe spell name is a line giving the school of magic (and the subschool, if appropriate)\nthat the spell belongs to.</p><p>Almost\nevery spell belongs to one of eight schools of magic. A school of magic is a\ngroup of related spells that work in similar ways. A small number of spells (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">arcane\nmark, limited wish, permanency, prestidigitation, </span>and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">wish</span>) are\nuniversal, belonging to no school.</p><section id=\"h5-13-abjuration\"><h5>회피술</h5><p>Abjurations\nare protective spells. They create physical or magical barriers, negate magical\nor physical abilities, harm trespassers, or even banish the subject of the\nspell to another plane of existence. </p><p>If\none abjuration spell is active within 10 feet of another for 24 hours or more,\nthe magical fields interfere with each other and create barely visible energy\nfluctuations. The DC to find such spells with the Search skill drops by 4.</p><p>If\nan abjuration creates a barrier that keeps certain types of creatures at bay,\nthat barrier cannot be used to push away those creatures. If you force the\nbarrier against such a creature, you feel a discernible pressure against the\nbarrier. If you continue to apply pressure, you end the spell.</p></section><section id=\"h5-14-conjuration\"><h5>창조술</h5><p>Each\nconjuration spell belongs to one of five subschools. Conjurations bring\nmanifestations of objects, creatures, or some form of energy to you (the\nsummoning subschool), actually transport creatures from another plane of\nexistence to your plane (calling), heal (healing), transport creatures or\nobjects over great distances (teleportation), or create objects or effects on\nthe spot (creation). Creatures you conjure usually, but not always, obey your\ncommands.</p><p>A\ncreature or object brought into being or transported to your location by a\nconjuration spell cannot appear inside another creature or object, nor can it\nappear floating in an empty space. It must arrive in an open location on a\nsurface capable of supporting it.</p><p>The\ncreature or object must appear within the spell’s range, but it does not have\nto remain within the range.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Calling:</span><span> A calling spell\ntransports a creature from another plane to the plane you are on. The spell\ngrants the creature the one-time ability to return to its plane of origin,\nalthough the spell may limit the circumstances under which this is possible.\nCreatures who are called actually die when they are killed; they do not\ndisappear and reform, as do those brought by a summoning spell (see below). The\nduration of a calling spell is instantaneous, which means that the called\ncreature can’t be dispelled.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Creation:\n</span><span>A\ncreation spell manipulates matter to create an object or creature in the place\nthe spellcaster designates (subject to the limits noted above). If the spell\nhas a duration other than instantaneous, magic holds the creation together, and\nwhen the spell ends, the conjured creature or object vanishes without a trace.\nIf the spell has an instantaneous duration, the created object or creature is\nmerely assembled through magic. It lasts indefinitely and does not depend on\nmagic for its existence.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Healing:\n</span><span>Certain\ndivine conjurations heal creatures or even bring them back to life.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Summoning:</span><span> A summoning spell\ninstantly brings a creature or object to a place you designate. When the spell\nends or is dispelled, a summoned creature is instantly sent back to where it\ncame from, but a summoned object is not sent back unless the spell description\nspecifically indicates this. A summoned creature also goes away if it is killed\nor if its hit points drop to 0 or lower. It is not really dead. It takes 24\nhours for the creature to reform, during which time it can’t be summoned again.</span></p><p>When\nthe spell that summoned a creature ends and the creature disappears, all the\nspells it has cast expire. A summoned creature cannot use any innate summoning\nabilities it may have, and it refuses to cast any spells that would cost it XP,\nor to use any spell-like abilities that would cost XP if they were spells.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Teleportation:</span><span> A teleportation spell\ntransports one or more creatures or objects a great distance. The most powerful\nof these spells can cross planar boundaries. Unlike summoning spells, the\ntransportation is (unless otherwise noted) one-way and not dispellable.</span></p><p>Teleportation\nis instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane. Anything that blocks astral\ntravel also blocks teleportation.</p></section><section id=\"h5-15-divination\"><h5>점술</h5><p>Divination\nspells enable you to learn secrets long forgotten, to predict the future, to\nfind hidden things, and to foil deceptive spells.</p><p>Many\ndivination spells have cone-shaped areas. These move with you and extend in the\ndirection you look. The cone defines the area that you can sweep each round. If\nyou study the same area for multiple rounds, you can often gain additional\ninformation, as noted in the descriptive text for the spell.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Scrying:</span><span> A scrying spell creates\nan invisible magical sensor that sends you information. Unless noted otherwise,\nthe sensor has the same powers of sensory acuity that you possess. This level\nof acuity includes any spells or effects that target you, but not spells or\neffects that emanate from you. However, the sensor is treated as a separate,\nindependent sensory organ of yours, and thus it functions normally even if you\nhave been blinded, deafened, or otherwise suffered sensory impairment.</span></p><p>Any\ncreature with an Intelligence score of 12 or higher can notice the sensor by\nmaking a DC 20 Intelligence check. The sensor can be dispelled as if it were an\nactive spell.</p><p>Lead\nsheeting or magical protection blocks a scrying spell, and you sense that the\nspell is so blocked.</p></section><section id=\"h5-16-enchantment\"><h5>마력부여술</h5><p>Enchantment\nspells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior.</p><p>All\nenchantments are mind-affecting spells. Two types of enchantment spells grant\nyou influence over a subject creature.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Charm:</span><span> A charm spell changes how\nthe subject views you, typically making it see you as a good friend.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Compulsion:</span><span> A compulsion spell forces\nthe subject to act in some manner or changes the way her mind works. Some\ncompulsion spells determine the subject’s actions or the effects on the\nsubject, some compulsion spells allow you to determine the subject’s actions when\nyou cast the spell, and others give you ongoing control over the subject.</span></p></section><section id=\"h5-17-evocation\"><h5>환기</h5><p>Evocation\nspells manipulate energy or tap an unseen source of power to produce a desired\nend. In effect, they create something out of nothing. Many of these spells\nproduce spectacular effects, and evocation spells can deal large amounts of\ndamage.</p></section><section id=\"h5-18-illusion\"><h5>환상</h5><p>Illusion\nspells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things\nthat are not there, not see things that are there, hear phantom noises, or\nremember things that never happened.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Figment:</span><span> A figment spell creates a\nfalse sensation. Those who perceive the figment perceive the same thing, not\ntheir own slightly different versions of the figment. (It is not a personalized\nmental impression.) Figments cannot make something seem to be something else. A\nfigment that includes audible effects cannot duplicate intelligible speech\nunless the spell description specifically says it can. If intelligible speech\nis possible, it must be in a language you can speak. If you try to duplicate a\nlanguage you cannot speak, the image produces gibberish. Likewise, you cannot\nmake a visual copy of something unless you know what it looks like.</span></p><p>Because\nfigments and glamers (see below) are unreal, they cannot produce real effects\nthe way that other types of illusions can. They cannot cause damage to objects\nor creatures, support weight, provide nutrition, or provide protection from the\nelements. Consequently, these spells are useful for confounding or delaying\nfoes, but useless for attacking them directly. </p><p>A\nfigment’s AC is equal to 10 + its size modifier.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Glamer:</span><span> A glamer spell changes a\nsubject’s sensory qualities, making it look, feel, taste, smell, or sound like\nsomething else, or even seem to disappear.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Pattern:</span><span> Like a figment, a pattern\nspell creates an image that others can see, but a pattern also affects the\nminds of those who see it or are caught in it. All patterns are mind-affecting\nspells.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Phantasm:\n</span><span>A\nphantasm spell creates a mental image that usually only the caster and the\nsubject (or subjects) of the spell can perceive. This impression is totally in\nthe minds of the subjects. It is a personalized mental impression. (It’s all in\ntheir heads and not a fake picture or something that they actually see.) Third\nparties viewing or studying the scene don’t notice the phantasm. All phantasms\nare mind-affecting spells.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Shadow:</span><span> A shadow spell creates\nsomething that is partially real from extradimensional energy. Such illusions\ncan have real effects. Damage dealt by a shadow illusion is real.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Saving\nThrows and Illusions (Disbelief ): </span><span>Creatures encountering an illusion\nusually do not receive saving throws to recognize it as illusory until they\nstudy it carefully or interact with it in some fashion.</span></p><p>A\nsuccessful saving throw against an illusion reveals it to be false, but a\nfigment or phantasm remains as a translucent outline.</p><p>A\nfailed saving throw indicates that a character fails to notice something is\namiss. A character faced with proof that an illusion isn’t real needs no saving\nthrow. If any viewer successfully disbelieves an illusion and communicates this\nfact to others, each such viewer gains a saving throw with a +4 bonus.</p></section><section id=\"h5-19-necromancy\"><h5>강령술</h5><p>Necromancy\nspells manipulate the power of death, unlife, and the life force. Spells\ninvolving undead creatures make up a large part of this school. </p></section><section id=\"h5-20-transmutation\"><h5>변환</h5><p>Transmutation\nspells change the properties of some creature, thing, or condition. </p></section></section><section id=\"h3-21-descriptor\"><h3>[표지]</h3><p>Appearing\non the same line as the school and subschool, when applicable, is a descriptor\nthat further categorizes the spell in some way. Some spells have more than one\ndescriptor.</p><p>The\ndescriptors are acid, air, chaotic, cold, darkness, death, earth, electricity,\nevil, fear, fire, force, good, language-dependent, lawful, light,\nmind-affecting, sonic, and water.</p><p>Most\nof these descriptors have no game effect by themselves, but they govern how the\nspell interacts with other spells, with special abilities, with unusual\ncreatures, with alignment, and so on.</p><p>A\nlanguage-dependent spell uses intelligible language as a medium for\ncommunication. If the target cannot understand or cannot hear what the caster\nof a language-dependant spell says the spell fails.</p><p>A\nmind-affecting spell works only against creatures with an Intelligence score of\n1 or higher.</p></section><section id=\"h3-22-level\"><h3>레벨</h3><p>The\nnext line of a spell description gives the spell’s level, a number between 0\nand 9 that defines the spell’s relative power. This number is preceded by an\nabbreviation for the class whose members can cast the spell. The Level entry\nalso indicates whether a spell is a domain spell and, if so, what its domain\nand its level as a domain spell are. A spell’s level affects the DC for any\nsave allowed against the effect.</p><p>Names\nof spellcasting classes are abbreviated as follows: bard Brd; cleric Clr; druid\nDrd; paladin Pal; ranger Rgr; sorcerer Sor; wizard Wiz.</p><p>The\ndomains a spell can be associated with include Air, Animal, Chaos, Death,\nDestruction, Earth, Evil, Fire, Good, Healing, Knowledge, Law, Luck, Magic,\nPlant, Protection, Strength, Sun, Travel, Trickery, War, and Water.</p></section><section id=\"h3-23-components\"><h3>구성요소</h3><p>A\nspell’s components are what you must do or possess to cast it. The Components\nentry in a spell description includes abbreviations that tell you what type of\ncomponents it has. Specifics for material, focus, and XP components are given\nat the end of the descriptive text. Usually you don’t worry about components,\nbut when you can’t use a component for some reason or when a material or focus\ncomponent is expensive, then the components are important.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Verbal\n(V):</span><span> A\nverbal component is a spoken incantation. To provide a verbal component, you\nmust be able to speak in a strong voice. A <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">silence </span>spell or a gag spoils\nthe incantation (and thus the spell). A spellcaster who has been deafened has a\n20% chance to spoil any spell with a verbal component that he or she tries to\ncast.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Somatic\n(S):</span><span> A\nsomatic component is a measured and precise movement of the hand. You must have\nat least one hand free to provide a somatic component.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Material\n(M):</span><span> A\nmaterial component is one or more physical substances or objects that are\nannihilated by the spell energies in the casting process. Unless a cost is\ngiven for a material component, the cost is negligible. Don’t bother to keep\ntrack of material components with negligible cost. Assume you have all you need\nas long as you have your spell component pouch.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Focus\n(F): </span><span>A\nfocus component is a prop of some sort. Unlike a material component, a focus is\nnot consumed when the spell is cast and can be reused. As with material\ncomponents, the cost for a focus is negligible unless a price is given. Assume\nthat focus components of negligible cost are in your spell component pouch.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Divine\nFocus (DF):</span><span>\nA divine focus component is an item of spiritual significance. The divine focus\nfor a cleric or a paladin is a holy symbol appropriate to the character’s\nfaith. </span></p><p>If\nthe Components line includes F/DF or M/DF, the arcane version of the spell has\na focus component or a material component (the abbreviation before the slash)\nand the divine version has a divine focus component (the abbreviation after the\nslash).</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">XP\nCost (XP):</span><span>\nSome powerful spells entail an experience point cost to you. No spell can\nrestore the XP lost in this manner. You cannot spend so much XP that you lose a\nlevel, so you cannot cast the spell unless you have enough XP to spare.\nHowever, you may, on gaining enough XP to attain a new level, use those XP for\ncasting a spell rather than keeping them and advancing a level. The XP are\ntreated just like a material component—expended when you cast the spell,\nwhether or not the casting succeeds.</span></p></section><section id=\"h3-24-casting-time\"><h3>시전 시간</h3><p>Most\nspells have a casting time of 1 standard action. Others take 1 round or more,\nwhile a few require only a free action.</p><p>A\nspell that takes 1 round to cast is a full-round action. It comes into effect\njust before the beginning of your turn in the round after you began casting the\nspell. You then act normally after the spell is completed.</p><p>A\nspell that takes 1 minute to cast comes into effect just before your turn 1\nminute later (and for each of those 10 rounds, you are casting a spell as a\nfull-round action, just as noted above for 1- round casting times). These\nactions must be consecutive and uninterrupted, or the spell automatically\nfails.</p><p>When\nyou begin a spell that takes 1 round or longer to cast, you must continue the\nconcentration from the current round to just before your turn in the next round\n(at least). If you lose concentration before the casting is complete, you lose\nthe spell.</p><p>A\nspell with a casting time of 1 free action doesn’t count against your normal\nlimit of one spell per round. However, you may cast such a spell only once per\nround. Casting a spell with a casting time of 1 free action doesn’t provoke\nattacks of opportunity.</p><p>You\nmake all pertinent decisions about a spell (range, target, area, effect, version,\nand so forth) when the spell comes into effect.</p></section><section id=\"h3-25-range\"><h3>범위</h3><p>A\nspell’s range indicates how far from you it can reach, as defined in the Range\nentry of the spell description. A spell’s range is the maximum distance from\nyou that the spell’s effect can occur, as well as the maximum distance at which\nyou can designate the spell’s point of origin. If any portion of the spell’s\narea would extend beyond this range, that area is wasted. Standard ranges\ninclude the following.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Personal:</span><span> The spell affects only\nyou.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Touch:</span><span> You must touch a creature\nor object to affect it. A touch spell that deals damage can score a critical\nhit just as a weapon can. A touch spell threatens a critical hit on a natural\nroll of 20 and deals double damage on a successful critical hit. Some touch\nspells allow you to touch multiple targets. You can touch as many willing\ntargets as you can reach as part of the casting, but all targets of the spell\nmust be touched in the same round that you finish casting the spell.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Close:</span><span> The spell reaches as far\nas 25 feet away from you. The maximum range increases by 5 feet for every two\nfull caster levels.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Medium:</span><span> The spell reaches as far\nas 100 feet + 10 feet per caster level.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Long:</span><span> The spell reaches as far\nas 400 feet + 40 feet per caster level.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Unlimited:</span><span> The spell reaches\nanywhere on the same plane of existence.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Range\nExpressed in Feet:</span><span> Some spells have no standard range category, just a range\nexpressed in feet.</span></p></section><section id=\"h3-26-aiming-a-spell\"><h3>주문 조준하기</h3><p>You must make\nsome choice about whom the spell is to affect or where the effect is to\noriginate, depending on the type of spell. The next entry in a spell\ndescription defines the spell’s target (or targets), its effect, or its area,\nas appropriate.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Target\nor Targets:</span><span>\nSome spellshave a target or targets. You cast these spells on creatures\nor objects, as defined by the spell itself. You must be able to see or touch\nthe target, and you must specifically choose that target. You do not have to\nselect your target until you finish casting the spell.</span></p><p>If\nthe target of a spell is yourself (the spell description has a line that reads\nTarget: You), you do not receive a saving throw, and spell resistance does not\napply. The Saving Throw and Spell Resistance lines are omitted from such\nspells.</p><p>Some\nspells restrict you to willing targets only. Declaring yourself as a willing\ntarget is something that can be done at any time (even if you’re flat-footed or\nit isn’t your turn). Unconscious creatures are automatically considered\nwilling, but a character who is conscious but immobile or helpless (such as one\nwho is bound, cowering, grappling, paralyzed, pinned, or stunned) is not\nautomatically willing.</p><p>Some\nspells allow you to redirect the effect to new targets or areas after you cast\nthe spell. Redirecting a spell is a move action that does not provoke attacks\nof opportunity.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Effect:</span><span> Some spells create or\nsummon things rather than affecting things that are already present.</span></p><p>You\nmust designate the location where these things are to appear, either by seeing\nit or defining it. Range determines how far away an effect can appear, but if\nthe effect is mobile it can move regardless of the spell’s range.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ray:\n</span><span>Some\neffects are rays. You aim a ray as if using a ranged weapon, though typically\nyou make a ranged touch attack rather than a normal ranged attack. As with a\nranged weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an invisible creature and hope\nyou hit something. You don’t have to see the creature you’re trying to hit, as\nyou do with a targeted spell. Intervening creatures and obstacles, however, can\nblock your line of sight or provide cover for the creature you’re aiming at.</span></p><p>If\na ray spell has a duration, it’s the duration of the effect that the ray\ncauses, not the length of time the ray itself persists.</p><p>If\na ray spell deals damage, you can score a critical hit just as if it were a\nweapon. A ray spell threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals\ndouble damage on a successful critical hit.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Spread:\n</span><span>Some\neffects, notably clouds and fogs, spread out from a point of origin, which must\nbe a grid intersection. The effect can extend around corners and into areas\nthat you can’t see. Figure distance by actual distance traveled, taking into\naccount turns the spell effect takes. When determining distance for spread\neffects, count around walls, not through them. As with movement, do not trace\ndiagonals across corners. You must designate the point of origin for such an\neffect, but you need not have line of effect (see below) to all portions of the\neffect.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Area:</span><span> Some spells affect an\narea. Sometimes a spell description specifies a specially defined area, but\nusually an area falls into one of the categories defined below.</span></p><p>Regardless\nof the shape of the area, you select the point where the spell originates, but\notherwise you don’t control which creatures or objects the spell affects. The\npoint of origin of a spell is always a grid intersection. When determining\nwhether a given creature is within the area of a spell, count out the distance\nfrom the point of origin in squares just as you do when moving a character or when\ndetermining the range for a ranged attack. The only difference is that instead\nof counting from the center of one square to the center of the next, you count\nfrom intersection to intersection.</p><p>You\ncan count diagonally across a square, but remember that every second diagonal\ncounts as 2 squares of distance. If the far edge of a square is within the\nspell’s area, anything within that square is within the spell’s area. If the\nspell’s area only touches the near edge of a square, however, anything within that\nsquare is unaffected by the spell.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Burst,\nEmanation, or Spread: </span><span>Most spells that affect an area function as a burst, an\nemanation, or a spread. In each case, you select the spell’s point of origin\nand measure its effect from that point.</span></p><p>A\nburst spell affects whatever it catches in its area, even including creatures\nthat you can’t see. It can’t affect creatures with total cover from its point\nof origin (in other words, its effects don’t extend around corners). The\ndefault shape for a burst effect is a sphere, but some burst spells are\nspecifically described as cone-shaped. A burst’s area defines how far from the\npoint of origin the spell’s effect extends.</p><p>An\nemanation spell functions like a burst spell, except that the effect continues\nto radiate from the point of origin for the duration of the spell. Most\nemanations are cones or spheres.</p><p>A\nspread spell spreads out like a burst but can turn corners. You select the\npoint of origin, and the spell spreads out a given distance in all directions.\nFigure the area the spell effect fills by taking into account any turns the\nspell effect takes.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Cone,\nCylinder, Line, or Sphere: </span><span>Most spells that affect an area have a particular shape, such\nas a cone, cylinder, line, or sphere.</span></p><p>A\ncone-shaped spell shoots away from you in a quarter-circle in the direction you\ndesignate. It starts from any corner of your square and widens out as it goes.\nMost cones are either bursts or emanations (see above), and thus won’t go\naround corners.</p><p>When\ncasting a cylinder-shaped spell, you select the spell’s point of origin. This\npoint is the center of a horizontal circle, and the spell shoots down from the\ncircle, filling a cylinder. A cylinder-shaped spell ignores any obstructions\nwithin its area.</p><p>A\nline-shaped spell shoots away from you in a line in the direction you\ndesignate. It starts from any corner of your square and extends to the limit of\nits range or until it strikes a barrier that blocks line of effect. A\nline-shaped spell affects all creatures in squares that the line passes through.</p><p>A\nsphere-shaped spell expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical area.\nSpheres may be bursts, emanations, or spreads.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Creatures:\n</span><span>A spell\nwith this kind of area affects creatures directly (like a targeted spell), but\nit affects all creatures in an area of some kind rather than individual\ncreatures you select. The area might be a spherical burst , a cone-shaped\nburst, or some other shape.</span></p><p>Many\nspells affect “living creatures,” which means all creatures other than\nconstructs and undead. Creatures in the spell’s area that are not of the\nappropriate type do not count against the creatures affected.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Objects:\n</span><span>A spell\nwith this kind of area affects objects within an area you select (as Creatures,\nbut affecting objects instead).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Other:\n</span><span>A spell\ncan have a unique area, as defined in its description.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">(S)\nShapeable: </span><span>If\nan Area or Effect entry ends with “(S),” you can shape the spell. A shaped\neffect or area can have no dimension smaller than 10 feet. Many effects or\nareas are given as cubes to make it easy to model irregular shapes.\nThree-dimensional volumes are most often needed to define aerial or underwater\neffects and areas.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Line\nof Effect:</span><span>\nA line of effect is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what a spell can\naffect. A line of effect is canceled by a solid barrier. It’s like line of\nsight for ranged weapons, except that it’s not blocked by fog, darkness, and\nother factors that limit normal sight.</span></p><p>You\nmust have a clear line of effect to any target that you cast a spell on or to\nany space in which you wish to create an effect. You must have a clear line of\neffect to the point of origin of any spell you cast<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span></p><p>A\nburst, cone, cylinder, or emanation spell affects only an area, creatures, or\nobjects to which it has line of effect from its origin (a spherical burst’s\ncenter point, a cone-shaped burst’s starting point, a cylinder’s circle, or an\nemanation’s point of origin).</p><p>An\notherwise solid barrier with a hole of at least 1 square foot through it does\nnot block a spell’s line of effect. Such an opening means that the 5-foot length\nof wall containing the hole is no longer considered a barrier for purposes of a\nspell’s line of effect.</p></section><section id=\"h3-27-duration\"><h3>지속시간</h3><p>A\nspell’s Duration entry tells you how long the magical energy of the spell\nlasts.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Timed\nDurations: </span><span>Many\ndurations are measured in rounds, minutes, hours, or some other increment. When\nthe time is up, the magic goes away and the spell ends. If a spell’s duration\nis variable the duration is rolled secretly (the caster doesn’t know how long\nthe spell will last). </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Instantaneous:</span><span> The spell energy comes\nand goes the instant the spell is cast, though the consequences might be\nlong-lasting.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Permanent:\n</span><span>The\nenergy remains as long as the effect does. This means the spell is vulnerable\nto <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">dispel magic</span>. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Concentration:</span><span> The spell lasts as long\nas you concentrate on it. Concentrating to maintain a spell is a standard\naction that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Anything that could break\nyour concentration when casting a spell can also break your concentration while\nyou’re maintaining one, causing the spell to end.</span></p><p>You\ncan’t cast a spell while concentrating on another one. Sometimes a spell lasts\nfor a short time after you cease concentrating.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Subjects,\nEffects, and Areas:</span><span> If the spell affects creatures directly the result travels\nwith the subjects for the spell’s duration. If the spell creates an effect, the\neffect lasts for the duration. The effect might move or remain still. Such an\neffect can be destroyed prior to when its duration ends. If the spell affects\nan area then the spell stays with that area for its duration. </span></p><p>Creatures\nbecome subject to the spell when they enter the area and are no longer subject\nto it when they leave.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Touch\nSpells and Holding the Charge:</span><span> In most cases, if you don’t discharge a touch spell\non the round you cast it, you can hold the charge (postpone the discharge of\nthe spell) indefinitely. You can make touch attacks round after round. If you\ncast another spell, the touch spell dissipates.</span></p><p>Some\ntouch spellsallow you to touch multiple targets as part of the spell.\nYou can’t hold the charge of such a spell; you must touch all targets of the\nspell in the same round that you finish casting the spell.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Discharge:</span><span> Occasionally a spells\nlasts for a set duration or until triggered or discharged.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">(D)\nDismissible:</span><span>\nIf the Duration line ends with “(D),” you can dismiss the spell at will. You\nmust be within range of the spell’s effect and must speak words of dismissal,\nwhich are usually a modified form of the spell’s verbal component. If the spell\nhas no verbal component, you can dismiss the effect with a gesture. Dismissing\na spell is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</span></p><p>A\nspell that depends on concentration is dismissible by its very nature, and\ndismissing it does not take an action, since all you have to do to end the\nspell is to stop concentrating on your turn.</p></section><section id=\"h3-28-saving-throw\"><h3>내성 굴림</h3><p>Usually\na harmful spell allows a target to make a saving throw to avoid some or all of\nthe effect. The Saving Throw entry in a spell description defines which type of\nsaving throw the spell allows and describes how saving throws against the spell\nwork.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Negates:\n</span><span>The spell\nhas no effect on a subject that makes a successful saving throw.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Partial:</span><span> The spell causes an\neffect on its subject. A successful saving throw means that some lesser effect\noccurs.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Half:</span><span> The spell deals damage,\nand a successful saving throw halves the damage taken (round down).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">None:</span><span> No saving throw is\nallowed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Disbelief:</span><span> A successful save lets\nthe subject ignore the effect. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">(object):</span><span> The spell can be cast on\nobjects, which receive saving throws only if they are magical or if they are\nattended (held, worn, grasped, or the like) by a creature resisting the spell,\nin which case the object uses the creature’s saving throw bonus unless its own\nbonus is greater. (This notation does not mean that a spell can be cast only on\nobjects. Some spells of this sort can be cast on creatures or objects.) A magic\nitem’s saving throw bonuses are each equal to 2 + one-half the item’s caster\nlevel. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">(harmless):</span><span> The spell is usually\nbeneficial, not harmful, but a targeted creature can attempt a saving throw if\nit desires.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Saving\nThrow Difficulty Class:</span><span> A saving throw against your spell has a DC of 10 + the level\nof the spell + your bonus for the relevant ability (Intelligence for a wizard,\nCharisma for a sorcerer or bard, or Wisdom for a cleric, druid, paladin, or\nranger). A spell’s level can vary depending on your class. Always use the spell\nlevel applicable to your class.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Succeeding\non a Saving Throw: </span><span>A creature that successfully saves against a spell that has\nno obvious physical effects feels a hostile force or a tingle, but cannot\ndeduce the exact nature of the attack. Likewise, if a creature’s saving throw\nsucceeds against a targeted spell you sense that the spell has failed. You do\nnot sense when creatures succeed on saves against effect and area spells.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Automatic\nFailures and Successes:</span><span> A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a saving throw is always\na failure, and the spell may cause damage to exposed items (see Items Surviving\nafter a Saving Throw, below). A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a\nsuccess.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Voluntarily\nGiving up a Saving Throw:</span><span> A creature can voluntarily forego a saving throw and\nwillingly accept a spell’s result. Even a character with a special resistance\nto magic can suppress this quality.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Items\nSurviving after a Saving Throw:</span><span> Unless the descriptive text for the spell specifies\notherwise, all items carried or worn by a creature are assumed to survive a\nmagical attack. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw against the\neffect, however, an exposed item is harmed (if the attack can harm objects).\nRefer to Table: Items Affected by Magical Attacks. Determine which four objects\ncarried or worn by the creature are most likely to be affected and roll\nrandomly among them. The randomly determined item must make a saving throw\nagainst the attack form and take whatever damage the attack deal.</span></p><p>If\nan item is not carried or worn and is not magical, it does not get a saving\nthrow. It simply is dealt the appropriate damage.</p><div class=\"table-container\"><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 28.1251em;\"><tbody style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"><tr style=\"break-inside: avoid;

If your spell is being resisted by a\ncreature with spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 +\ncaster level) at least equal to the creature’s spell resistance for the spell\nto affect that creature. The defender’s spell resistance is like an Armor Class\nagainst magical attacks. Include any adjustments to your caster level to this\ncaster level check.</p><p>The\nSpell Resistance entry and the descriptive text of a spell description tell you\nwhether spell resistance protects creatures from the spell. In many cases,\nspell resistance applies only when a resistant creature is targeted by the\nspell, not when a resistant creature encounters a spell that is already in\nplace.</p><p>The\nterms “object” and “harmless” mean the same thing for spell resistance as they\ndo for saving throws.

Her high\nIntelligence score might allow her to prepare a few extra spells. She can\nprepare the same spell more than once, but each preparation counts as one spell\ntoward her daily limit. To prepare a spell the wizard must have an Intelligence\nscore of at least 10 + the spell’s level.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Rest:\n</span><span>To\nprepare her daily spells, a wizard must first sleep for 8 hours. The wizard\ndoes not have to slumber for every minute of the time, but she must refrain\nfrom movement, combat, spellcasting, skill use, conversation, or any other\nfairly demanding physical or mental task during the rest period. If her rest is\ninterrupted, each interruption adds 1 hour to the total amount of time she has\nto rest in order to clear her mind, and she must have at least 1 hour of\nuninterrupted rest immediately prior to preparing her spells. If the character\ndoes not need to sleep for some reason, she still must have 8 hours of restful\ncalm before preparing any spells. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Recent\nCasting Limit/Rest Interruptions:</span><span> If a wizard has cast spells recently, the drain on her\nresources reduces her capacity to prepare new spells. When she prepares spells\nfor the coming day, all the spells she has cast within the last 8 hours count\nagainst her daily limit.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Preparation\nEnvironment:</span><span>\nTo prepare any spell, a wizard must have enough peace, quiet, and comfort to\nallow for proper concentration. The wizard’s surroundings need not be\nluxurious, but they must be free from overt distractions. Exposure to inclement\nweather prevents the necessary concentration, as does any injury or failed\nsaving throw the character might experience while studying. Wizards also must\nhave access to their spellbooks to study from and sufficient light to read them\nby. There is one major exception: A wizard can prepare a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">read magic </span>spell\neven without a spellbook. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Spell\nPreparation Time:</span><span> After resting, a wizard must study her spellbook to prepare\nany spells that day. If she wants to prepare all her spells, the process takes\n1 hour. Preparing some smaller portion of her daily capacity takes a\nproportionally smaller amount of time, but always at least 15 minutes, the\nminimum time required to achieve the proper mental state.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Spell\nSelection and Preparation:</span><span> Until she prepares spells from her spellbook, the only\nspells a wizard has available to cast are the ones that she already had\nprepared from the previous day and has not yet used. During the study period,\nshe chooses which spells to prepare. If a wizard already has spells prepared\n(from the previous day) that she has not cast, she can abandon some or all of\nthem to make room for new spells.</span></p><p>When\npreparing spells for the day, a wizard can leave some of these spell slots\nopen. Later during that day, she can repeat the preparation process as often as\nshe likes, time and circumstances permitting. During these extra sessions of\npreparation, the wizard can fill these unused spell slots. She cannot, however,\nabandon a previously prepared spell to replace it with another one or fill a\nslot that is empty because she has cast a spell in the meantime. That sort of\npreparation requires a mind fresh from rest. Like the first session of the day,\nthis preparation takes at least 15 minutes, and it takes longer if the wizard\nprepares more than one-quarter of her spells.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Spell\nSlots:</span><span>\nThe various character class tables show how many spells of each level a\ncharacter can cast per day. These openings for daily spells are called spell\nslots. A spellcaster always has the option to fill a higher-level spell slot\nwith a lower-level spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high enough ability score\nto cast spells that would otherwise be his or her due still gets the slots but\nmust fill them with spells of lower level.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Prepared\nSpell Retention:</span><span>\nOnce a wizard prepares a spell, it remains in her mind as a nearly cast spell\nuntil she uses the prescribed components to complete and trigger it or until\nshe abandons it. Certain other events, such as the effects of magic items or\nspecial attacks from monsters, can wipe a prepared spell from a character’s\nmind.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Death\nand Prepared Spell Retention:</span><span> If a spellcaster dies, all prepared spells stored in his or\nher mind are wiped away. Potent magic (such as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">raise dead, resurrection, </span>or\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">true resurrection</span>) can recover the lost energy when it recovers the\ncharacter.</span></p></section><section id=\"h3-33-arcane-magical-writings\"><h3>비전 마법 작성</h3><p>To\nrecord an arcane spell in written form, a character uses complex notation that\ndescribes the magical forces involved in the spell. The writer uses the same\nsystem no matter what her native language or culture. However, each character uses\nthe system in her own way. Another person’s magical writing remains\nincomprehensible to even the most powerful wizard until she takes time to study\nand decipher it.</p><p>To\ndecipher an arcane magical writing (such as a single spell in written form in\nanother’s spellbook or on a scroll), a character must make a Spellcraft check\n(DC 20 + the spell’s level). If the skill check fails, the character cannot\nattempt to read that particular spell again until the next day. A <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">read magic\n</span>spell automatically deciphers a magical writing without a skill check. If\nthe person who created the magical writing is on hand to help the reader,\nsuccess is also automatic.</p><p>Once\na character deciphers a particular magical writing, she does not need to\ndecipher it again. Deciphering a magical writing allows the reader to identify\nthe spell and gives some idea of its effects (as explained in the spell\ndescription). If the magical writing was a scroll and the reader can cast\narcane spells, she can attempt to use the scroll.</p><p>Wizard\nSpells and Borrowed Spellbooks</p><p>A\nwizard can use a borrowed spellbook to prepare a spell she already knows and\nhas recorded in her own spellbook, but preparation success is not assured.\nFirst, the wizard must decipher the writing in the book (see Arcane Magical Writings,\nabove). Once a spell from another spellcaster’s book is deciphered, the reader\nmust make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell’s level) to prepare the spell. If\nthe check succeeds, the wizard can prepare the spell. She must repeat the check\nto prepare the spell again, no matter how many times she has prepared it\nbefore. If the check fails, she cannot try to prepare the spell from the same\nsource again until the next day. (However, as explained above, she does not\nneed to repeat a check to decipher the writing.)</p><p>Adding\nSpells to a Wizard’s Spellbook</p><p>Wizards\ncan add new spells to their spellbooks through several methods. If a wizard has\nchosen to specialize in a school of magic, she can learn spells only from\nschools whose spells she can cast.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Spells\nGained at a New Level: </span><span>Wizards perform a certain amount of spell research between\nadventures. Each time a character attains a new wizard level, she gains two\nspells of her choice to add to her spellbook. The two free spells must be of\nspell levels she can cast. If she has chosen to specialize in a school of\nmagic, one of the two free spells must be from her specialty school.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Spells\nCopied from Another’s Spellbook or a Scroll:</span><span> A wizard can also add a spell to her\nbook whenever she encounters one on a magic scroll or in another wizard’s\nspellbook. No matter what the spell’s source, the wizard must first decipher\nthe magical writing (see Arcane Magical Writings, above). Next, she must spend\na day studying the spell. At the end of the day, she must make a Spellcraft\ncheck (DC 15 + spell’s level). A wizard who has specialized in a school of\nspells gains a +2 bonus on the Spellcraft check if the new spell is from her\nspecialty school. She cannot, however, learn any spells from her prohibited\nschools. If the check succeeds, the wizard understands the spell and can copy\nit into her spellbook (see Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook, below). The\nprocess leaves a spellbook that was copied from unharmed, but a spell\nsuccessfully copied from a magic scroll disappears from the parchment.</span></p><p>If\nthe check fails, the wizard cannot understand or copy the spell. She cannot\nattempt to learn or copy that spell again until she gains another rank in\nSpellcraft. A spell that was being copied from a scroll does not vanish from\nthe scroll.</p><p>In\nmost cases, wizards charge a fee for the privilege of copying spells from their\nspellbooks. This fee is usually equal to the spell’s level x50 gp.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Independent\nResearch:</span><span>\nA wizard also can research a spell independently, duplicating an existing spell\nor creating an entirely new one.</span></p><p>Writing\na New Spell into a Spellbook</p><p>Once\na wizard understands a new spell, she can record it into her spellbook.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Time:</span><span> The process takes 24\nhours, regardless of the spell’s level.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Space\nin the Spellbook:</span><span> A spell takes up one page of the spellbook per spell level.\nEven a 0-level spell (cantrip) takes one page. A spellbook has one hundred\npages.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Materials\nand Costs:</span><span>\nMaterials for writing the spell cost 100 gp per page.</span></p><p>Note\nthat a wizard does not have to pay these costs in time or gold for the spells\nshe gains for free at each new level. </p><p>Replacing\nand Copying Spellbooks</p><p>A\nwizard can use the procedure for learning a spell to reconstruct a lost\nspellbook. If she already has a particular spell prepared, she can write it\ndirectly into a new book at a cost of 100 gp per page (as noted in Writing a\nNew Spell into a Spellbook, above). The process wipes the prepared spell from\nher mind, just as casting it would. If she does not have the spell prepared,\nshe can prepare it from a borrowed spellbook and then write it into a new book.</p><p>Duplicating\nan existing spellbook uses the same procedure as replacing it, but the task is\nmuch easier. The time requirement and cost per page are halved.</p><p>Selling\na Spellbook</p><p>Captured\nspellbooks can be sold for a gp amount equal to one-half the cost of purchasing\nand inscribing the spells within (that is, one-half of 100 gp per page of\nspells). A spellbook entirely filled with spells (that is, with one hundred\npages of spells inscribed in it) is worth 5,000 gp.</p></section><section id=\"h3-34-sorcerers-and-bards\"><h3>소서러와 음유시인</h3><p>Sorcerers\nand bards cast arcane spells, but they do not have spellbooks and do not\nprepare their spells. A sorcerer’s or bard’s class level limits the number of\nspells he can cast (see these class descriptions). His high Charisma score\nmight allow him to cast a few extra spells. A member of either class must have\na Charisma score of at least 10 + a spell’s level to cast the spell.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Daily\nReadying of Spells:</span><span> Each day, sorcerers and bards must focus their minds on the\ntask of casting their spells. A sorcerer or bard needs 8 hours of rest (just\nlike a wizard), after which he spends 15 minutes concentrating. (A bard must\nsing, recite, or play an instrument of some kind while concentrating.) During\nthis period, the sorcerer or bard readies his mind to cast his daily allotment\nof spells. Without such a period to refresh himself, the character does not\nregain the spell slots he used up the day before.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Recent\nCasting Limit: </span><span>As\nwith wizards, any spells cast within the last 8 hours count against the\nsorcerer’s or bard’s daily limit.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Adding\nSpells to a Sorcerer’s or Bard’s Repertoire:</span><span> A sorcerer or bard gains spells each\ntime he attains a new level in his class and never gains spells any other way.\nWhen your sorcerer or bard gains a new level, consult Table: Bard Spells Known\nor Table: Sorcerer Spells Known to learn how many spells from the appropriate\nspell list he now knows. With permission, sorcerers and bards can also select\nthe spells they gain from new and unusual spells that they have gained some\nunderstanding of.</span></p></section></section><section id=\"h2-35-divine-spells\"><h2>신성 주문</h2><p>Clerics,\ndruids, experienced paladins, and experienced rangers can cast divine spells.\nUnlike arcane spells, divine spells draw power from a divine source. Clerics\ngain spell power from deities or from divine forces. The divine force of nature\npowers druid and ranger spells. The divine forces of law and good power paladin\nspells. Divine spells tend to focus on healing and protection and are less\nflashy, destructive, and disruptive than arcane spells.</p><section id=\"h3-36-preparing-divine-spells\"><h3>신성 주문 준비</h3><p>Divine\nspellcasters prepare their spells in largely the same manner as wizards do, but\nwith a few differences. The relevant ability for divine spells is Wisdom. To\nprepare a divine spell, a character must have a Wisdom score of 10 + the\nspell’s level. Likewise, bonus spells are based on Wisdom.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Time\nof Day:</span><span> A\ndivine spellcaster chooses and prepares spells ahead of time, just as a wizard\ndoes. However, a divine spellcaster does not require a period of rest to\nprepare spells. Instead, the character chooses a particular part of the day to\npray and receive spells. The time is usually associated with some daily event.\nIf some event prevents a character from praying at the proper time, he must do\nso as soon as possible. If the character does not stop to pray for spells at\nthe first opportunity, he must wait until the next day to prepare spells.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Spell\nSelection and Preparation:</span><span> A divine spellcaster selects and prepares spells ahead of\ntime through prayer and meditation at a particular time of day. The time\nrequired to prepare spells is the same as it is for a wizard (1 hour), as is\nthe requirement for a relatively peaceful environment. A divine spellcaster\ndoes not have to prepare all his spells at once. However, the character’s mind\nis considered fresh only during his or her first daily spell preparation, so a\ndivine spellcaster cannot fill a slot that is empty because he or she has cast\na spell or abandoned a previously prepared spell.</span></p><p>Divine\nspellcasters do not require spellbooks. However, such a character’s spell\nselection is limited to the spells on the list for his or her class. Clerics,\ndruids, paladins, and rangers have separate spell lists. A cleric also has\naccess to two domains determined during his character creation. Each domain\ngives him access to a domain spell at each spell level from 1st to 9th, as well\nas a special granted power. With access to two domain spells at each spell\nlevel—one from each of his two domains—a cleric must prepare, as an extra\ndomain spell, one or the other each day for each level of spell he can cast. If\na domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, it can be prepared only in a\ndomain spell slot.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Spell\nSlots:</span><span>\nThe character class tables show how many spells of each level a character can\ncast per day.</span></p><p>These\nopenings for daily spells are called spell slots. A spellcaster always has the\noption to fill a higher-level spell slot with a lower level spell. A\nspellcaster who lacks a high enough ability score to cast spells that would\notherwise be his or her due still gets the slots but must fill them with spells\nof lower level. </p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Recent\nCasting Limit:</span><span>\nAs with arcane spells, at the time of preparation any spells cast within the\nprevious 8 hours count against the number of spells that can be prepared.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Spontaneous\nCasting of <span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: 700;\">Cure </span>and <span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: 700;\">Inflict </span>Spells:</span><span> A good cleric (or a cleric of a good\ndeity) can spontaneously cast a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">cure </span>spell in place of a prepared spell\nof the same level or higher, but not in place of a domain spell.
