Adamantine is so costly that 무기 and 갑옷 made from it are always of masterwork\n            quality; the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below. Thus, adamantine 무기 and ammunition\n            have a +1 enhancement 보너스 on 명중 굴림, and 갑옷 check 페널티 of adamantine 갑옷 is lessened by 1\n            compared to ordinary 갑옷 of its type. Items without metal parts cannot be made from adamantine.

Heavy 갑옷 are treated as medium, and medium 갑옷 are treated as 빛, but 빛 갑옷 are still\n            treated as 빛. 주문 실패 chances for 갑옷 and 방패 made from mithral are decreased by 10%, maximum 민첩\n            보너스 is increased by 2, and 갑옷 check 페널티 are lessened by 3 (to a minimum of 0).</span\n          >\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          An item made from mithral weighs half as much as the same item made from other metals.
