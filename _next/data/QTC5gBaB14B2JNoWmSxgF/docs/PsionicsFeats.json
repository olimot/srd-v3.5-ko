(In other words, they either have a power point reserve or have\npsi-like abilities.)</p><p>Because psionic\nfeats are supernatural abilities—a departure from the general rule that feats\ndo not grant supernatural abilities—they cannot be disrupted in combat (as\npowers can be) and generally do not provoke attacks of opportunity (except as\nnoted in their descriptions). Supernatural abilities are not subject to power\nresistance and cannot be dispelled; however, they do not function in areas\nwhere psionics is suppressed, such as a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">null psionics field. </span>Leaving\nsuch an area immediately allows psionic feats to be used.</p><p>Many psionic\nfeats can be used only when you are psionically focused; others require you to\nexpend your psionic focus to gain their benefit. Expending your psionic focus\ndoes not require an action; it is part of another action (such as using a\nfeat). When you expend your psionic focus, it applies only to the action for\nwhich you expended it.</p><section id=\"h3-1-psionic-item-creation-feats\"><h3>사이오닉 아이템 제작 특기</h3><p>Manifesters can\nuse their personal power to create lasting psionic items. Doing so, however, is\ndraining. A manifester must put a little of himself or herself into every\npsionic item he or she creates.</p><p>A psionic item\ncreation feat lets a manifester create a psionic item of a certain type.\nRegardless of the type of items they involve, the various item creation feats\nall have certain features in common.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">XP Cost:</span><span> Power and energy that the manifester would normally keep is\nexpended when making a psionic item. The experience point cost of using a\npsionic item creation feat equals 1/25 the cost of the item in gold pieces. A\ncharacter cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a level.\nHowever, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level, he or she can\nimmediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance\na level.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Raw\nMaterials Cost:</span><span> Creating a psionic item requires\ncostly components, most of which are consumed in the process. The cost of these\nmaterials equals 1/2 the cost of the item.</span></p><p>Using a psionic\nitem creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or psionic workshop,\nspecial tools, and other equipment. A character generally has access to what he\nor she needs unless unusual circumstances apply (such as if he’s traveling far\nfrom home).</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Time:</span><span> The time to create a psionic item depends on the feat and the cost\nof the item. The minimum time is one day.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Item Cost:</span><span> Craft Dorje, Imprint Stone, and Scribe Tattoo create items that\ndirectly reproduce the effects of powers, and the strength of these items\ndepends on their manifester level—that is, a power from such an item has the\nstrength it would have if manifested by a manifester of that level. Often, that\nis the minimum manifester level necessary to manifest the power. (Randomly\ndiscovered items usually follow this rule.) However, when making such an item,\nthe item’s strength can be set higher than the minimum. Any time a character\ncreates an item using a power augmented by spending additional power points,\nthe character’s effective manifester level for the purpose of calculating the\nitem’s cost increases by 1 for each 1 additional power point spent.\n(Augmentation is a feature of many powers that allows the power to be amplified\nin various ways if additional power points are spent.) All other\nlevel-dependent parameters of the power forged into the item are set according\nto the effective manifester level.</span></p><p>The price of\npsionic items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) depends\non the level of the power and a character’s manifester level. The character’s\nmanifester level must be high enough that the item creator can manifest the\npower at the chosen level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the character’s\nmanifester level by the power level, then multiply the result by a constant, as\nshown below.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Power\nStones: </span><span>Base price = power level x manifester level\nx 25 gp</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Psionic\nTattoos: </span><span>Base price = power level x manifester\nlevel x 50 gp</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dorjes: </span><span>Base price = power level x manifester level x 750 gp</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Extra Costs:</span><span> Any dorje, power stone, or psionic tattoo that stores a power with\nan XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. </span></p><p>For psionic\ntattoos and power stones, the creator must pay the XP cost when creating the\nitem. For a dorje, the creator must pay fifty times the XP cost. </p><p>Some psionic\nitems similarly incur extra costs in XP, as noted in their descriptions.</p></section><section id=\"h3-2-metapsionic-feats\"><h3>메타사이오닉 특기</h3><p>As a\nmanifester’s knowledge of psionics grows, he can learn to manifest powers in\nways slightly different from how the powers were originally designed or\nlearned. Of course, manifesting a power while using a metapsionic feat is more\nexpensive than manifesting the power normally.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Manifesting\nTime:</span><span> Powers manifested using metapsionic feats\ntake the same time as manifesting the powers normally unless the feat\ndescription specifically says otherwise.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Manifestation\nCost:</span><span> To use a metapsionic feat, a psionic\ncharacter must both expend his psionic focus (see the Concentration skill\ndescription) and pay an increased power point cost as given in the feat\ndescription.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Limits on\nUse:</span><span> As with all powers, you cannot spend more\npower points on a power than your manifester level. Metapsionic feats merely\nlet you manifest powers in different ways; they do not let you violate this\nrule. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Effects of\nMetapsionic Feats on a Power:</span><span> In all ways, a\nmetapsionic power operates at its original power level, even though it costs\nadditional power points. The modifications to a power made by a metapsionic\nfeat have only their noted effect on the power. A manifester can’t use a\nmetapsionic feat to alter a power being cast from a power stone, dorje, or\nother device.</span></p><p>Manifesting a\npower modified by the Quicken Power feat does not provoke attacks of\nopportunity.</p><p>Some\nmetapsionic feats apply only to certain powers, as described in each specific\nfeat entry.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Psionic\nItems and Metapsionic Powers:</span><span> With the right\npsionic item creation feat, you can store a metapsionic power in a power stone,\npsionic tattoo, or dorje. Level limits for psionic tattoos apply to the power’s\nhigher metapsionic level. </span></p><p>A character\ndoesn’t need the appropriate metapsionic feat to activate an item in which a\nmetapsionic power is stored, but does need the metapsionic feat to create such\nan item.</p></section><section id=\"h2-3-feat-descriptions\"><h2>특기 설명</h2><p>These feat\ndescriptions follow the standard format.</p><section id=\"h3-4-aligned-attack-psionic\"><h3>성향 공격 [사이오닉]</h3><p>Your melee or\nranged attack overcomes your opponent’s alignment-based damage reduction and\ndeals additional damage.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Prerequisite:</span><span> Base attack bonus +6.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Benefit:</span><span> When you take this feat, choose either chaos, good, evil or law.\n(Your choice must match one of your alignment components.

Once per round when you would normally be hit by a\nprojectile or a thrown weapon no more than one size category larger than your\nsize, you can deflect the attack so that you take no damage from it.

Scribing a psionic tattoo\ntakes one day. When you create a psionic tattoo, you set the manifester level.\nThe manifester level must be sufficient to manifest the power in question and\nno higher than your own level. The base price of a psionic tattoo is its power\nlevel x its manifester level x 50 gp.

In\naddition to the costs derived from the base price, you must pay the XP when\ncreating the tattoo.</p></section><section id=\"h3-72-sidestep-charge-psionic\"><h3>Sidestep Charge [사이오닉]</h3><p>You are skilled\nat dodging past charging opponents and taking advantage when they miss.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Prerequisite:</span><span> Dex 13, Dodge.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Benefit:</span><span> You get a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against charge attacks. If\na charging opponent fails to make a successful attack against you, you gain an\nimmediate attack of opportunity.

You can split\npsionic rays you manifest. The split ray affects any two targets that are both\nwithin the power’s range and within 30 feet of each other.

Make your attack of opportunity normally. If you hit\nyour foe, he must succeed on a Reflex save against a DC of 10 + your damage\nroll (the opponent does not actually take damage), or immediately halt as if he\nhad used up his move actions for the round.</span></p><p>Since you use\nthe Stand Still feat in place of your attack of opportunity, you can do so only\na number of times per round equal to the number of times per round you could\nmake an attack of opportunity (normally just one).</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Normal:</span><span> Attacks of opportunity cannot halt your foes in their tracks.</span></p></section><section id=\"h3-76-talented-psionic\"><h3>Talented [사이오닉]</h3><p>You can\noverchannel powers with less cost to yourself.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Prerequisite:</span><span> Overchannel.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus.

You can twin\na power. Manifesting a power altered by this feat causes the power to take\neffect twice on the area or target, as if you were simultaneously manifesting\nthe same power two times on the same location or target. Any variables in the\npower (such as duration, number of targets, and so on) are the same for both of\nthe resulting powers. The target experiences all the effects of both powers\nindividually and receives a saving throw (if applicable) for each. In some\ncases, such as a twinned <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">psionic charm</span>, failing both saving throws\nresults in redundant effects (although, in this example, any ally of the target\nwould have to succeed on two dispel attempts to free the target from the charm\neffect).</span></p><p>Using this feat\nincreases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power’s total cost cannot\nexceed your manifester level.</p></section><section id=\"h3-78-unavoidable-strike-psionic\"><h3>Unavoidable Strike [사이오닉]</h3><p>You can make an\nunarmed strike or use a natural weapon against your foe as if delivering a\ntouch attack.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Prerequisite:</span><span> Str 13, Psionic Fist, base attack bonus +5.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can\nresolve your unarmed strike or attack with a natural weapon as a touch attack.</span></p><p>You must decide\nwhether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack.

Your mental\nstrength is enough to overcome some otherwise disabling conditions. You can\nmanifest an unconditional power when you are dazed, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">confused, </span>nauseated,\nshaken, or stunned.</span></p><p>Only personal\npowers and powers that affect your person can be manifested as unconditional\npowers.</p><p>Using this feat\nincreases the power point cost of the power by 8.

The height you can achieve\non the wall is limited only by this movement restriction. If you do not end\nyour move on a horizontal surface, you fall prone, taking falling damage as\nappropriate for your distance above the ground. Treat the wall as a normal\nfloor for the purpose of measuring your movement. Passing from floor to wall or\nwall to floor costs no movement; you can change surfaces freely. Opponents on\nthe ground can make attacks of opportunity as you move up the wall.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Special:</span><span> You can take other move actions in conjunction with moving along a\nwall. For instance, the Spring Attack feat allows you to make an attack from\nthe wall against a foe standing on the ground who is within the area you\nthreaten; however, if you are somehow prevented from completing your move, you\nfall. Likewise, you could tumble along the wall to avoid attacks of opportunity.</span></p></section><section id=\"h3-81-widen-power-metapsionic\"><h3>Widen Power [메타사이오닉]</h3><p>You can\nincrease the area of your powers.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can alter\na burst, emanation, line, or spread-shaped power to increase its area. (Powers\nthat do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this\nfeat.)

As a psionic character, you gain a\nreserve of 2 power points and can take psionic feats, metapsionic feats, and\npsionic item creation feats. You do not, however, gain the ability to manifest\npowers simply by virtue of having this feat.</span></p></section><section id=\"h3-83-wounding-attack-psionic\"><h3>Wounding Attack [사이오닉]</h3><p>Your vicious\nattacks wound your foe.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Prerequisite:</span><span> Base attack bonus +8.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can make\nan attack with such vicious force that you wound your opponent. A wound deals 1\npoint of Constitution damage to your foe in addition to the usual damage dealt.</span></p><p>You must decide\nwhether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack.
