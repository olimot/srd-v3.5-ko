Ability drain, however, is permanent, though <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">restoration </span>can\nrestore even those lost ability score points.</p><p>While\nany loss is debilitating, losing all points in an ability score can be\ndevastating.</p><p>•\nStrength 0 means that the character cannot move at all. He lies helpless on the\nground.</p><p>•\nDexterity 0 means that the character cannot move at all. He stands motionless,\nrigid, and helpless.</p><p>•\nConstitution 0 means that the character is dead.</p><p>•\nIntelligence 0 means that the character cannot think and is unconscious in a\ncoma-like stupor, helpless.</p><p>•\nWisdom 0 means that the character is withdrawn into a deep sleep filled with\nnightmares, helpless.</p><p>•\nCharisma 0 means that the character is withdrawn into a catatonic, coma-like\nstupor, helpless.</p><p>Keeping\ntrack of negative ability score points is never necessary. A character’s\nability score can’t drop below 0.</p><p>Having\na score of 0 in an ability is different from having no ability score\nwhatsoever.</p><p>Some\nspells or abilities impose an effective ability score reduction, which is\ndifferent from ability score loss. Any such reduction disappears at the end of\nthe spell’s or ability’s duration, and the ability score immediately returns to\nits former value.</p><p>If\na character’s Constitution score drops, then he loses 1 hit point per Hit Die\nfor every point by which his Constitution modifier drops. A hit point score\ncan’t be reduced by Constitution damage or drain to less than 1 hit point per\nHit Die.</p><p>The\nability that some creatures have to drain ability scores is a supernatural one,\nrequiring some sort of attack. Such creatures do not drain abilities from\nenemies when the enemies strike them, even with unarmed attacks or natural\nweapons.</p></section><section id=\"h3-3-antimagic\"><h3>항마</h3><p>An\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">antimagic field </span>spell or effect cancels magic altogether. An antimagic\neffect has the following powers and characteristics.</p><p>•\nNo supernatural ability, spell-like ability, or spell works in an area of\nantimagic (but extraordinary abilities still work).</p><p>•\nAntimagic does not dispel magic; it suppresses it. Once a magical effect is no\nlonger affected by the antimagic (the antimagic fades, the center of the effect\nmoves away, and so on), the magic returns. Spells that still have part of their\nduration left begin functioning again, magic items are once again useful, and\nso forth.</p><p>•\nSpell areas that include both an antimagic area and a normal area, but are not\ncentered in the antimagic area, still function in the normal area. If the\nspell’s center is in the antimagic area, then the spell is suppressed.</p><p>•\nGolems and other constructs, elementals, outsiders, and corporeal undead, still\nfunction in an antimagic area (though the antimagic area suppresses their\nspellcasting and their supernatural and spell-like abilities normally). If such\ncreatures are summoned or conjured, however, see below. </p><p>•\nSummoned or conjured creatures of any type, as well as incorporeal undead, wink\nout if they enter the area of an antimagic effect. They reappear in the same\nspot once the field goes away.</p><p>•\nMagic items with continuous effectsdo not function in the area of an\nantimagic effect, but their effects are not canceled (so the contents of a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">bag\nof holding</span> are unavailable, but neither spill out nor disappear forever).</p><p>•\nTwo antimagic areas in the same place do not cancel each other out, nor do they\nstack.</p><p>•\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Wall of force, prismatic wall, </span>and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prismatic sphere </span>are not\naffected by antimagic. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Break enchantment, dispel magic, </span>and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">greater\ndispel magic </span>spells do not dispel antimagic. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Mage’s disjunction </span>has\na 1% chance per caster level of destroying an <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">antimagic field. </span>If the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">antimagic\nfield </span>survives the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">disjunction, </span>no items within it are disjoined.</p></section><section id=\"h3-4-blindsight-and-blindsense\"><h3>시각 차단 및 감각 차단</h3><p>Some\ncreatures have blindsight, the extraordinary ability to use a nonvisual sense\n(or a combination of such senses) to operate effectively without vision. Such\nsense may include sensitivity to vibrations, acute scent, keen hearing, or\necholocation. This ability makes invisibility and concealment (even magical\ndarkness) irrelevant to the creature (though it still can’t see ethereal\ncreatures). This ability operates out to a range specified in the creature\ndescription.</p><p>•\nBlindsight never allows a creature to distinguish color or visual contrast. A\ncreature cannot read with blindsight.</p><p>•\nBlindsight does not subject a creature to gaze attacks (even though darkvision\ndoes).</p><p>•\nBlinding attacks do not penalize creatures using blindsight. </p><p>•\nDeafening attacks thwart blindsight if it relies on hearing.</p><p>•\nBlindsight works underwater but not in a vacuum.</p><p>•\nBlindsight negates displacement and blur effects.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Blindsense:</span><span> Other creatures have\nblindsense, a lesser ability that lets the creature notice things it cannot\nsee, but without the precision of blindsight. The creature with blindsense\nusually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice and locate\ncreatures within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of\neffect to that creature. Any opponent the creature cannot see has total\nconcealment (50% miss chance) against the creature with blindsense, and the\nblindsensing creature still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that\nhave concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with\nblindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to\nArmor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see.</span></p></section><section id=\"h3-5-breath-weapon\"><h3>브레스 무기</h3><p>A\ncreature attacking with a breath weapon is actually expelling something from\nits mouth (rather than conjuring it by means of a spell or some other magical\neffect). Most creatures with breath weapons are limited to a number of uses per\nday or by a minimum length of time that must pass between uses. Such creatures\nare usually smart enough to save their breath weapon until they really need it.</p><p>•\nUsing a breath weapon is typically a standard action.</p><p>•\nNo attack roll is necessary. The breath simply fills its stated area.</p><p>•\nAny character caught in the area must make the appropriate saving throw or\nsuffer the breath weapon’s full effect. In many cases, a character who succeeds\non his saving throw still takes half damage or some other reduced effect.</p><p>•\nBreath weapons are supernatural abilities except where noted.</p><p>•\nCreatures are immune to their own breath weapons.</p><p>•\nCreatures unable to breathe can still use breath weapons. (The term is\nsomething of a misnomer.)</p></section><section id=\"h3-6-charm-and-compulsion\"><h3>매혹과 명령</h3><p>Many\nabilities and spells can cloud the minds of characters and monsters, leaving\nthem unable to tell friend from foe—or worse yet, deceiving them into thinking\nthat their former friends are now their worst enemies. Two general types of\nenchantments affect characters and creatures: charms and compulsions.</p><p>Charming\nanother creature gives the charming character the ability to befriend and\nsuggest courses of actions to his minion, but the servitude is not absolute or\nmindless. Charms of this type include the various <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charm </span>spells. Essentially,\na <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charmed </span>character retains free will but makes choices according to a\nskewed view of the world.</p><p>•\nA <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charmed </span>creature doesn’t gain any magical ability to understand his\nnew friend’s language.</p><p>•\nA <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charmed </span>character retains his original alignment and allegiances,\ngenerally with the exception that he now regards the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charming </span>creature\nas a dear friend and will give great weight to his suggestions and directions.</p><p>•\nA <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charmed </span>character fights his former allies only if they threaten his\nnew friend, and even then he uses the least lethal means at his disposal as\nlong as these tactics show any possibility of success (just as he would in a\nfight between two actual friends).</p><p>•\nA <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charmed </span>character is entitled to an opposed Charisma check against his\nmaster in order to resist instructions or commands that would make him do\nsomething he wouldn’t normally do even for a close friend. If he succeeds, he\ndecides not to go along with that order but remains <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charmed.</span></p><p>•\nA <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charmed </span>character never obeys a command that is obviously suicidal or\ngrievously harmful to her.</p><p>•\nIf the charming creature commands his minion to do something that the\ninfluenced character would be violently opposed to, the subject may attempt a\nnew saving throw to break free of the influence altogether.</p><p>•\nA <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charmed </span>character who is openly attacked by the creature who <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">charmed\n</span>him or by that creature’s apparent allies is automatically freed of the\nspell or effect.</p><p>Compulsion\nis a different matter altogether. A compulsion overrides the subject’s free will\nin some way or simply changes the way the subject’s mind works. A charm makes\nthe subject a friend of the caster; a compulsion makes the subject obey the\ncaster.</p><p>Regardless\nof whether a character is charmed or compelled, he won’t volunteer information\nor tactics that his master doesn’t ask for.</p></section><section id=\"h3-7-cold-immunity\"><h3>냉기 내성</h3><p>A\ncreature with cold immunity never takes cold damage. It has vulnerability to\nfire, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from\nfire, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a\nsuccess or failure.</p></section><section id=\"h3-8-damage-reduction\"><h3>피해 감소</h3><p>Some\nmagic creatures have the supernatural ability to instantly heal damage from\nweapons or to ignore blows altogether as though they were invulnerable.</p><p>The\nnumerical part of a creature’s damage reduction is the amount of hit points the\ncreature ignores from normal attacks. Usually, a certain type of weapon can\novercome this reduction. This information is separated from the damage\nreduction number by a slash. Damage reduction may be overcome by special\nmaterials, by magic weapons (any weapon with a +1 or higher enhancement bonus,\nnot counting the enhancement from masterwork quality), certain types of weapons\n(such as slashing or bludgeoning), and weapons imbued with an alignment. If a\ndash follows the slash then the damage reduction is effective against any attack\nthat does not ignore damage reduction.</p><p>Ammunition\nfired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is\ntreated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.\nSimilarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an alignment gains\nthe alignment of that projectile weapon (in addition to any alignment it may\nalready have).</p><p>Whenever\ndamage reduction completely negates the damage from an attack, it also negates\nmost special effects that accompany the attack, such as injury type poison, a\nmonk’s stunning, and injury type disease. Damage reduction does not negate\ntouch attacks, energy damage dealt along with an attack, or energy drains. Nor\ndoes it affect poisons or diseases delivered by inhalation, ingestion, or\ncontact. </p><p>Attacks\nthat deal no damage because of the target’s damage reduction do not disrupt\nspells.</p><p>Spells,\nspell-like abilities, and energy attacks (even nonmagical fire) ignore damage\nreduction.</p><p>Sometimes\ndamage reduction is instant healing. Sometimes damage reduction represents the\ncreature’s tough hide or body,. In either case, characters can see that\nconventional attacks don’t work.</p><p>If\na creature has damage reduction from more than one source, the two forms of\ndamage reduction do not stack. Instead, the creature gets the benefit of the\nbest damage reduction in a given situation. </p></section><section id=\"h3-9-darkvision\"><h3>암흑시야</h3><p>Darkvision\nis the extraordinary ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range\nspecified for the creature. Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot\nbe discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not\nsee otherwise—invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still\nvisible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to\ngaze attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.</p></section><section id=\"h3-10-death-attacks\"><h3>즉사 공격</h3><p>In\nmost cases, a death attack allows the victim a Fortitude save to avoid the\naffect, but if the save fails, the character dies instantly.</p><p>•\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Raise dead </span>doesn’t work on someone killed by a death attack. </p><p>•\nDeath attacks slay instantly. A victim cannot be made stable and thereby kept\nalive.</p><p>•\nIn case it matters, a dead character, no matter how she died, has –10 hit\npoints.</p><p>•\nThe spell <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">death ward </span>protects a character against these attacks.</p></section><section id=\"h3-11-disease\"><h3>질병</h3><p>When\na character is injured by a contaminated attack touches an item smeared with\ndiseased matter, or consumes disease-tainted food or drink, he must make an\nimmediate Fortitude saving throw. If he succeeds, the disease has no effect—his\nimmune system fought off the infection. If he fails, he takes damage after an\nincubation period. Once per day afterward, he must make a successful Fortitude\nsaving throw to avoid repeated damage. Two successful saving throws in a row indicate\nthat he has fought off the disease and recovers, taking no more damage.</p><p>These\nFortitude saving throws can be rolled secretly so that the player doesn’t know\nwhether the disease has taken hold.</p><section id=\"h4-12-disease-descriptions\"><h4>질병 설명</h4><p>Diseases\nhave various symptoms and are spread through a number of vectors.

The creature making\nan energy drain attack draws a portion of its victim’s life force from her.\nMost energy drain attacks require a successful melee attack roll—mere physical\ncontact is not enough. Each successful energy drain attack bestows one or more\nnegative levels on the opponent. A creature takes the following penalties for\neach negative level it has gained.</p><p>–1\non all skill checks and ability checks.</p><p>–1\non attack rolls and saving throws.</p><p>–5\nhit points.</p><p>–1\neffective level (whenever the creature’s level is used in a die roll or\ncalculation, reduce it by one for each negative level). </p><p>If\nthe victim casts spells, she loses access to one spell as if she had cast her\nhighest-level, currently available spell. (If she has more than one spell at\nher highest level, she chooses which she loses.) In addition, when she next\nprepares spells or regains spell slots, she gets one less spell slot at her\nhighest spell level. </p><p>Negative\nlevels remain for 24 hours or until removed with a spell, such as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">restoration.\n</span>After 24 hours, the afflicted creature must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10\n+ 1/2 attacker’s HD + attacker’s Cha modifier). (The DC is provided in the\nattacker’s description.) If the saving throw succeeds, the negative level goes\naway with no harm to the creature. The afflicted creature makes a separate\nsaving throw for each negative level it has gained. If the save fails, the\nnegative level goes away, but the creature’s level is also reduced by one.</p><p>A\ncharacter with negative levels at least equal to her current level, or drained\nbelow 1st level, is instantly slain. Depending on the creature that killed her,\nshe may rise the next night as a monster of that kind. If not, she rises as a\nwight. A creature gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level it\nbestows (though not if the negative level is caused by a spell or similar\neffect).</p></section><section id=\"h3-15-etherealness\"><h3>에테리얼화</h3><p>Phase\nspiders and certain other creatures can exist on the Ethereal Plane.

Things on the Material Plane,\nhowever, look gray, indistinct, and ghostly. An ethereal creature can’t affect\nthe Material Plane, not even magically. An ethereal creature, however,\ninteracts with other ethereal creatures and objects the way material creatures\ninteract with material creatures and objects.</p><p>Even\nif a creature on the Material Plane can see an ethereal creature the ethereal\ncreature is on another plane.

Gaze effects and abjurations also extend from the Material Plane to\nthe Ethereal Plane. None of these effects extend from the Ethereal Plane to the\nMaterial Plane.</p><p>Ethereal\ncreatures move in any direction (including up or down) at will. They do not\nneed to walk on the ground, and material objects don’t block them (though they\ncan’t see while their eyes are within solid material).</p><p>Ghosts\nhave a power called manifestation that allows them to appear on the Material\nPlane as incorporeal creatures.

The only exception is if the invisible creature has a reach\ngreater than 5 feet. In this case, the struck character knows the general\nlocation of the creature but has not pinpointed the exact location.</p><p>If\na character tries to attack an invisible creature whose location he has\npinpointed, he attacks normally, but the invisible creature still benefits from\nfull concealment (and thus a 50% miss chance). A particularly large and slow\ncreature might get a smaller miss chance.</p><p>If\na character tries to attack an invisible creature whose location he has not\npinpointed, have the player choose the space where the character will direct\nthe attack. If the invisible creature is there, conduct the attack normally. If\nthe enemy’s not there, roll the miss chance as if it were there, don’t let the\nplayer see the result, and tell him that the character has missed. That way the\nplayer doesn’t know whether the attack missed because the enemy’s not there or\nbecause you successfully rolled the miss chance.</p><p>If\nan invisible character picks up a visible object, the object remains visible.\nOne could coat an invisible object with flour to at least keep track of its\nposition (until the flour fell off or blew away). An invisible creature can\npick up a small visible item and hide it on his person (tucked in a pocket or\nbehind a cloak) and render it effectively invisible. </p><p>Invisible\ncreatures leave tracks. They can be tracked normally. Footprints in sand, mud,\nor other soft surfaces can give enemies clues to an invisible creature’s\nlocation.</p><p>An\ninvisible creature in the water displaces water, revealing its location. The\ninvisible creature, however, is still hard to see and benefits from\nconcealment.</p><p>A\ncreature with the scent ability can detect an invisible creature as it would a\nvisible one.</p><p>A\ncreature with the Blind-Fight feat has a better chance to hit an invisible\ncreature. Roll the miss chance twice, and he misses only if both rolls indicate\na miss. (Alternatively, make one 25% miss chance roll rather than two 50% miss\nchance rolls.)</p><p>A\ncreature with blindsight can attack (and otherwise interact with) creatures\nregardless of invisibility.</p><p>An\ninvisible burning torch still gives off light, as does an invisible object with\na light spell (or similar spell) cast upon it.</p><p>Ethereal\ncreatures are invisible. Since ethereal creatures are not materially present,\nSpot checks, Listen checks, Scent, Blind-Fight, and blindsight don’t help\nlocate them. Incorporeal creatures are often invisible. Scent, Blind-Fight, and\nblindsight don’t help creatures find or attack invisible, incorporeal\ncreatures, but Spot checks and possibly Listen checks can help.</p><p>Invisible\ncreatures cannot use gaze attacks.</p><p>Invisibility\ndoes not thwart <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">detect </span>spells.</p><p>Since\nsome creatures can detect or even see invisible creatures, it is helpful to be\nable to hide even when invisible.</p></section><section id=\"h3-24-level-loss\"><h3>레벨 손실</h3><p>A\ncharacter who loses a level instantly loses one Hit Die. The character’s base\nattack bonus, base saving throw bonuses, and special class abilities are now\nreduced to the new, lower level. Likewise, the character loses any ability\nscore gain, skill ranks, and any feat associated with the level (if applicable).\nIf the exact ability score or skill ranks increased from a level now lost is\nunknown (or the player has forgotten), lose 1 point from the highest ability\nscore or ranks from the highest-ranked skills. If a familiar or companion\ncreature has abilities tied to a character who has lost a level, the creature’s\nabilities are adjusted to fit the character’s new level.</p><p>The\nvictim’s experience point total is immediately set to the midpoint of the\nprevious level.</p></section><section id=\"h3-25-low-light-vision\"><h3>저광시야</h3><p>Characters\nwith low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they can\nsee twice as far as normal in dim light. Low-light vision is color vision. A\nspellcaster with low-light vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest\ncandle flame is next to her as a source of light.</p><p>Characters\nwith low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can\nduring the day.</p></section><section id=\"h3-26-paralysis\"><h3>마비</h3><p>Some\nmonsters and spells have the supernatural or spell-like ability to paralyze\ntheir victims, immobilizing them through magical means. (Paralysis from toxins\nis discussed in the Poison section below.)</p><p>A\nparalyzed character cannot move, speak, or take any physical action. He is\nrooted to the spot, frozen and helpless. Not even friends can move his limbs.\nHe may take purely mental actions, such as casting a spell with no components.</p><p>A\nwinged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed cannot\nflap its wings and falls. A swimmer can’t swim and may drown.</p></section><section id=\"h3-27-poison\"><h3>독</h3><p>When\na character takes damage from an attack with a poisoned weapon, touches an item\nsmeared with contact poison, consumes poisoned food or drink, or is otherwise\npoisoned, he must make a Fortitude saving throw. If he fails, he takes the\npoison’s initial damage (usually ability damage). Even if he succeeds, he\ntypically faces more damage 1 minute later, which he can also avoid with a\nsuccessful Fortitude saving throw.</p><p>One\ndose of poison smeared on a weapon or some other object affects just a single\ntarget. A poisoned weapon or object retains its venom until the weapon scores a\nhit or the object is touched (unless the poison is wiped off before a target\ncomes in contact with it). Any poison smeared on an object or exposed to the\nelements in any way remains potent until it is touched or used.</p><p>Although\nsupernatural and spell-like poisons are possible, poisonous effects are almost\nalways extraordinary.</p><p>Poisons\ncan be divided into four basic types according to the method by which their\neffect is delivered, as follows.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Contact:</span><span> Merely touching this type\nof poison necessitates a saving throw. It can be actively delivered via a\nweapon or a touch attack. Even if a creature has sufficient damage reduction to\navoid taking any damage from the attack, the poison can still affect it. A\nchest or other object can be smeared with contact poison as part of a trap.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Ingested:</span><span> Ingested poisons are\nvirtually impossible to utilize in a combat situation. A poisoner could\nadminister a potion to an unconscious creature or attempt to dupe someone into\ndrinking or eating something poisoned. Assassins and other characters tend to\nuse ingested poisons outside of combat.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Inhaled:</span><span> Inhaled poisons are\nusually contained in fragile vials or eggshells. They can be thrown as a ranged\nattack with a range increment of 10 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is\nstruck hard), the container releases its poison. One dose spreads to fill the\nvolume of a 10-foot cube. Each creature within the area must make a saving\nthrow. (Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons; they\naffect the nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.)</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Injury:</span><span> This poison must be\ndelivered through a wound. If a creature has sufficient damage reduction to\navoid taking any damage from the attack, the poison does not affect it. Traps\nthat cause damage from weapons, needles, and the like sometimes contain injury\npoisons.</span></p><p>The\ncharacteristics of poisons are summarized on Table: Poisons. Terms on the table\nare defined below.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Type:\n</span><span>The\npoison’s method of delivery (contact, ingested, inhaled, or via an injury) and\nthe Fortitude save DC to avoid the poison’s damage.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Initial\nDamage: </span><span>The\ndamage the character takes immediately upon failing his saving throw against\nthis poison. Ability damage is temporary unless marked with an asterisk (*), in\nwhich case the loss is a permanent drain. Paralysis lasts for 2d6 minutes.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Secondary\nDamage: </span><span>The\namount of damage the character takes 1 minute after exposure as a result of the\npoisoning, if he fails a second saving throw. Unconsciousness lasts for 1d3\nhours. Ability damage marked with an asterisk is permanent drain instead of\ntemporary damage.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Price:\n</span><span>The cost\nof one dose (one vial) of the poison. It is not possible to use or apply poison\nin any quantity smaller than one dose. The purchase and possession of poison is\nalways illegal, and even in big cities it can be obtained only from\nspecialized, less than reputable sources.</span></p><section id=\"h4-28-perils-of-using-poison\"><h4>독 사용의 위험성</h4><p>A\ncharacter has a 5% chance of exposing himself to a poison whenever he applies\nit to a weapon or otherwise readies it for use. Additionally, a character who\nrolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with a poisoned weapon must make a DC 15\nReflex save or accidentally poison himself with the weapon.</p></section><section id=\"h4-29-poison-immunities\"><h4>독 내성</h4><p>Creatures\nwith natural poison attacks are immune to their own poison. Nonliving creatures\n(constructs and undead) and creatures without metabolisms (such as elementals)\nare always immune to poison. Oozes, plants, and certain kinds of outsiders are\nalso immune to poison, although conceivably special poisons could be concocted\nspecifically to harm them.</p><div class=\"table-container\"><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

Polymorphed creatures retain\ntheir own minds but have new physical forms.</p><p>The\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">polymorph </span>spell defines the general polymorph effect.</p><p>Since\ncreatures do not change types, a slaying or bane weapon designed to kill or\nharm creatures of a specific type affects those creatures even if they are\npolymorphed. Likewise, a creature polymorphed into the form of a creature of a\ndifferent type is not subject to slaying and bane effects directed at that type\nof creature. </p><p>A\nranger’s favored enemy bonus is based on knowing what the foe is, so if a\ncreature that is a ranger’s favored enemy polymorphs into another form, the\nranger is denied his bonus.</p><p>A\ndwarf ’s bonus for fighting giants is based on shape and size, so he does not\ngain a bonus against a giant polymorphed into something else, but does gain the\nbonus against any creature polymorphed into a giant.</p></section><section id=\"h3-31-psionics\"><h3>사이오닉</h3><p>Telepathy,\nmental combat and psychic powers—psionics is a catchall word that describes\nspecial mental abilities possessed by various creatures. These are spell-like\nabilities that a creature generates from the power of its mind alone—no other\noutside magical force or ritual is needed. Each psionic creature’s description\ncontains details on its psionic abilities.</p><p>Psionic\nattacks almost always allow Will saving throws to resist them. However, not all\npsionic attacks are mental attacks. Some psionic abilities allow the psionic\ncreature to reshape its own body, heal its wounds, or teleport great distances.\nSome psionic creatures can see into the future, the past, and the present (in\nfar-off locales) as well as read the minds of others. </p></section><section id=\"h3-32-rays\"><h3>광선</h3><p>All\nray attacks require the attacker to make a successful ranged touch attack\nagainst the target. Rays have varying ranges, which are simple maximums. A ray’s\nattack roll never takes a range penalty. Even if a ray hits, it usually allows\nthe target to make a saving throw (Fortitude or Will). Rays never allow a\nReflex saving throw, but if a character’s Dexterity bonus to AC is high, it\nmight be hard to hit her with the ray in the first place.</p></section><section id=\"h3-33-regeneration\"><h3>재생</h3><p>Creatures\nwith this extraordinary ability recover from wounds quickly and can even regrow\nor reattach severed body parts. Damage dealt to the creature is treated as\nnonlethal damage, and the creature automatically cures itself of nonlethal\ndamage at a fixed rate.</p><p>Certain\nattack forms, typically fire and acid, deal damage to the creature normally;\nthat sort of damage doesn’t convert to nonlethal damage and so doesn’t go away.\nThe creature’s description includes the details.</p><p>Creatures\nwith regeneration can regrow lost portions of their bodies and can reattach\nsevered limbs or body parts. Severed parts die if they are not reattached.</p><p>Regeneration\ndoes not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation.</p><p>Attack\nforms that don’t deal hit point damage ignore regeneration.</p><p>An\nattack that can cause instant death only threatens the creature with death if\nit is delivered by weapons that deal it lethal damage.</p></section><section id=\"h3-34-resistance-to-energy\"><h3>마력 저항</h3><p>A\ncreature with resistance to energy has the ability (usually extraordinary) to\nignore some damage of a certain type each round, but it does not have total\nimmunity. </p><p>Each\nresistance ability is defined by what energy type it resists and how many\npoints of damage are resisted. It doesn’t matter whether the damage has a\nmundane or magical source.</p><p>When\nresistance completely negates the damage from an energy attack, the attack does\nnot disrupt a spell. This resistance does not stack with the resistance that a\nspellmight provide.</p></section><section id=\"h3-35-scent\"><h3>냄새</h3><p>This\nextraordinary ability lets a creature detect approaching enemies, sniff out\nhidden foes, and track by sense of smell.</p><p>A\ncreature with the scent ability can detect opponents by sense of smell,\ngenerally within 30 feet. If the opponent is upwind, the range is 60 feet. If\nit is downwind, the range is 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting\ngarbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents,\nsuch as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at three times these\nranges.</p><p>The\ncreature detects another creature’s presence but not its specific location.\nNoting the direction of the scent is a move action. If it moves within 5 feet\nof the scent’s source, the creature can pinpoint that source.</p><p>A\ncreature with the Track feat and the scent ability can follow tracks by smell,\nmaking a Wisdom check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh\ntrail is 10. The DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s\nodor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that\nthe trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the\nrules for the Track feat. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of\nsurface conditions and poor visibility.</p><p>Creatures\nwith the scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar\nsights.</p><p>Water,\nparticularly running water, ruins a trail for air-breathing creatures.\nWater-breathing creatures that have the scent ability, however, can use it in\nthe water easily.</p><p>False,\npowerful odors can easily mask other scents. The presence of such an odor\ncompletely spoils the ability to properly detect or identify creatures, and the\nbase Survival DC to track becomes 20 rather than 10.</p></section><section id=\"h3-36-spell-resistance\"><h3>주문 저항</h3><p>Spell\nresistance is the extraordinary ability to avoid being affected by spells.\n(Some spells also grant spell resistance.)</p><p>To\naffect a creature that has spell resistance, a spellcaster must make a caster\nlevel check (1d20 + caster level) at least equal to the creature’s spell\nresistance. (The defender’s spell resistance is like an Armor Class against\nmagical attacks.) If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn’t affect the\ncreature. The possessor does not have to do anything special to use spell\nresistance. The creature need not even be aware of the threat for its spell\nresistance to operate.</p><p>Only\nspells and spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance. Extraordinary\nand supernatural abilities (including enhancement bonuses on magic weapons) are\nnot. A creature can have some abilities that are subject to spell resistance\nand some that are not. Even some spells ignore spell resistance; see When Spell\nResistance Applies, below. </p><p>A\ncreature can voluntarily lower its spell resistance. Doing so is a standard\naction that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Once a creature lowers\nits resistance, it remains down until the creature’s next turn. At the\nbeginning of the creature’s next turn, the creature’s spell resistance\nautomatically returns unless the creature intentionally keeps it down (also a\nstandard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity).</p><p>A\ncreature’s spell resistance never interferes with its own spells, items, or\nabilities.</p><p>A\ncreature with spell resistance cannot impart this power to others by touching\nthem or standing in their midst. Only the rarest of creatures and a few magic\nitems have the ability to bestow spell resistance upon another.</p><p>Spell\nresistance does not stack. It overlaps. </p><section id=\"h4-37-when-spell-resistance-applies\"><h4>주문 저항이 적용되는 조건</h4><p>Each spell\nincludes an entry that indicates whether spell resistance applies to the spell.\nIn general, whether spell resistance applies depends on what the spell does:</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Targeted\nSpells:</span><span>\nSpell resistance applies if the spell is targeted at the creature. Some\nindividually targeted spells can be directed at several creatures\nsimultaneously. In such cases, a creature’s spell resistance applies only to\nthe portion of the spell actually targeted at that creature. If several\ndifferent resistant creatures are subjected to such a spell, each checks its\nspell resistance separately.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Area\nSpells:</span><span>\nSpell resistance applies if the resistant creature is within the spell’s area.\nIt protects the resistant creature without affecting the spell itself.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Effect\nSpells:</span><span>\nMost effect spells summon or create something and are not subject to spell\nresistance. Sometimes, however, spell resistance applies to effect spells,\nusually to those that act upon a creature more or less directly, such as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">web.</span></span></p><p>Spell\nresistance can protect a creature from a spell that’s already been cast. Check\nspell resistance when the creature is first affected by the spell.</p><p>Check\nspell resistance only once for any particular casting of a spell or use of a\nspell-like ability. If spell resistance fails the first time, it fails each\ntime the creature encounters that same casting of the spell. Likewise, if the\nspell resistance succeeds the first time, it always succeeds. If the creature\nhas voluntarily lowered its spell resistance and is then subjected to a spell,\nthe creature still has a single chance to resist that spell later, when its\nspell resistance is up.</p><p>Spell\nresistance has no effect unless the energy created or released by the spell\nactually goes to work on the resistant creature’s mind or body. If the spell\nacts on anything else and the creature is affected as a consequence, no roll is\nrequired. Creatures can be harmed by a spell without being directly affected. </p><p>Spell\nresistance does not apply if an effect fools the creature’s senses or reveals\nsomething about the creature.</p><p>Magic\nactually has to be working for spell resistance to apply. Spells that have\ninstantaneous durations but lasting results aren’t subject to spell resistance\nunless the resistant creature is exposed to the spell the instant it is cast. </p><p>When\nin doubt about whether a spell’s effect is direct or indirect, consider the\nspell’s school:</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Abjuration:</span><span> The target creature must\nbe harmed, changed, or restricted in some manner for spell resistance to apply.\nPerception changes aren’t subject to spell resistance.</span></p><p>Abjurations\nthat block or negate attacks are not subject to an attacker’s spell\nresistance—it is the protected creature that is affected by the spell (becoming\nimmune or resistant to the attack).</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Conjuration:</span><span> These spells are usually\nnot subject to spell resistance unless the spell conjures some form of energy<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.\n</span>Spells that summon creatures or produce effects that function like\ncreatures are not subject to spell resistance.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Divination:</span><span> These spells do not\naffect creatures directly and are not subject to spell resistance, even though\nwhat they reveal about a creature might be very damaging.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Enchantment:</span><span> Since enchantment spells\naffect creatures’ minds, they are typically subject to spell resistance.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Evocation:</span><span> If an evocation spell\ndeals damage to the creature, it has a direct effect. If the spell damages\nsomething else, it has an indirect effect.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Illusion:\n</span><span>These\nspells are almost never subject to spell resistance. Illusions that entail a\ndirect attack are exceptions.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Necromancy:</span><span> Most of these spells\nalter the target creature’s life force and are subject to spell resistance.\nUnusual necromancy spells that don’t affect other creatures directly are not\nsubject to spell resistance.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Transmutation:</span><span> These spells are subject\nto spell resistance if they transform the target creature. Transmutation spells\nare not subject to spell resistance if they are targeted on a point in space\ninstead of on a creature. Some transmutations make objects harmful (or more\nharmful), such as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">magic stone</span>. Even these spells are not generally\nsubject to spell resistance because they affect the objects, not the creatures\nagainst which the objects are used. Spell resistance works against <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">magic\nstone </span>only if the creature with spell resistance is holding the stones when\nthe cleric casts <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">magic stone </span>on them. </span></p></section><section id=\"h4-38-successful-spell-resistance\"><h4>주문 저항의 성공</h4><p>Spell\nresistance prevents a spell or a spell-like ability from affecting or harming\nthe resistant creature, but it never removes a magical effect from another\ncreature or negates a spell’s effect on another creature.

A dazzled creature takes a –1\npenalty on attack rolls, Search checks, and Spot checks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Dead:\n</span><span>The\ncharacter’s hit points are reduced to –10, his Constitution drops to 0, or he\nis killed outright by a spell or effect. The character’s soul leaves his body.\nDead characters cannot benefit from normal or magical healing, but they can be\nrestored to life via magic. A dead body decays normally unless magically\npreserved, but magic that restores a dead character to life also restores the\nbody either to full health or to its condition at the time of death (depending\non the spell or device). Either way, resurrected characters need not worry\nabout rigor mortis, decomposition, and other conditions that affect dead\nbodies.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Deafened:</span><span> A deafened character\ncannot hear. She takes a –4 penalty on initiative checks, automatically fails\nListen checks, and has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with\nverbal components. Characters who remain deafened for a long time grow\naccustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Disabled:</span><span> A character with 0 hit\npoints, or one who has negative hit points but has become stable and conscious,\nis disabled. A disabled character may take a single move action or standard\naction each round (but not both, nor can she take full-round actions). She\nmoves at half speed. Taking move actions doesn’t risk further injury, but\nperforming any standard action (or any other action the DM deems strenuous,\nincluding some free actions such as casting a quickened spell) deals 1 point of\ndamage after the completion of the act. Unless the action increased the\ndisabled character’s hit points, she is now in negative hit points and dying.</span></p><p>A\ndisabled character with negative hit points recovers hit points naturally if\nshe is being helped. Otherwise, each day she has a 10% chance to start\nrecovering hit points naturally (starting with that day); otherwise, she loses\n1 hit point. Once an unaided character starts recovering hit points naturally,\nshe is no longer in danger of losing hit points (even if her current hit points\nare negative).</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Dying:</span><span> A dying character is\nunconscious and near death. She has –1 to –9 current hit points. A dying\ncharacter can take no actions and is unconscious. At the end of each round\n(starting with the round in which the character dropped below 0 hit points),\nthe character rolls d% to see whether she becomes stable. She has a 10% chance\nto become stable. If she does not, she loses 1 hit point. If a dying character\nreaches –10 hit points, she is dead.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Energy\nDrained:</span><span>\nThe character gains one or more negative levels, which might permanently drain\nthe character’s levels. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as\nHit Dice, he dies. Each negative level gives a creature the following\npenalties: –1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability\nchecks; loss of 5 hit points; and –1 to effective level (for determining the\npower, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities). In\naddition, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from the highest spell\nlevel castable.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Entangled:</span><span> The character is\nensnared. Being entangled impedes movement, but does not entirely prevent it\nunless the bonds are anchored to an immobile object or tethered by an opposing\nforce. An entangled creature moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, and\ntakes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls and a –4 penalty to Dexterity. An\nentangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a Concentration\ncheck (DC 15 + the spell’s level) or lose the spell. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Exhausted:</span><span> An exhausted character\nmoves at half speed and takes a –6 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. After 1\nhour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes fatigued. A fatigued\ncharacter becomes exhausted by doing something else that would normally cause\nfatigue.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Fascinated:\n</span><span>A\nfascinated creature is entranced by a supernatural or spell effect. The\ncreature stands or sits quietly, taking no actions other than to pay attention\nto the fascinating effect, for as long as the effect lasts. It takes a –4\npenalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks. Any\npotential threat, such as a hostile creature approaching, allows the fascinated\ncreature a new saving throw against the fascinating effect. Any obvious threat,\nsuch as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at\nthe fascinated creature, automatically breaks the effect. A fascinated\ncreature’s ally may shake it free of the spell as a standard action. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Fatigued:</span><span> A fatigued character can\nneither run nor charge and takes a –2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. Doing\nanything that would normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued character to\nbecome exhausted. After 8 hours of complete rest, fatigued characters are no\nlonger fatigued. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Flat-Footed:</span><span> A character who has not\nyet acted during a combat is flat-footed, not yet reacting normally to the\nsituation. A flat-footed character loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) and\ncannot make attacks of opportunity. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Frightened:</span><span> A frightened creature\nflees from the source of its fear as best it can. If unable to flee, it may\nfight. A frightened creature takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving\nthrows, skill checks, and ability checks. A frightened creature can use special\nabilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means\nif they are the only way to escape. </span></p><p>Frightened\nis like shaken, except that the creature must flee if possible. Panicked is a\nmore extreme state of fear.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Grappling:</span><span> Engaged in wrestling or\nsome other form of hand-to-hand struggle with one or more attackers. A\ngrappling character can undertake only a limited number of actions. He does not\nthreaten any squares, and loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) against\nopponents he isn’t grappling.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Helpless:</span><span> A helpless character is\nparalyzed, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">held</span>, bound, sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise completely\nat an opponent’s mercy. A helpless target is treated as having a Dexterity of 0\n(–5 modifier). Melee attacks against a helpless target get a +4 bonus\n(equivalent to attacking a prone target). Ranged attacks gets no special bonus\nagainst helpless targets. Rogues can sneak attack helpless targets. </span></p><p>As\na full-round action, an enemy can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace\nto a helpless foe. An enemy can also use a bow or crossbow, provided he is\nadjacent to the target. The attacker automatically hits and scores a critical\nhit. (A rogue also gets her sneak attack damage bonus against a helpless foe\nwhen delivering a coup de grace.) If the defender survives, he must make a\nFortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. </p><p>Delivering\na coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity. </p><p>Creatures\nthat are immune to critical hits do not take critical damage, nor do they need\nto make Fortitude saves to avoid being killed by a coup de grace.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Incorporeal:\n</span><span>Having no\nphysical body. Incorporeal creatures are immune to all nonmagical attack forms.\nThey can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic\nweapons, spells, spell-like effects, or supernatural effects. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Invisible:</span><span> Visually undetectable. An\ninvisible creature gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against sighted opponents,\nand ignores its opponents’ Dexterity bonuses to AC (if any). (See Invisibility,\nunder Special Abilities.)</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Knocked\nDown:</span><span>\nDepending on their size, creatures can be knocked down by winds of high\nvelocity. Creatures on the ground are knocked prone by the force of the wind.\nFlying creatures are instead blown back 1d6 x 10 feet.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Nauseated:</span><span> Experiencing stomach\ndistress. Nauseated creatures are unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on\nspells, or do anything else requiring attention. The only action such a\ncharacter can take is a single move action per turn.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Panicked:\n</span><span>A\npanicked creature must drop anything it holds and flee at top speed from the\nsource of its fear, as well as any other dangers it encounters, along a random\npath. It can’t take any other actions. In addition, the creature takes a –2\npenalty on all saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If cornered, a panicked\ncreature cowers and does not attack, typically using the total defense action\nin combat. A panicked creature can use special abilities, including spells, to\nflee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to\nescape.</span></p><p>Panicked\nis a more extreme state of fear than shaken or frightened.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Paralyzed:</span><span> A paralyzed character is\nfrozen in place and unable to move or act. A paralyzed character has effective\nDexterity and Strength scores of 0 and is helpless, but can take purely mental actions.\nA winged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed\ncannot flap its wings and falls. A paralyzed swimmer can’t swim and may drown.\nA creature can move through a space occupied by a paralyzed creature—ally or\nnot. Each square occupied by a paralyzed creature, however, counts as 2\nsquares.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Petrified:</span><span> A petrified character has\nbeen turned to stone and is considered unconscious. If a petrified character\ncracks or breaks, but the broken pieces are joined with the body as he returns\nto flesh, he is unharmed.

An attacker who is prone has a –4 penalty on melee attack rolls and\ncannot use a ranged weapon (except for a crossbow). A defender who is prone\ngains a +4 bonus to Armor Class against ranged attacks, but takes a –4 penalty\nto AC against melee attacks.</span></p><p>Standing\nup is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Shaken:\n</span><span>A shaken\ncharacter takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and\nability checks.</span></p><p>Shaken\nis a less severe state of fear than frightened or panicked.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Sickened:</span><span> The character takes a –2\npenalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks,\nand ability checks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Stable:</span><span> A character who was dying\nbut who has stopped losing hit points and still has negative hit points is\nstable. The character is no longer dying, but is still unconscious. If the\ncharacter has become stable because of aid from another character (such as a\nHeal check or magical healing), then the character no longer loses hit points.\nHe has a 10% chance each hour of becoming conscious and disabled (even though\nhis hit points are still negative). </span></p><p>If\nthe character became stable on his own and hasn’t had help, he is still at risk\nof losing hit points. Each hour, he has a 10% chance of becoming conscious and\ndisabled. Otherwise he loses 1 hit point.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Staggered:</span><span> A character whose\nnonlethal damage exactly equals his current hit points is staggered. A\nstaggered character may take a single move action or standard action each round\n(but not both, nor can she take full-round actions).</span></p><p>A\ncharacter whose current hit points exceed his nonlethal damage is no longer\nstaggered; a character whose nonlethal damage exceeds his hit points becomes\nunconscious.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Stunned:\n</span><span>A stunned\ncreature drops everything held, can’t take actions, takes a –2 penalty to AC,\nand loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Turned:</span><span> Affected by a turn undead\nattempt.
