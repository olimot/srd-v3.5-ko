Except\nfor rare linking points, each plane is effectively its own universe with its\nown natural laws. </p><p>The 이세계\nbreak down into a number of general types: 물질 세계, the Transitive\n이세계, the Inner 이세계, the Outer 이세계, and the demiplanes.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Material\nPlane: </span><span>물질 세계 tends to be the most Earthlike of all 이세계 and operates under\nthe same set of natural laws that our own real world does. This is the default\nplane for most adventures.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Transitive\n이세계:</span><span>\nThese three 이세계 have one important common characteristic: Each is used to\nget from one place to another. 영적 세계 is a conduit to all other\n이세계, while 에테리얼 세계 and the 어둠의 세계 both serve as means of\ntransportation within 물질 세계 they’re connected to. These 이세계\nhave the strongest regular interaction with 물질 세계 and are often\naccessed by using various 주문. They have native inhabitants as well.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Inner\n이세계:</span><span>\nThese six 이세계 are manifestations of the basic building blocks of the\nuniverse. Each is made up of a single type of energy or element that overwhelms\nall others. The natives of a particular Inner Plane are made of the same energy\nor element as the plane itself.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Outer\n이세계:</span><span>\nThe deities live on the Outer 이세계, as do creatures such as celestials,\n데몬, and 악마. Each of the Outer 이세계 has an 성향, representing a\nparticular moral or ethical outlook, and the natives of each plane tend to behave\nin agreement with that plane’s 성향. The Outer 이세계 are also the final\nresting place of souls from 물질 세계, whether that final rest takes\nthe form of calm introspection or eternal 천벌.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Demiplanes:</span><span> This catch-all category\n엄폐 all extradimensional spaces that function like 이세계 but have\nmeasurable size and limited access. Other kinds of 이세계 are theoretically\ninfinite in size, but a demiplane might be only a few hundred feet across.</span></p></section><section id=\"h3-2-planar-traits\"><h3>이세계 속성</h3><div class=\"original-headline\">PLANAR TRAITS</div><p>Each\nplane of existence has its own properties—the natural laws of its universe.</p><p>이세계 속성 are broken down into a number of general 범위.</p><p>All\n이세계 have the following kinds of traits.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">물리적 속성:</span><span>\nThese traits determine the laws of physics and nature on the plane, including\nhow gravity and time function.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">정령과 에너지 속성:</span><span> These traits determine the dominance of particular 정령\nor energy forces.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">성향적 속성:</span><span>\nJust as characters may be lawful neutral or chaotic good, many 이세계 are tied\nto a particular moral or ethical outlook.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">마법적 속성:</span><span>\nMagic works differently from plane to plane, and 마법적 속성 set the\nboundaries for what it can and can’t do.</span></p></section><section id=\"h3-3-physical-traits\"><h3>물리적 속성</h3><div class=\"original-headline\">Physical\nTraits</div><p>The\ntwo most important natural laws set by 물리적 속성 are how gravity works\nand how time passes. Other 물리적 속성 pertain to the size and shape of a\nplane and how easily a plane’s nature can be altered.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Gravity:</span><span> The direction of\ngravity’s pull may be unusual, and it might even change directions within the\nplane itself.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Normal\nGravity: </span><span>Most\n이세계 have gravity similar to that of 물질 세계. The usual rules for\n능력 점수, 운반 수용량, and encumbrance apply. Unless otherwise\nnoted in a 묘사, it is assumed every plane has the normal gravity trait.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Heavy\nGravity: </span><span>The\ngravity on a plane with this trait is much more intense than on 물질 세계. As a result, 균형, 등반, 도약, 탑승, 수영, and 재주넘기 checks incur a\n–2 circumstance penalty, as do all 명중 굴림. All item weights are\neffectively doubled, which might affect a character’s 속도. Weapon 거리 are\nhalved. A character’s 근력 and 민첩 scores are not affected.\nCharacters who fall on a heavy gravity plane take 1d10 points of 피해 for\neach 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d10 points of 피해.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">빛\nGravity: </span><span>The\ngravity on a plane with this trait is less intense than on 물질 세계.\nAs a result, creatures find that they can lift more, but their 이동 tend\nto be ungainly. Characters on a plane with the 빛 gravity trait take a –2\ncircumstance penalty on 명중 굴림 and 균형, 탑승, 수영, and 재주넘기\nchecks. All items weigh half as much. Weapon 거리 double, and characters gain\na +2 circumstance bonus on 등반 and 도약 checks.</span></p><p>근력\nand 민첩 don’t change as a result of 빛 gravity, but what you can do\nwith such scores does change. These advantages apply to travelers from other\n이세계 as well as natives.</p><p>낙하\ncharacters on a 빛 gravity plane take 1d4 points of 피해 for each 10 feet\nof the fall (maximum 20d4).</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">No\nGravity: </span><span>Individuals\non a plane with this trait merely 부유 in space, unless other resources are\navailable to provide a direction for gravity’s pull.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Objective\nDirectional Gravity: </span><span>The 근력 of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same\nas on 물질 세계, but the direction is not the traditional “down”\ntoward the ground. It may be down toward any solid object, at an angle to the\nsurface of the plane itself, or even upward.</span></p><p>In\naddition, objective directional gravity may change from place to place. The\ndirection of “down” may vary.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Subjective\nDirectional Gravity: </span><span>The 근력 of gravity on a plane with this trait is the\nsame as on 물질 세계, but each individual chooses the direction of\ngravity’s pull. Such a plane has no gravity for unattended objects and\nnonsentient creatures. This sort of 환경 can be very disorienting to the\nnewcomer, but is common on “weightless” 이세계.</span></p><p>Characters\non a plane with subjective directional gravity can 이동 normally along a solid\nsurface by imagining “down” near their feet. If suspended in midair, a\ncharacter “flies” by merely choosing a “down” direction and “낙하” that way.\nUnder such a procedure, an individual “falls” 150 feet in the first round and\n300 feet in each succeeding round. 이동 is straight-line only. In order to\nstop, one has to 감속화 one’s 이동 by changing the designated “down”\ndirection (again, moving 150 feet in the new direction in the first round and\n300 feet per round thereafter).</p><p>It\ntakes a DC 16 지혜 check to set a new direction of gravity as a free action;\nthis check can be made once per round. Any character who fails this 지혜\ncheck in successive rounds receives a +6 bonus on subsequent checks until he or\nshe succeeds.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Time:</span><span> The rate of time’s passage\ncan vary on different 이세계, though it remains constant within any particular\nplane. Time is always subjective for the viewer. The same subjectivity applies\nto various 이세계. Travelers may discover that they’ll pick up or lose time\nwhile moving among the 이세계, but from their point of view, time always passes\nnaturally.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Normal\nTime: </span><span>This\ntrait describes the way time passes on 물질 세계. One hour on a plane\nwith normal time equals one hour on 물질 세계. Unless otherwise noted\nin a 묘사, every plane has the normal time trait.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Timeless:\n</span><span>On 이세계\nwith this trait, time still passes, but the effects of time are diminished. How\nthe timeless trait can affect certain activities or 상태이상 such as hunger,\nthirst, aging, the effects of 독, and 치료 varies from plane to plane.</span></p><p>The\ndanger of a timeless plane is that once one leaves such a plane for one where\ntime flows normally, 상태이상 such as hunger and aging do occur\nretroactively. </p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Flowing\nTime: </span><span>On\nsome 이세계, time can flow faster or slower. One may travel to another plane,\nspend a year there, then return to 물질 세계 to find that only six\nseconds have elapsed. Everything on the plane returned to is only a few seconds\nolder. But for that traveler and the items, 주문, and effects working on him,\nthat year away was entirely real.</span></p><p>When\ndesignating how time works on 이세계 with flowing time, put 물질 세계’s flow of time first, followed by the same flow in the other plane. </p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Erratic\nTime: </span><span>Some\n이세계 have time that 감속화 down and 속도 up, so an individual may lose or\ngain time as he 이동 between the two 이세계.

Most 이세계 are infinite, or at\nleast so large that they may as well be infinite.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Infinite:\n</span><span>이세계\nwith this trait go on forever, though they may have finite 구성요소 within\nthem. Or they may consist of ongoing expanses in two directions, like a map\nthat stretches out infinitely.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Finite\nShape: </span><span>A\nplane with this trait has defined edges or borders. These borders may adjoin\nother 이세계 or hard, finite borders such as the edge of the world or a great\nwall. Demiplanes are often finite.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Self-Contained\nShape: </span><span>On\n이세계 with this trait, the borders wrap in on themselves, depositing the\ntraveler on the other side of the map. A spherical plane is an example of a\nself-contained, finite plane, but there can be cubes, toruses, and flat 이세계\nwith magical edges that 순간이동 the traveler to an opposite edge when he\ncrosses them. </span></p><p>Some\ndemiplanes are self-contained.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Morphic\nTraits:</span><span>\nThis trait measures how easily the basic nature of a plane can be changed. Some\n이세계 are responsive to sentient thought, while others can be manipulated only\nby extremely powerful creatures. And some 이세계 respond to physical or magical\nefforts.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Alterable\nMorphic: </span><span>On\na plane with this trait, objects remain where they are (and what they are)\nunless affected by physical force or magic.

Others change for\nno reason. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Magically\nMorphic: </span><span>Specific\n주문 can alter the basic material of a plane with this trait.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Divinely\nMorphic: </span><span>Specific\nunique beings (deities or similar great powers) have the ability to alter\nobjects, creatures, and the landscape on 이세계 with this trait.

The elements are\nearth, air, fire, and water. The types of energy are positive and negative.</p><p>물질 세계 reflects a balancing of those elements and energies; all are found there.\nEach of the Inner 이세계 is dominated by one element or type of energy. Other\n이세계 may show off various aspects of these 정령 traits. Many 이세계 have\nno 정령 or energy traits; these traits are noted in a plane’s 묘사\nonly when they are present.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Air-Dominant:</span><span> Mostly open space, 이세계\nwith this trait have just a few bits of floating stone or other elements. They\nusually have a breathable atmosphere, though such a plane may include clouds of\nacidic or toxic gas. Creatures of the earth subtype are uncomfortable on\nair-dominant 이세계 because they have little or no natural earth to connect\nwith. They take no actual 피해, however.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Earth-Dominant:</span><span> 이세계 with this trait\nare mostly solid. Travelers who arrive 달리기 the risk of 질식 if they\ndon’t reach a cavern or other pocket within the earth. Worse yet, individuals\nwithout the ability to burrow are entombed in the earth and must dig their way\nout (5 feet per turn). Creatures of the air subtype are uncomfortable on earth\ndominant 이세계 because these 이세계 are tight and claustrophobic to them. But\nthey suffer no inconvenience beyond having difficulty moving.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Fire-Dominant:\n</span><span>이세계\nwith this trait are composed of flames that continually burn without consuming\ntheir fuel source. Fire-dominant 이세계 are extremely hostile to Material Plane\ncreatures, and those without 저항 or immunity to fire are soon immolated.</span></p><p>Unprotected\nwood, paper, cloth, and other flammable materials catch fire almost\nimmediately, and those wearing unprotected flammable 의류 catch on fire. In\naddition, individuals take 3d10 points of fire 피해 every round they are on a\nfire-dominant plane. Creatures of the water subtype are extremely uncomfortable\non fire-dominant 이세계. Those that are made of water take double 피해 each\nround.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Water-Dominant:</span><span> 이세계 with this trait\nare mostly liquid. Visitors who can’t breathe water or reach a pocket of air\nwill likely drown. Creatures of the fire subtype are extremely uncomfortable on\nwater-dominant 이세계. Those made of fire take 1d10 points of 피해 each\nround.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Positive-Dominant:\n</span><span>An\nabundance of life characterizes 이세계 with this trait. The two kinds of\npositive-dominant traits are minor positive-dominant and major\npositive-dominant. A minor positive-dominant plane is a riotous explosion of\nlife in all its forms. Colors are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are\nlouder, and sensations are more intense as a result of the positive energy\nswirling through the plane. All individuals in a positive-dominant plane gain\n빠른 치료 2 as an extraordinary ability.</span></p><p>Major\npositive-dominant 이세계 go even further. A creature on a major\npositive-dominant plane must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being blinded\nfor 10 rounds by the brilliance of the surroundings. Simply being on the plane\ngrants 빠른 치료 5 as an extraordinary ability. In addition, those at full\n히트 포인트 gain 5 additional 임시 히트 포인트 per round. These 임시 히트 포인트 fade 1d20 rounds after the creature leaves the major positive-\ndominant plane. However, a creature must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round\nthat its 임시 히트 포인트 exceed its normal hit point total. Failing the\n내성 굴림 results in the creature exploding in a riot of energy, killing it.</p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Negative-Dominant:</span><span> 이세계 with this trait\nare vast, empty reaches that suck the life out of travelers who cross them.\nThey tend to be lonely, haunted 이세계, drained of color and filled with 바람\nbearing the soft moans of those who died within them. As with positive-dominant\n이세계, negative-dominant 이세계 can be either minor or major. On minor\nnegative-dominant 이세계, living creatures take 1d6 points of 피해 per round.\nAt 0 히트 포인트 or lower, they crumble into ash.</span></p><p>Major\nnegative-dominant 이세계 are even more severe. Each round, those within must\nmake a DC 25 Fortitude save or gain a negative 레벨. A creature whose negative\n레벨 equal its current 레벨 or 히트 다이스 is slain, becoming a 망령. The <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">죽음의 수호물 </span>spell protects a traveler from the 피해 and 정령 흡수 of a\nnegative-dominant plane.</p></section><section id=\"h3-5-alignment-traits\"><h3>성향적 속성</h3><div class=\"original-headline\">Alignment\nTraits</div><p>Some 이세계\nhave a predisposition to a certain 성향. Most of the inhabitants of these\n이세계 also have the plane’s particular 성향, even powerful creatures such\nas deities. In addition, creatures of 성향 contrary to the plane have a\ntougher time dealing with its natives and situations.</p><p>The\n성향 trait of a plane affects social interactions there. Characters who\nfollow other 성향 than most of the inhabitants do may find life more\ndifficult.</p><p>성향적 속성 have multiple 구성요소. First are the moral (good or evil) and ethical\n(lawful or chaotic) 구성요소; a plane can have either a moral component, an\nethical component, or one of each.

Such a plane may be more\nconcerned with the 균형 of the 성향 than with accommodating and\naccepting alternate points of view. In the same fashion as for other strongly\naligned 이세계, strongly neutral-aligned 이세계 apply a –2 circumstance penalty\nto 지능-, 지혜-, or 매력-based checks by any creature that isn’t\nneutral. The penalty is applied twice (once for law/chaos, and once for good/evil),\nso neutral good, neutral evil, lawful neutral, and chaotic neutral creatures\ntake a –2 penalty and lawful good, chaotic good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil\ncreatures take a –4 penalty.</p></section><section id=\"h3-6-magic-traits\"><h3>마법적 속성</h3><div class=\"original-headline\">Magic Traits</div><p>A plane’s magic\ntrait describes how magic works on the plane compared to how it works on 물질 세계.

Class 능력 that use positive energy, such as turning and\ndestroying undead, gain a +10 bonus on the roll to determine 히트 다이스 affected.\n(Undead are almost impossible to find on this plane, however.)</p><p>•\nImpeded magic. 주문 and spell-like 능력 that use negative energy\n(including <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">inflict </span>주문) are impeded.</p><p>Random\nEncounters: Because the 양 에너지 세계 is virtually devoid of creatures,\nrandom encounters on the plane are exceedingly rare.</p></section></section></section>"},"__N_SSG":true}
