      <h1>몬스터 개량하기</h1>
      <div class="original-headline">IMPROVING MONSTERS</div>
      <p>
        Each of the monster entries describes a typical creature of its kind. However, there are several methods by
        which extraordinary or unique 몬스터 can be created using a typical creature as the foundation: by adding
        character classes, increasing a monster의 히트 다이스, or by adding a template to a monster. These methods are
        not mutually exclusive—it의 possible for a monster with a template to be improved by both increasing its 히트
        다이스 and adding character 직업 레벨.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>직업 레벨:</b><span>
          Intelligent creatures that are reasonably humanoid in shape most commonly advance by 직업 레벨 추가하기.
          Creatures that fall into this category have an entry of “By character class” in their 성장 line. When a
          monster adds a 직업 레벨, that 레벨 usually represents an increase in experience and learned 스킬 and
          capabilities.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Increased 히트 다이스:</b><span>
          Intelligent creatures that are not humanoid in shape, and nonintelligent 몬스터, can advance by increasing
          their 히트 다이스. Creatures with increased 히트 다이스 are usually superior specimens of their race, bigger
          and more powerful than their 달리기-of-the-mill fellows.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>템플릿:</b><span>
          Both intelligent and nonintelligent creatures with an unusual heritage or an inflicted change in their
          essential nature may be modified with a template. 템플릿 usually result in tougher 몬스터 with capabilities
          that differ from those of their common kin.</span>
      </p>
      <p>Each of these three methods for 몬스터 개량하기 is discussed in more detail below.</p>
      <section id="h2-1-ability-score-arrays">
        <h2>능력 점수 배열</h2>
        <div class="original-headline">ABILITY SCORE ARRAYS</div>
        <p>
          몬스터 are assumed to have completely average (or standard) 능력 점수—a 10 or an 11 in each ability, as
          modified by their racial 보너스. However, improved 몬스터 are individuals and often have better than normal
          능력 점수, and usually make use of either the elite array or the nonelite array of 능력 점수. 몬스터 who
          improve by adding a template, and 몬스터 who improve by increasing their 히트 다이스, may use any of the three
          arrays (standard, nonelite, or elite). Any monster unique enough to be improved could easily be considered
          elite.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Elite Array: </b><span>The elite array is 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. While the monster has one weakness compared to a typical member
            of its race, it is significantly better overall. The elite array is most appropriate for 몬스터 who add 레벨
            in a player character class.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Nonelite Array:</b><span>
            The nonelite array is 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. The nonelite array does not necessarily make a monster better
            than normal, but it does customize the monster as an individual with 근력 and weaknesses compared to a
            typical member of its race. The nonelite array is most appropriate for 몬스터 who add 직업 레벨 in a NPC
            class.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Ability Score Improvement:</b><span>
            Treat monster 히트 다이스 the same as character 레벨 for determining ability score increases. This only
            applies to 히트 다이스 increases, 몬스터 do not gain ability score increases for 레벨 they “already reached”
            with their racial 히트 다이스, since these adjustments are included in their basic 능력 점수.</span>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="h2-2-monsters-and-class-levels">
        <h2>몬스터와 직업 레벨</h2>
        <div class="original-headline">MONSTERS AND CLASS LEVELS</div>
        <p>
          If a creature acquires a character class, it follows the rules for 멀티직업 캐릭터<i>.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The creature의 히트 다이스 equal the number of 직업 레벨 it has plus its racial 히트 다이스. A creature의
          “monster class” is always a 선호 직업, and the creature never takes XP 페널티 for having it. Additional 히트
          다이스 gained from taking 레벨 in a character class never affect a creature의 size.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Humanoids and 직업 레벨:</b><span>
            Creatures with 1 or less HD replace their monster 레벨 with their character 레벨. The monster loses 공격
            보너스, 내성 굴림 보너스, 스킬, and 특기 granted by its 1 monster HD and gains 공격 보너스, save 보너스,
            스킬, 특기, and other class 능력 of a 1st-레벨 character of the appropriate class.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>레벨 보정 and Effective Character 레벨:</b><span>
            To determine the effective character 레벨(ECL) of a monster character, add its 레벨 보정 to its racial 히트
            다이스 and character 직업 레벨. The monster is considered to have experience points equal to the minimum
            needed to be a character of its ECL.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you choose to equip a monster with gear, use its ECL as its character 레벨 for 목적 of determining how much
          장비 it can purchase. Generally, only 몬스터 with an 성장 entry of “By character class” receive NPC gear;
          other creatures adding character 레벨 should be treated as 몬스터 of the appropriate CR and assigned 전리품,
          not 장비.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Feat Acquisition and Ability Score Increases:</b><span>
            A monster의 total 히트 다이스, not its ECL, govern its acquisition of 특기 and ability score increases.
          </span>

        <h2>히트 다이스 늘리기</h2>
        <div class="original-headline">INCREASING HIT DICE</div>
        <p>
          As its 히트 다이스 increase, a creature의 공격 보너스 and 내성 굴림 수정치 might improve. It gains more 특기
          and 스킬, depending on its type, as shown on 표: Creature Improvement by Type.
        </p>
        <p>Note that if a creature acquires a character class, it improves according to its class, not its type.</p>

        <div class="original-headline">TEMPLATES</div>
        <p>
          Certain creatures are created by adding a template to an existing creature. A templated creature can represent
          a freak of nature, the individual creation of a single experimenter, or the first generation of offspring from
          parents of different species.

          <div class="original-headline">ACQUIRED AND INHERITED TEMPLATES</div>
          <p>
            Some 템플릿 can be added to creatures anytime. 템플릿 such as these are referred to as acquired 템플릿,
            indicating that the creature did not always have the attributes of the template.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other 템플릿, known as inherited 템플릿, are part of a creature from the beginning of its existence.
            Creatures are born with these 템플릿.
          </p>
          <p>It의 possible for a certain kind of template to be of either type.</p>

          <div class="original-headline">READING A TEMPLATE</div>
          <p>
            A template의 묘사 provides a set of instructions for altering an existing creature, known as the base
            creature. The changes that a template might cause to each line of a creature 의 수치 표 are discussed below.
            Generally, if a template does not cause a change to a certain statistic, that entry is missing from the
            template 묘사. For clarity, the entry for a statistic or attribute that is not changed is sometimes given as
            “Same as the base creature.”
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>크기와 유형:</b><span> 템플릿 often change a creature의 type, and may change the creature의 size.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If a template changes the base creature의 type, the creature also acquires the augmented subtype unless the
            template 묘사 indicates otherwise. The augmented subtype is always paired with the creature의 original type.
            Unless a template indicates otherwise, the new creature has the traits of the new type but the features of
            the original type.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a template changes a creature의 size, use 표: Changes to Statistics by Size to calculate changes to
            자연 갑옷, 방어도, 명중 굴림, and 드잡이 보너스.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>히트 다이스 and 히트 포인트:</b><span>
              Most 템플릿 do not change the number of 히트 다이스 a monster has, but some do. Some 템플릿 change the
              size of a creature의 히트 다이스(usually by changing the creature type). A few 템플릿 change previously
              acquired 히트 다이스, and continue to change 히트 다이스 gained with 직업 레벨, but most 템플릿 that
              change 히트 다이스 change only the creature의 original HD and leave class 히트 다이스 unchanged.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If 히트 다이스 entry in a template 묘사 is missing, 히트 다이스 and 히트 포인트 do not change unless the
            creature의 건강 수정치 changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>선제권: </b><span>If a template changes the monster의 민첩, or if it adds or removes 향상된 선제권 feat, this entry
              changes.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>속도:</b><span>
              If a template modifies a creature의 속도, the template states how that happens. More commonly, a template
              adds a new 이동 mode.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>방어도:</b><span>
              If a template changes the creature의 size, see 표: Changes to Statistics by Size to determine its new
              방어도 and to see whether its 자연 갑옷 changes. In some cases the method of determining 방어도 changes
              radically; the template 묘사 explains how to adjust the creature의 AC.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>기본 공격/드잡이:</b><span>
              템플릿 usually do not change a creature의 기본 공격 보너스. If a template modifies a creature의 base 공격
              보너스, the template 묘사 states how that happens. Changes to a creature의 근력 score can change a
              creature의 드잡이 보너스, as can changes to its size.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>공격 and 전력 공격:</b><span>
              Most 템플릿 do not change a creature의 공격 보너스 or modes of 공격, even when the creature의 type changes
              (the creature의 기본 공격 보너스 is the same as a creature of the original type). Of course, any change in
              능력 점수 may affect 공격 보너스. If 근력 or 민첩 changes, use the new 수정치 to determine 공격 보너스. A
              change in a monster의 size also changes its 공격 보너스; see 표: Changes to Statistics by Size.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>피해:</b><span>
              피해 changes with 근력. If the creature uses a two-handed weapon or has a single natural weapon, it adds
              1-1/2 times its 근력 보너스 to 피해. If it has more than a single 공격 then it adds its 근력 보너스 to
              피해 rolls for the primary 공격 and 1/2 its 근력 보너스 to all secondary 공격.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>공간범위/도달범위:</b><span>
              A template may change this entry if it changes the monster의 size. Note that this table does not take into
              account special situations such as exceptional reach.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>특수 공격:</b><span>
              A template may add or remove 특수 공격. The template 묘사 gives the details of any 특수 공격 a template
              provides, including how to determine 내성 굴림 DCs, if applicable.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>특성:</b><span>
              A template may add or remove 특성. The template 묘사 gives the details of any 특성 a template provides,
              including how to determine 내성 굴림 DCs, if applicable. Even if 특성 entry is missing from a template
              묘사, the creature still gains any qualities associated with its new type.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Base 내성 굴림:</b><span>
              As with 공격, changing a monster의 type does not always change its base 내성 굴림 보너스. You only need to
              adjust them for new 수정치 for 건강, 민첩, or 지혜. A template may, however, state that a monster has a
              different “good” 내성 굴림.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>능력:</b><span> If a template changes one or more 능력 점수, these changes are noted here.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>스킬: </b><span>As with 공격, changing a monster의 type does not always change its skill points. Most 템플릿 don’t change
              the number of 히트 다이스 a creature has, so you don’t need to adjust 스킬 in that case unless the key
              능력 for those 스킬 have changed, or the template gives 보너스 on one or more 스킬, or unless the template
              gives a feat that provides 보너스 on a skill check.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Some 템플릿 change how skill points are determined, but this change usually only affects skill points gained
            after the template is applied. Treat 스킬 listed in the base creature의 묘사 as 직업 스킬, as well as any
            new 스킬 provided by the template.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>특기:</b><span>
              Since most 템플릿 do not change the number of 히트 다이스 a creature has, a template will not change the
              number of 특기 the creature has. Some 템플릿 grant one or more 보너스 특기.</span>
          </p>
          <p><b>환경:</b><span> Usually the same as the base creature.</span></p>
          <p><b>집단:</b><span> Usually the same as the base creature.</span></p>
          <p>
            <b>도전 지수:</b><span>
              Most 템플릿 increase the creature의 도전 지수. A template might provide 수정치 to be added to the base
              creature의 CR, or it might specify a 거리 of 수정치 depending on the base creature의 original 히트 다이스
              or CR.</span>
          </p>
          <p><b>전리품: </b><span>Usually the same as the base creature.</span></p>
          <p>
            <b>성향:</b><span> Usually the same as the base creature, unless the template is associated with a certain 성향.</span>
          </p>
          <p><b>성장:</b><span> Usually the same as the base creature.</span></p>
          <p>
            <b>레벨 보정:</b><span>
              This entry is 수정치 to the base creature의 레벨 보정. Any 레벨 보정 is meaningless unless the creature
              retains a high enough 지능(minimum 3) to gain 직업 레벨 after applying the template.</span>

            <div class="original-headline">Adding More Than One Template</div>
            <p>
              In theory, there의 no limit to the number of 템플릿 you can add to a creature. To add more than one
              template, just apply each template one at a time. Always apply inherited 템플릿 before applying acquired
              템플릿. Whenever you add multiple 템플릿, pay attention to the creature의 type—you may add a template that
              makes the creature ineligible for other 템플릿 you might want to add.

          When 직업 레벨 추가하기 to a creature with 1 or less HD, you advance the creature like a character. Otherwise,

            수정치. If you give a creature a PC class use the elite array of 능력 점수 before racial adjustments: 15,
            14, 13, 12, 10, 8. Creatures with NPC 직업 use the nonelite array of 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. T

              바바리안, 전사, 성기사, and 레인저 are associated classes for a creature that relies on its fighting
              ability.

              도적 and 레인저 are associated classes for a creature that relies on stealth to 기습 its foes, or on skill

              A spellcasting class is an associated class for a creature that already has the ability to cast 주문 as a
              character of the class in question, since the monster의 레벨 in the spellcasting class stack with its
              innate spellcasting ability.

              If you add a 직업 레벨 that doesn’t directly play to a creature의 근력 the 직업 레벨 is considered
              nonassociated, and things get a little more complicated<i>. </i>Adding a
              nonassociated 직업 레벨 to a monster increases its CR by 1/2 per 레벨 until one of its 비연관 직업 레벨
              equals its original 히트 다이스. At that point, each additional 레벨 of the same class or a similar one is
              considered associated and increases the monster의 CR by 1.
            </p>
            <p>레벨 in NPC 직업 are always treated as nonassociated.</p>

            When you improve a monster by 히트 다이스 추가하기, use 표: Improved Monster CR Increase to determine the
            effect on the creature의 CR. Keep in mind that many 몬스터 that advance by 히트 다이스 추가하기 also
            increase in size. Do not stack this CR increase with any increase from 직업 레벨. In general, once you’ve
            doubled a creature의 CR, you should closely watch any additional increases in its 능력. 히트 다이스 추가하기
            to a creature improves several of its 능력, and radical increases might not follow this progression
            indefinitely. Compare the monster의 improved 공격 보너스, 내성 굴림 보너스, and any DCs of its 특수 능력
            from the HD increase to typical characters of the appropriate 레벨 and adjust the CR accordingly.

            Generally, increasing a monster의 크기 늘리기 its 전투 effectiveness. Large creatures gain increased 근력,

          <p>
            Be careful, though. 몬스터 that benefit from a smaller size may actually lose effectiveness because of a
            size increase. 몬스터 that don’t benefit from 크기 늘리기 don’t advance in that manner for this reason.

          <p>
            You can add any sort of 유사주문, supernatural, or extraordinary ability to a creature. As with a class
            레벨, you should determine how much, or how little, this ability adds to the creature의 existing repertoire.
            A suite of 능력 that work together should be treated as a single 수정치 for this 목적. If the ability (or
            combination of 능력) significantly increases the monster의 전투 effectiveness, increase its CR by 2. Minor
            능력 increase the creature의 CR by 1, and truly trivial 능력 may not increase CR at all. If 특수 능력 a
            monster gains are not tied to a class or Hit Die increase, this CR increase stacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            A significant special 공격 is one that stands a good chance of incapacitating or crippling a character in
            one round. A significant special quality is one that seriously diminishes the monster의 vulnerability to
            common 공격. Do not add this factor twice if a monster has both 특수 능력과 특성.
          </p>
          <p>Make sure to “scale” your evaluation of these 능력 by the monster의 current CR.</p>
