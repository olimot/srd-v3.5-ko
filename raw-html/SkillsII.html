        <p>
          <i>First 보조: </i><span>You usually use first 보조 to save a 죽어가고 있음 character. If a character has negative 히트 포인트 and
            is losing 히트 포인트(at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him or her stable.
            A stable character regains no 히트 포인트 but stops losing them.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Long-Term Care: </i><span>Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your 치료 check is
            successful, the patient recovers 히트 포인트 or ability score points (lost to ability 피해) at twice the
            normal rate: 2 히트 포인트 per 레벨 for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 히트 포인트 per 레벨 for each
            full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score
            points for each full day of complete rest.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can tend as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so
          on) that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as 빛 activity for the healer. You
          cannot give long-term care to yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Treat Wound from Caltrop, 가시 성장, or 가시 암석: </i><span>A creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop 이동 at one-half normal 속도. A successful 치료 check removes
            this 이동 페널티.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          A creature wounded by a <i>가시 성장 </i>or
          <i>가시 암석 </i>spell must succeed on a Reflex save or take injuries that
          reduce his 속도 by one-third. Another character can remove this 페널티 by taking 10 minutes to dress the
          victim의 injuries and succeeding on a 치료 check against the spell의 save DC.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Treat 독: </i><span>To treat 독 means to tend a single character who has been poisoned and who is going to take more 피해 from
            독(or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a 내성 굴림 against 독, you make a
            치료 check. The poisoned character uses your check result or his or her 내성 굴림, whichever is
            higher.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Treat 질병: </i><span>To treat a 질병 means to tend a single diseased character. Every time he or she makes a 내성 굴림 against
            질병 effects, you make a 치료 check. The diseased character uses your check result or his or her 내성 굴림,
            whichever is higher.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Action:</b><span>
            Providing first 보조, treating a wound, or treating 독 is a standard action. Treating a 질병 or tending a
            creature wounded by a <i>가시 성장 </i>or
            <i>가시 암석 </i>spell takes 10 minutes of work. Providing long-term care
            requires 8 hours of 빛 activity.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Try Again:</b><span>
            Varies. Generally speaking, you can’t try a 치료 check again without proof of the original check의 failure.
            You can always retry a check to provide first 보조, assuming the target of the previous attempt is still
            alive.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>특수:</b><span> A character with 자급자족 feat gets a +2 보너스 on 치료 checks.</span>

        <h3>숨기(Dex; 갑옷 판정 패널티)</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">HIDE (DEX; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</div>
        <p>
          <b>Check:</b><span>
            Your 숨기 check is opposed by 감지 check of anyone who might see you. You can 이동 up to one-half your
            normal 속도 and 숨기 at no 페널티. When moving at a 속도 상급 than one-half but less than your normal 속도,
            you take a –5 페널티. It의 practically impossible (–20 페널티) to 숨기 while attacking, running or
            charging.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size 보너스 or 페널티 on 숨기 checks depending on its size
          category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large –4, Huge –8, Gargantuan –12, Colossal –16.
        </p>
        <p>
          You need 엄폐 or 은폐 in order to attempt a 숨기 check. Total 엄폐 or total 은폐 usually (but not always; see
          Special, below) obviates the need for a 숨기 check, since nothing can see you anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          If people are observing you, even casually, you can’t 숨기. You can 달리기 around a corner or behind 엄폐 so
          that you’re out of sight and then 숨기, but the others then know at least where you went.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a 허세 check; see below), though, you can attempt to
          숨기. While the others turn their attention from you, you can attempt a 숨기 check if you can get to a hiding
          place of some kind. (As a general guideline, the hiding place has to be within 1 foot per rank you have in
          숨기.) This check, however, is made at a –10 페널티 because you have to 이동 fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Sniping: </i><span>If you’ve already successfully hidden at least 10 feet from your target, you can make one ranged 공격, then
            immediately 숨기 again. You take a –20 페널티 on your 숨기 check to conceal yourself after the shot.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Creating a Diversion to 숨기: </i><span>You can use 허세 to help you 숨기. A successful 허세 check can give you the momentary diversion you need to
            attempt a 숨기 check while people are aware of you.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Action:</b><span>
            Usually none. Normally, you make a 숨기 check as part of 이동, so it doesn’t take a separate action.
            However, hiding immediately after a ranged 공격(see Sniping, above) is a 이동 action.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>특수:</b><span>
            If you are invisible, you gain a +40 보너스 on 숨기 checks if you are immobile, or a +20 보너스 on 숨기
            checks if you’re moving.</span>
        </p>
        <p>If you have 은신 feat, you get a +2 보너스 on 숨기 checks.</p>
        <p>
          A 13th-레벨 레인저 can attempt a 숨기 check in any sort of natural terrain, even if it doesn’t grant 엄폐 or
          은폐. A 17thlevel 레인저 can do this even while being observed.

        <h3>위협(Cha)</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">INTIMIDATE (CHA)</div>
        <p>
          <b>Check:</b><span>
            You can change another의 behavior with a successful check. Your 위협 check is opposed by the target의
            modified 레벨 check (1d20 + character 레벨 or 히트 다이스 + target의 지혜 보너스 [if any] + target의 수정치
            on 내성 굴림 against 공포). If you beat your target의 check result, you may treat the target as friendly,
            but only for 목적 of actions taken while it remains intimidated. (That is, the target retains its normal
            attitude, but will chat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while intimidated. See 외교
            skill, above, for additional details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains in your presence, and
            for 1d6×10 minutes afterward. After this time, the target의 default attitude toward you shifts to unfriendly
            (or, if normally unfriendly, to hostile).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target provides you with incorrect or useless information, or
          otherwise frustrates your efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>사기저하 Opponent: </i><span>You can also use 위협 to weaken an opponent의 resolve in 전투. To do so, make an 위협 check opposed by the
            target의 modified 레벨 check (see above). If you win, the target becomes shaken for 1 round. A shaken
            character takes a –2 페널티 on 명중 굴림, 능력 판정, and 내성 굴림. You can 위협 only an opponent that you
            threaten in melee 전투 and that can see you.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Action:</b><span>
            Varies. Changing another의 behavior requires 1 minute of interaction. Intimidating an opponent in 전투 I a
            standard action.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Try Again:</b><span>
            Optional, but not recommended because retries usually do not work. Even if the initial check succeeds, the
            other character can be intimidated only so far, and a retry doesn’t help. If the initial check fails, the
            other character has probably become more firmly resolved to resist the intimidator, and a retry is
            futile.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>특수:</b><span>
            You gain a +4 보너스 on your 위협 check for every size category that you are larger than your target.
            Conversely, you take a –4 페널티 on your 위협 check for every size category that you are smaller than your
            target.</span>
        </p>
        <p>A character immune to 공포 can’t be intimidated, nor can nonintelligent creatures.</p>
        <p>If you have 설득력 feat, you get a +2 보너스 on 위협 checks.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Synergy:</b><span> If you have 5 or more ranks in 허세, you get a +2 보너스 on 위협 checks.</span>

        <h3>도약(Str; 갑옷 판정 패널티)</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">JUMP (STR; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</div>
        <p>
          <b>Check:</b><span>
            The DC and the distance you can 엄폐 vary according to the type of 도약 you are attempting (see
            below).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Your 도약 check is modified by your 속도. If your 속도 is 30 feet then no 수정치 based on 속도 applies to the
          check. If your 속도 is less than 30 feet, you take a –6 페널티 for every 10 feet of 속도 less than 30 feet. If
          your 속도 is 상급 than 30 feet, you gain a +4 보너스 for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          All 도약 DCs given here assume that you get a running start, which requires that you 이동 at least 20 feet in
          a straight line before attempting 도약. If you do not get a running start, the DC for 도약 is doubled.
        </p>
        <p>Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal maximum 이동 in a round.</p>
        <p>
          If you have ranks in 도약 and you succeed on a 도약 check, you land on your feet (when appropriate). If you
          attempt a 도약 check untrained, you land prone unless you beat the DC by 5 or more.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Long 도약: </i><span>A long 도약 is a horizontal 도약, made across a gap like a chasm or stream. At the midpoint of 도약, you
            attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal distance. The DC for 도약 is equal to the
            distance jumped (in feet).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          If your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end. If you fail the check by less than 5, you don’t
          clear the distance, but you can make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the far edge of the gap. You end your 이동
          grasping the far edge. If that leaves you dangling over a chasm or gap, getting up requires a 이동 action and
          a DC 15 등반 check.

            check. Doing so counts as 10 feet of 이동, so if your 속도 is 30 feet, you could 이동 20 feet, then hop up
            onto a counter. You do not need to get a running start to hop up, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get

        <h3>지식(Int; 훈련 필수)</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">KNOWLEDGE (INT; TRAINED ONLY)</div>
        <p>
          Like 제작 and 전문직 스킬, 지식 actually encompasses a number of unrelated 스킬. 지식 represents a study of
          some body of lore, possibly an academic or even scientific 분야.
        </p>
        <p>Below are listed typical fields of study.</p>
        <p>
          • Arcana (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane symbols, cryptic phrases, constructs, 드래곤, magical
          beasts)
        </p>
        <p>• Architecture and engineering (buildings, aqueducts, bridges, fortifications)</p>
        <p>• Dungeoneering (aberrations, caverns, 늪괴물, spelunking)</p>
        <p>• Geography (lands, terrain, climate, people)</p>
        <p>• History (royalty, wars, colonies, migrations, founding of cities)</p>
        <p>• Local (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs, traditions, humanoids)</p>
        <p>• Nature (animals, fey, 거인, monstrous humanoids, plants, seasons and cycles, 날씨, vermin)</p>
        <p>• Nobility and royalty (lineages, heraldry, family trees, mottoes, personalities)</p>
        <p>• Religion (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic tradition, holy symbols, undead)</p>
        <p>
          • 이세계(the Inner 이세계, the Outer 이세계, 영적 세계, 에테리얼 세계, outsiders, 정령, magic related to
          이세계)
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Check:</b><span>
            Answering a question within your field of study has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic
            questions), or 20 to 30 (for really tough questions).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          In many cases, you can use this skill to 식별 몬스터 and their special powers or vulnerabilities. In general,
          the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster의 HD. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful
          information about that monster.
        </p>
        <p>
          For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another piece of useful information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Action:</b><span>
            Usually none. In most cases, making a 지식 check doesn’t take an action—you simply know the answer or you
            don’t.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Try Again:</b><span>
            No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about a topic a second time doesn’t let you know
            something that you never learned in the first place.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Synergy:</b><span> If you have 5 or more ranks in 지식(arcana), you get a +2 보너스 on 주문학 checks.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have 5 or more ranks in 지식(architecture and engineering), you get a +2 보너스 on 탐색 checks made to
          find secret 문 or hidden compartments.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have 5 or more ranks in 지식(geography), you get a +2 보너스 on 생존 checks made to keep from 길잃음 or
          to avoid natural hazards.
        </p>
        <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in 지식(history), you get a +2 보너스 on bardic 지식 checks.</p>
        <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in 지식(local), you get a +2 보너스 on 정보 수집 checks.</p>
        <p>
          If you have 5 or more ranks in 지식(nature), you get a +2 보너스 on 생존 checks made in aboveground natural
          환경(aquatic, desert, forest, hill, marsh, mountains, or plains).
        </p>
        <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in 지식(nobility and royalty), you get a +2 보너스 on 외교 checks.</p>
        <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in 지식(religion), you get a +2 보너스 on turning checks against undead.</p>
        <p>
          If you have 5 or more ranks in 지식(이세계), you get a +2 보너스 on 생존 checks made while on other 이세계.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have 5 or more ranks in 지식(dungeoneering), you get a +2 보너스 on 생존 checks made while underground.
        </p>
        <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in 생존, you get a +2 보너스 on 지식(nature) checks.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Untrained:</b><span>
            An untrained 지식 check is simply an 지능 check. Without actual training, you know only common 지식(DC 10 or
            lower).</span>

          <b>Action:</b><span>
            Varies. Trying to earn money by playing in public requires anywhere from an evening의 work to a full day의

        <p>
          <b>Try Again:</b><span>
            Yes. Retries are allowed, but they don’t negate previous failures, and an audience that has been unimpressed
            in the past is likely to be prejudiced against future performances. (Increase the DC by 2 for each previous

            countersong or his <i>fascinate </i>ability. A 음유시인 needs 6 ranks in a

          <b>Try Again:</b><span>
            Varies. An attempt to use a 전문직 skill to earn an income cannot be retried. You are stuck with whatever
            weekly wage your check result brought you. Another check may be made after a week to determine a new income
            for the next period of time. An attempt to accomplish some specific task can usually be retried.</span>

          <i>Guide with Knees: </i><span>You can react instantly to guide your 탈것 소환 with your knees so that you can use both hands in 전투.
            Make your 탑승 check at the start of your turn. If you fail, you can use only one hand this round because
            you need to use the other to control your 탈것 소환.</span>
        </p>

            수정치, whichever is lower, to see how far the creature can 도약. If you fail your 탑승 check, you fall off
            탈것 소환 when it leaps and take the appropriate 낙하 피해(at least 1d6 points). This usage does not take an

          <i>Spur 탈것 소환: </i><span>You can spur your 탈것 소환 to 상급 속도 with a 이동 action. A successful 탑승 check increases 탈것 소환의
            속도 by 10 feet for 1 round but deals 1 point of 피해 to the creature. You can use this ability every round,
            but each consecutive round of additional 속도 deals twice as much 피해 to 탈것 소환 as the previous round (2
            points, 4 points, 8 points, and so on).</span>
        </p>
        <p>

            전투 riding while in battle. If you fail 탑승 check, you can do nothing else in that round. You do not need

        </p>

            as a free action, provided that you still have a 이동 action available that round. If you fail 탑승 check,
            mounting or dismounting is a 이동 action. You can’t use fast 탈것 소환 or dismount on a 탈것 소환 more than
            one size category larger than yourself.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Action:</b><span>

        <h3>날렵한 손재주(Dex; 훈련 필수; 갑옷 판정 패널티)</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">SLEIGHT OF HAND (DEX; TRAINED ONLY; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</div>
        <p>
          <b>Check:</b><span>
            A DC 10 날렵한 손재주 check lets you palm a coin-sized, unattended object. Performing a minor feat of
            legerdemain, such as making a coin disappear, also has a DC of 10 unless an observer is determined to note
            where the item went.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          When you use this skill under close observation, your skill check is opposed by the observer의 감지 check. The
          observer의 success doesn’t prevent you from performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can 숨기 a small object (including a 경량 무기 or an easily concealed ranged weapon, such as a dart,
          무릿매, or hand crossbow) on your body. Your 날렵한 손재주 check is opposed by 감지 check of anyone observing
          you or 탐색 check of anyone frisking you. In the latter case, the searcher gains a +4 보너스 on 탐색 check,
          since it의 generally easier to find such an object than to 숨기 it. A dagger is easier to 숨기 than most 빛
          무기, and grants you a +2 보너스 on your 날렵한 손재주 check to conceal it. An extraordinarily small object,
          such as a coin, shuriken, or ring, grants you a +4 보너스 on your 날렵한 손재주 check to conceal it, and heavy
          or baggy 의류(such as a cloak) grants you a +2 보너스 on the check.
        </p>
        <p>Drawing a hidden weapon is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an 공격 of opportunity.</p>
        <p>
          If you try to take something from another creature, you must make a DC 20 날렵한 손재주 check to obtain it.
          The opponent makes a 감지 check to detect the attempt, opposed by the same 날렵한 손재주 check result you
          achieved when you tried to grab the item. An opponent who succeeds on this check notices the attempt,
          regardless of whether you got the item.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also use 날렵한 손재주 to entertain an audience as though you were using 공연 skill. In such a case,
          your “act” encompasses elements of legerdemain, juggling, and the like.

            Any 날렵한 손재주 check normally is a standard action. However, you may 공연 a 날렵한 손재주 check as a free
            action by taking a –20 페널티 on the check.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Try Again:</b><span>
            Yes, but after an initial failure, a second 날렵한 손재주 attempt against the same target (or while you are
            being watched by the same observer who noticed your previous attempt) increases the DC for the task by
            10.</span>

          <b>Untrained:</b><span>
            An untrained 날렵한 손재주 check is simply a 민첩 check. Without actual training, you can’t succeed on any
            날렵한 손재주 check with a DC higher than 10, except for hiding an object on your body.</span>

        <div class="original-headline">SPOT (WIS)</div>
        <p>
          <b>Check:</b><span>
            감지 skill is used primarily to detect characters or creatures who are hiding. Typically, your 감지 check is
            opposed by 숨기 check of the creature trying not to be seen. Sometimes a creature isn’t intentionally hiding
            but is still difficult to see, so a successful 감지 check is necessary to notice it.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          A 감지 check result higher than 20 generally lets you become aware of an invisible creature near you, though
          you can’t actually see it.
        </p>
        <p>
          감지 is also used to detect someone in 변장(see 변장 skill), and to read lips when you can’t hear or
          understand what someone is saying.
        </p>
        <p>
          감지 checks may be called for to determine the distance at which an encounter begins. 페널티 applies on such
          checks, depending on the distance between the two individuals or groups, and an additional 페널티 may apply if
          the character making 감지 check is distracted (not concentrating on being observant).

            see him or her 말하기, and understand the speaker의 language. (This use of the skill is language-dependent.)
            The base DC is 15, but it increases for complex speech or an inarticulate speaker. You must maintain a line
            of sight to the lips being read.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          If your 감지 check succeeds, you can understand the general content of a minute의 worth of speaking, but you
          usually still miss certain details. If the check fails by 4 or less, you can’t read the speaker의 lips. If the
          check fails by 5 or more, you draw some incorrect conclusion about the speech. The check is rolled secretly in
          this case, so that you don’t know whether you succeeded or missed by 5.

          <b>Action: </b><span>Varies. Every time you have a chance to 감지 something in a reactive manner you can make a 감지 check

            lips, you must concentrate for a full minute before making a 감지 check, and you can’t 공연 any other action
            (other than moving at up to half 속도) during this minute.</span>

        <p>
          <b>Check:</b><span>
            You can use this skill to read a spell or to activate a magic item. 마법 장치 사용 lets you use a magic item

          <i>Activate Blindly: </i><span>Some 마법 아이템 are activated by special words, thoughts, or actions. You can activate such an item as if
            you were using the activation word, thought, or action, even when you’re not and even if you don’t know it.
            You do have to 공연 some equivalent activity in order to make the check. That is, you must 말하기, wave the
            item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a special +2 보너스 on your 마법 장치 사용
            check if you’ve activated the item in question at least once before. If you fail by 9 or less, you can’t
            activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets
            released but it doesn’t do what you wanted it to do. The default mishaps are that the item affects the wrong
            target or that uncontrolled magical energy is released, dealing 2d6 points of 피해 to you. This mishap is in
            addition to the chance for a mishap that you normally 달리기 when you 주문 시전 from a scroll that you could
            not otherwise cast yourself.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Decipher a Written Spell: </i><span>This usage works just like deciphering a written spell with 주문학 skill, except that the DC is 5 points
            higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of 집중.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Emulate an Ability Score: </i><span>To 주문 시전 from a scroll, you need a high score in the appropriate ability (지능 for 마법사 주문, 지혜
            for 신성 주문, or 매력 for 소서러 or 음유시인 주문). Your effective ability score (appropriate to the class
            you’re emulating when you try to cast the spell from the scroll) is your 마법 장치 사용 check result minus
            15. If you already have a high enough score in the appropriate ability, you don’t need to make this
            check.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Emulate an 성향: </i><span>Some 마법 아이템 have positive or negative effects based on the user의 성향. 마법 장치 사용 lets you use
            these items as if you were of an 성향 of your choice. You can emulate only one 성향 at a time.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Emulate a Class Feature: </i><span>Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a magic item. In this case, your effective 레벨 in
            the emulated class equals your 마법 장치 사용 check result minus 20.&nbsp; This skill does not let you
            actually use the class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had that class
            feature. If the class whose feature you are emulating has an 성향 requirement, you must meet it, either
            honestly or by emulating an appropriate 성향 with a separate 마법 장치 사용 check (see above).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Emulate a Race: </i><span>Some 마법 아이템 work only for members of certain 종족, or work better for members of those 종족. You can
            use such an item as if you were a race of your choice. You can emulate only one race at a time.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Use a Scroll: </i><span>If you are casting a spell from a scroll, you have to decipher it first. Normally, to 주문 시전 from a
            scroll, you must have the scroll의 spell on your class spell list. 마법 장치 사용 allows you to use a scroll
            as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + 시전자 레벨 of the spell
            you are trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a spell from a scroll requires a minimum score
            (10 + spell 레벨) in the appropriate ability. If you don’t have a sufficient score in that ability, you must
            emulate the ability score with a separate 마법 장치 사용 check (see above).</span>
        </p>
        <p>This use of the skill also applies to other spell completion 마법 아이템.</p>
        <p>
          <i>Use a Wand: </i><span>Normally, to use a wand, you must have the wand의 spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill
            allows you to use a wand as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill
            also applies to other spell 트리거 마법 아이템, such as 마법지팡이.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Action:</b><span>
            None. 마법 장치 사용 check is made as part of the action (if any) required to activate the magic item.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Try Again:</b><span>
            Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to activate an item and you fail, then you can’t try
            to activate that item again for 24 hours.</span>
        </p>
        <p><b>특수:</b><span> You cannot take 10 with this skill.</span></p>
        <p>You can’t 보조하기 on 마법 장치 사용 checks. Only the user of the item may attempt such a check.</p>
        <p>If you have 마법 재능 feat, you get a +2 보너스 on 마법 장치 사용 checks.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Synergy:</b><span>

          <i>Secure a Grappling Hook: </i><span>Securing a grappling hook requires a 밧줄 사용 check (DC 10, +2 for every 10 feet of distance the grappling
            hook is thrown, to a maximum DC of 20 at 50 feet). Failure by 4 or less indicates that the hook fails to
            catch and falls, allowing you to try again. Failure by 5 or more indicates that the grappling hook initially
            holds, but comes loose after 1d4 rounds of supporting weight. This check is made secretly, so that you don’t
            know whether the rope will hold your weight.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Bind a Character: </i><span>When you bind another character with a rope, any 탈출 전문가 check that the bound character makes is
            opposed by your 밧줄 사용 check.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          You get a +10 보너스 on this check because it is easier to bind someone than to escape from bonds. You don’t
          even make your 밧줄 사용 check until someone tries to escape.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Action:</b><span>
            Varies. Throwing a grappling hook is a standard action that provokes an 공격 of opportunity. Tying a knot,
            tying a special knot, or tying a rope around yourself one-handed is a full-round action that provokes an
            공격 of opportunity. Splicing two ropes together takes 5 minutes. 결속 a character takes 1 minute.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>특수:</b><span>
            A silk rope gives you a +2 circumstance 보너스 on 밧줄 사용 checks. If you cast an
            <i>살아 움직이는 밧줄 </i>spell on a rope, you get a +2 circumstance 보너스
            on any 밧줄 사용 checks you make when using that rope.</span>
        </p>
        <p>These 보너스 stack.</p>
        <p>If you have 능숙한 손놀림 feat, you get a +2 보너스 on 밧줄 사용 checks.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Synergy:</b><span>
            If you have 5 or more ranks in 밧줄 사용, you get a +2 보너스 on 등반 checks made to 등반 a rope, a knotted
            rope, or a rope-and-wall combination.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have 5 or more ranks in 밧줄 사용, you get a +2 보너스 on 탈출 전문가 checks when escaping from rope
          bonds.
        </p>
        <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in 탈출 전문가, you get a +2 보너스 on checks made to bind someone.</p>
