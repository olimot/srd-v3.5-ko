          An invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the subject of a
          <i>마법사의 갑옷 </i>spell, providing a +4 갑옷 보너스 to AC.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike mundane 갑옷, <i>마법사의 갑옷 </i>entails no 갑옷 판정 페널티,
          비전 주문 실패 chance, or 속도 reduction. Since <i>마법사의 갑옷 </i>is
          made of force, incorporeal creatures can’t 바이패스 it the way they do normal 갑옷.

          All magical effects and 마법 아이템 within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch,

          must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item. An item in a creature의 possession uses its

          Even 유물 are subject to <i>disjunction, </i>though there is only a 1% chance
          per 시전자 레벨 of actually affecting such powerful items. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, you must
          make a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose all spellcasting 능력. (These 능력 cannot be recovered by mortal
          magic, not even <i>기적 </i>or <i>소원</i>.)

        <p>
          You conjure up a phantom watchdog that is invisible to everyone but yourself. It then guards 범위 where it was
          conjured (it does not 이동). The hound immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature
          approaches within 30 feet of it. (Those within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may 이동 about in the
          범위, but if they leave and return, they activate the barking.) The hound sees invisible and ethereal
          creatures. It does not react to figments, but it does react to 어둠 환영술.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, 개 stops barking and delivers a vicious bite (+10
          공격 보너스, 2d6+3 points of piercing 피해) once per round. 개 also gets 보너스 appropriate to an invisible
          creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          개 is considered 준비 to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder의 turn. Its bite is the
          equivalent of a 마법 무기 for 목적 of 피해 축소. The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled.
        </p>
        <p>
          The spell lasts for 1 hour per 시전자 레벨, but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per
          시전자 레벨. If you are ever more than 100 feet distant from the hound, the spell ends.

          You conjure up an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was
          cast. The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only those
          you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You
          may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a
          magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.

        <p>
          You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell의 effect. The place is furnished and
          contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per 시전자 레벨. A staff of
          near-transparent servants (as many as two per 시전자 레벨), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter.
          The servants function as <i>보이지 않는 하인 </i>주문 except that they are

          This spell brings into being a shimmering, swordlike plane of force. The sword strikes at any opponent within
          its 거리, as you desire, starting in the round that you cast the spell. The sword 공격 its designated target
          once each round on your turn. Its 공격 보너스 is equal to your 시전자 레벨 + your Int 보너스 or your Ch보너스
          (for 마법사 or 소서러, respectively) with an additional +3 enhancement 보너스. As a force effect, it can
          strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures. It deals 4d6+3 points of force 피해, with a threat 거리 of 19–20
          and a critical multiplier of x2.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sword always strikes from your direction. It does not get 보너스 for 협공 or help a combatant get one. If

          the sword returns to you and 호버링.

          inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the
          <i>하급 이세계 결속, 이세계 결속, </i>and
          <i>상급 이세계 결속 </i>주문) for a maximum of 24 hours per 시전자 레벨,
          provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the
          <i>magic circle</i>. The creature cannot cross the circle의 boundaries. If a
          creature too large to fit into the spell의 범위 is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal
          <i>악 방어 마법 </i>spell for that creature only.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <i>magic circle </i>leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of
          powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped
          creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the
          called creature has 주문 저항, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its 주문 저항, the
          creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (<i>유체 이탈, 깜빡임, 차원의 문, 에테리얼화, 관문, 이세계 전이, 어둠 보행, 순간이동, </i>and similar 능력) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature의
          extradimensional escape by casting a <i>차원의 닻 </i>spell on it, but you
          must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the
          <i>anchor </i>effect lasts as long as the
          <i>magic circle </i>does. The creature cannot reach across the
          <i>magic circle, </i>but its ranged 공격(원거리 무기, 주문, magical 능력, and
          the like) can. The creature can 공격 any target it can reach with its ranged 공격 except for the circle
          itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference,
          augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <i>magic circle </i>more
          secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 주문학 check. You do not know the
          result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram
          if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If
          time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.
        </p>
        <p>
          A successful diagram allows you to cast a <i>차원의 닻 </i>spell on the
          <i>magic circle </i>during the round before casting any summoning spell. The
          <i>anchor </i>holds any called creatures in the
          <i>magic circle </i>for 24 hours per 시전자 레벨. A creature cannot use its
          주문 저항 against a <i>magic circle </i>prepared with a diagram, and none of
          its 능력 or 공격 can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a 매력 check to break free of the trap (see the
          <i>하급 이세계 결속 </i>spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is
          immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram—even a straw laid across it. However, the creature
          itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.

        <p>
          By casting <i>마법 단지, </i>you place your soul in a gem or large crystal
          (known as the <i>마법 단지</i>), leaving your body lifeless. Then you can
          attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the
          <i>마법 단지. </i>You may 이동 back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped
          soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own
          body, leaving the receptacle empty.
        </p>
        <p>
          To cast the spell, the <i>마법 단지 </i>must be within spell 거리 and you
          must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your
          soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, 죽음.
        </p>
        <p>
          While in the <i>마법 단지, </i>you can sense and 공격 any life force within
          10 feet per 시전자 레벨(and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the
          creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life
          forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more 히트 다이스 between one creature and another and can determine
          whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative
          energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.)
        </p>
        <p>
          You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker
          creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by
          <i>악 방어 마법 </i>or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the
          creature의 soul into the <i>마법 단지 </i>unless the subject succeeds on a
          Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the
          <i>마법 단지, </i>and the target automatically succeeds on further 내성 굴림
          if you attempt to possess its body again.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host의 life force is imprisoned in the
          <i>마법 단지. </i>You keep your 지능, 지혜, 매력, 레벨, class, base 공격
          보너스, base save 보너스, 성향, and mental 능력. The body retains its 근력, 민첩, 건강, 히트 포인트, natural
          능력, and automatic 능력. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more 공격(or more advantageous
          two-weapon 공격) than normal. You can’t choose to activate the body의 extraordinary or supernatural 능력. The
          creature의 주문 and 유사주문 능력 do not stay with the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the
          <i>마법 단지 </i>if within 거리, 송신 the trapped soul back to its body. The
          spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the host body is slain, you return to the <i>마법 단지, </i>if within
          거리, and the life force of the host departs (it is 죽음). If the host body is slain beyond 거리 of the spell,
          both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the spell ends while you are in the <i>마법 단지, </i>you return to your
          body (or die if your body is out of 거리 or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return
          to your body (or die, if it is out of 거리 of your current position), and the soul in the
          <i>마법 단지 </i>returns to its body (or dies if it is out of 거리).
          Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the
          <i>마법 단지 </i>or at the host의 location.

          This spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and 말하기 its
          통보 the next time a specified event occurs. 통보, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in
          any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal
          구성요소, use 명령 words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, 이동 according to the words
          articulated; if it were placed upon a 석상, the mouth of 석상 would 이동 and appear to 말하기. Of course,
          <i>마법의 입 </i>can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or
          creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          The spell functions when specific 상태이상 are fulfilled according to your 명령 as set in the spell. 명령 can
          be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible 트리거 can be used. 트리거 react to
          what appears to be the case. 변장 and 환영술 can fool them. Normal 암흑 does not defeat a visual 트리거, but
          magical
          <i>암흑 </i>or <i>투명화 </i>does. Silent
          이동 or magical <i>침묵 </i>defeats audible 트리거. Audible 트리거 can be
          keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as 트리거 if they
          are visible or audible. A <i>마법의 입 </i>cannot distinguish 성향, 레벨,
          히트 다이스, or class except by external garb.
        </p>
        <p>
          거리 limit of a 트리거 is 15 feet per 시전자 레벨, so a 6th-레벨 caster can 명령 a
          <i>마법의 입 </i>to respond to 트리거 as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of

          You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as 비무장 공격 (instead, see
          <i>마법 송곳니</i>). A 수도사의 비무장 공격 is considered a weapon, and
          thus it can be enhanced by this spell.

          You draw an indelible mark on the subject and state some behavior on the part of the subject that will
          activate the mark. When activated, the mark curses the subject. Typically, you designate some sort of criminal
          behavior that activates the mark, but you can pick any act you please. The effect of the mark is identical
          with the effect of <i>저주 부여</i>.

          You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth of force 이세계. Each round on its turn, it may
          attempt a DC 20 지능 check to escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. If the subject doesn’t escape, the
          미로 disappears after 10 minutes, forcing the subject to leave.

        <p>
          On escaping or leaving 미로, the subject reappears where it had been when the
          <i>미로 </i>spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object,
          the subject appears in the nearest open space. 주문 and 능력 that 이동 a creature within a plane, such as
          <i>순간이동 </i>and <i>차원의 문, </i>do not
          help a creature escape a <i>미로 </i>spell, although a
          <i>이세계 전이 </i>spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in
          that spell. 미노타우로스 are not affected by this spell.

          Nothing that goes on outside the stone can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you. Minor
          physical 피해 to the stone does not 해악 you, but its partial 파괴(to the extent that you no longer fit within

          <i>유성우 </i><span>is a very powerful and spectacular spell that is similar to
            <i>화염구 </i>in many aspects. When you cast it, four 2- foot-diameter

            spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you aim a sphere at a specific creature, you may make a ranged touch 공격 to strike the target with the
          meteor. Any creature struck by one of these spheres takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning 피해(no save) and receives
          no 내성 굴림 against the sphere의 fire 피해(see below). If a targeted sphere misses its target, it simply
          explodes at the nearest corner of the target의 space. You may aim more than one meteor at the same target.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 points of fire 피해
          to each creature in 범위. If a creature is within 범위 of more than one sphere, it must save separately
          against each. (Fire 저항 applies to each sphere의 피해 individually.)

          The subject is protected from all devices and 주문 that detect, influence, or read emotions or thoughts. This
          spell protects against all 정신영향계 주문 and effects as well as information gathering by 점술 주문
          or effects. <i>정신 공백 </i>even foils
          <i>제한된 소원</i>, <i>기적</i>, and
          <i>소원 </i>주문 when they are used in such a way as to affect the subject의
          mind or to gain information about it. In the case of 염탐 that scans an 범위 the creature is in, such as
          <i>비전의 눈, </i>the spell works but the creature simply isn’t detected.
          염탐 attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.

        <p>
          You don’t so much cast a <i>기적 </i>as request one. You state what you would
          like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for 주문) intercede.
        </p>
        <p>A <i>기적 </i>can do any of the following things.</p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 16px">• </span><span>Duplicate any 사제 spell of 8th 레벨 or lower (including 주문 to which you have access because of your
            domains).
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 16px">• </span><span>Duplicate any other spell of 7 레벨 or lower.</span></p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 16px">• </span><span>Undo the harmful effects of certain 주문, such as <i>정신박약 </i>or
            <i>광기</i>.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 16px">• </span><span>Have any effect whose power 레벨 is in line with the above effects.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          If the <i>기적 </i>has any of the above effects, casting it has no 경험치
          비용.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, a 사제 can make a very powerful request. Casting such a
          <i>기적 </i>costs 사제 5,000 XP because of the powerful 신성 energies
          involved. Examples of especially powerful <i>기적 </i>of this sort could
          include the following.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 16px">• </span><span>Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 16px">• </span><span>Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to another through planar barriers
            to a specific locale with no chance of error.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 16px">• </span><span>Protecting a city from an 지진, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.</span>
        </p>
        <p>In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity의 (or 성향’s) nature is refused.</p>
        <p>
          A duplicated spell allows 내성 굴림 and 주문 저항 as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-레벨 spell.
          When a <i>기적 </i>duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay that
          cost. When a <i>기적 </i>spell duplicates a spell with a material component
          that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>XP 비용: </i><span>5,000 XP (for some uses of the <i>기적 </i>spell; see above).</span>

        <p>
          Several illusory duplicates of you pop into being, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to
          공격. The figments stay near you and disappear when struck.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>환영 복제 </i><span>creates 1d4 images plus one image per three 시전자 레벨(maximum eight images total). These figments
            separate from you and remain in a cluster, each within 5 feet of at least one other figment or you. You can
            이동 into and through a <i>환영 복제. </i>When you and the
            <i>환영 복제 </i>separate, observers can’t use 시야 or hearing to tell
            which one is you and which the image. The figments may also 이동 through each other. The figments 따라쟁이
            your actions, pretending to cast 주문 when you 주문 시전, drink 물약 when you drink 물약, 부유 when
            you 부유, and so on.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Enemies attempting to 공격 you or cast 주문 at you must select from among indistinguishable targets.
          Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. Any successful 공격 against
          an image destroys it. An image의 AC is 10 + your size 수정치 + your Dex 수정치. Figments seem to react
          normally to 범위 주문(such as looking like they’re burned or 죽음 after being hit by a
          <i>화염구</i>).
        </p>
        <p>
          While moving, you can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have learned which image is
          real are again confounded.
        </p>
        <p>
          An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or an attacker shuts his or her
          eyes, the spell has no effect. (Being unable to see carries the same 페널티 as being blinded.)

          By means of this spell, you misdirect the information from 점술 주문 that reveal auras (<i>악 감지, 마법 감지, 거짓말 식별, </i>and the like). On casting the spell, you choose another object within 거리. For 지속시간 of the spell, the
          subject of <i>눈속임 </i>is detected as if it were the other object. (Neither
          the subject nor the other object gets a 내성 굴림 against this effect.) Detection 주문 provide information
          based on the second object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the
          detection succeeds on a Will save. For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within
          거리 at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in 성향, and so forth. This spell does not affect
          other types of 점술 magic (<i>전조, 생각 감지, 투청/투시, </i>and the like).

          This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself. Once during the spell의 지속시간, you
          may choose to use its effect. This spell grants you an insight 보너스 equal to your 시전자 레벨(maximum +25)
          on any single 명중 굴림, opposed ability or skill check, or 내성 굴림. Alternatively, you can apply the
          insight 보너스 to your AC against a single 공격(even if flatfooted). Activating the effect doesn’t take an
          action; you can even activate it on another character의 turn if needed. You must choose to use the
          <i>순간 선견 </i>before you make the roll it is to modify. Once used, the
          spell ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can’t have more than one <i>순간 선견 </i>active on you at the same time.

          This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and
          troughs, with the earth reacting with glacierlike fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees,

          The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures. Its primary use

          You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional
          effects from 독, and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects,
          such as hit point 피해, temporary ability 피해, or effects that don’t go away on their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          The creature is immune to any 독 it is exposed to during 지속시간 of the spell. Unlike with
          <i>중독 지연</i>, such effects aren’t postponed until after 지속시간 —the
          creature need not make any 내성 굴림 against 독 effects applied to it during the length of the spell.

        <p>
          This spell can instead neutralize 독 in a poisonous creature or object for 지속시간 of the spell, at the

          can reduce 피해 in half again (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will save.

          This spell functions like a <i>비행 </i>spell, except you can 비행 at a 속도
          of 40 feet (30 feet if wearing medium or heavy 갑옷, or if carrying a medium or heavy load) with average
          maneuverability. When using this spell for long-distance 이동, you can 강요 without taking 비치명적인 피해(a
          forced march still requires 건강 checks). This means you can 엄폐 64 miles in an eight-hour period of flight
          (or 48 miles at a 속도 of 30 feet).

          The transmuted creature becomes wiser. The spell grants a +4 enhancement 보너스 to 지혜, adding the usual
          benefit to 지혜-related 스킬. 사제, 드루이드, 성기사, and 레인저(and other 지혜-based spellcasters) who
          receive <i>부엉이의 지혜 </i>do not gain any additional 보너스 주문 for the
          increased 지혜, but the save DCs for their 주문 increase.
