        <h3>아이템 사용</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">USING ITEMS</div>
        <p>
          To use a psionic item, it must be activated, although sometimes activation is accomplished simply by picking
          up an item or putting it on. Some items, once they are carried or worn, function constantly. In most cases,
          using an item requires a standard action that does not provoke 기회 공격. By contrast, power completion items
          (see below) are treated just like powers in 전투 and do provoke 기회 공격.
        </p>
        <p>
          Activating a psionic item is a standard action unless the item 묘사 indicates otherwise. 구현 시간 of a power
          is the time required to activate the same power in an item, whether it’s a power stone, a dorje, or a psionic
          tattoo, unless the item 묘사 specifically states otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>The four ways to activate 사이오닉 아이템 are described below.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Power Completion:</b><span>
            This is the activation method for 파워스톤. A power stone holds a power that is mostly finished. All that’s
            left to do is 공연 the short, simple, finishing parts of the manifestation (the final mental coda, as it
            were). To use a power completion item safely, a character must be of high enough 레벨 in the appropriate
            class to manifest the power already. If he can’t already manifest the power, there’s a chance he’ll make a
            mistake (see Brainburn in the power stone 묘사). Activating a power completion item is a standard action and
            provokes 기회 공격 exactly as manifesting a power does.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Powers stored in power completion items are usually not augmented, because 구현자 레벨 of such an item is
          assumed to be the minimum necessary to manifest the stored power. However, an item’s 묘사 may specify
          otherwise (some 파워스톤 have 구현자 레벨 higher than the minimum required to manifest the stored power, and
          are then assumed to be augmented as well).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Power 트리거:</b><span>
            This is the activation method for 도르제 and 사이크라운. It requires the special 지식 of power manifestation
            that a character of the appropriate class would know, and the formation of the appropriate 명령 thought. If
            a power is on a character’s 파워 목록, the character knows how to use a power 트리거 item that stores that
            power. The user must still determine what power is stored in the item before she can activate it. Activating
            a power 트리거 item is a standard action that does not provoke 기회 공격.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Powers stored in power 트리거 items are not augmented. Such powers are assumed to be stored in the item at the
          minimum 구현자 레벨 necessary to manifest the power. However, certain items may specify a higher 구현자 레벨
          than necessary. If such an item holds a power that deals hit point 피해, the power is assumed to be augmented
          to the maximum allowed by the power and 구현자 레벨.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>명령 Thought:</b><span>
            If no activation method is suggested either in the psionic item 묘사 or by the nature of the item, assume
            that a 명령 thought is needed to activate it. 명령 thought activation means that a character mentally
            projects a thought, and the item activates. No other special 지식 is needed. Activating a 명령 thought
            psionic item is a standard action that does not provoke 기회 공격.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes 명령 thought to activate an item is mentally imprinted within it and is whispered into the mind of a
          creature who picks it up. Other items are silent, but a 지식(사이오닉) or 지식(history) check might be useful
          in helping to 식별 명령 thoughts. A successful DC 30 check is needed to come up with 명령 thought in this
          case. The power <i>psionic 식별 </i>reveals 명령 thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Powers stored in 명령 thought items are usually not augmented, because 구현자 레벨 of such an item is assumed
          to be the minimum possible to manifest the stored power.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Use-Activated: </b><span>This type of psionic item simply has to be used to activate. Use activation is generally straightforward
            and self-explanatory.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears. Some items made for wearing must still be
          activated. Although this activation sometimes requires a 명령 thought (see above), usually it means mentally
          willing the activation to happen&nbsp; (a free action). 묘사 of an item states whether a 명령 thought is
          needed in such a case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated psionic item is either a standard action or not an action
          at all and does not provoke 기회 공격, unless the use involves performing an action that provokes 기회 공격 in
          itself. If the use of the item takes time before a psionic effect occurs, then use activation is a standard
          action. If the item’s activation is subsumed in its use and takes no extra time, use activation is not an
          action at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use activation doesn’t mean that if you use an item, you automatically know what it can do. You must know (or
          at least guess) what the item can do and then use the item to activate it, unless the benefit of the item
          comes automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Powers stored in use-activated items are usually not augmented, because 구현자 레벨 of such an item is assumed
          to be the minimum possible to manifest the stored power.

        <h3>사이오닉 아이템이 가진 힘에 대한 내성 굴림</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">SAVING THROWS AGAINST PSIONIC ITEM POWERS</div>
        <p>
          사이오닉 아이템 produce 사이오닉 파워. The DC of a 내성 굴림 against a power from a psionic item is always 10
          + 레벨 of the power or effect + the ability 수정치 of the minimum ability score needed to manifest that 레벨
          of power.
        </p>
        <p>Another way to figure the same number is to multiply the power’s 레벨 by 1-1/2 and add 10 to the result.</p>
        <p>
          사이크라운 are an exception to the rule. Treat 내성 굴림 as if the wielder manifested the power, including
          시전자 레벨 and all 수정치 to save DC.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some 사이오닉 아이템 take advantage of the fact that powers can be augmented to increase their 내성 굴림 DCs.
          These items are special and have their cost to create and 시장 가격 calculated using the manifester’s 레벨
          instead of the power’s 레벨.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most item 묘사 give 내성 굴림 DCs for various effects, particularly when the effect has no exact power
          equivalent (making its 레벨 otherwise difficult to quickly determine).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="h3-3-damaging-psionic-items">
        <h3>사이오닉 아이템의 피해</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">DAMAGING PSIONIC ITEMS</div>
        <p>
          A psionic item doesn’t need to make a 내성 굴림 unless it is unattended, it is specifically targeted by the
          effect, or its wielder rolls a natural 1 on his 내성 굴림. 사이오닉 아이템 should always get a save against
          powers or 주문 that might deal 피해 to them—even against 공격 from which a mundane item would normally get no
          chance to save. All types of psionic item 내성 굴림—Fortitude, Reflex, and Will—are calculated the same way:
          The item’s 내성 굴림 보너스 equals 2 + 1/2 its 구현자 레벨(round down). The only exceptions to this rule are
          intelligent 사이오닉 아이템, which make Will 내성 굴림 based on their own 지혜 scores.
        </p>
        <p>
          A psionic item, unless otherwise noted, takes 피해 as a normal item of the same type. A damaged psionic item
          continues to function, but if it is destroyed, all its psionic power is lost.
        </p>
        <section id="h4-4-repairing-items">
          <h4>아이템 수리</h4>
          <div class="original-headline">REPAIRING ITEMS</div>
          <p>
            Some 사이오닉 아이템(especially 사이오닉 무기 and 방패) may take 피해 over the course of an adventure. It
            costs no more to repair a psionic item with 제작 skill than it does to repair its nonpsionic counterpart.
            The <i>완전 수리 </i>spell can repair a damaged—but not completely broken—
            psionic item.

        <h3>지능있는 아이템</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">INTELLIGENT ITEMS</div>
        <p>
          Some 사이오닉 아이템, particularly 무기, have an 지능 all their own. Only permanent 사이오닉 아이템(as opposed
          to those that are single-use items, those that have 돌격, or those that store 파워 포인트) can be intelligent.
          (This means that 사이오닉 문신, 파워스톤, and 도르제, among other items, are never intelligent.) In general,
          less than 1% of 사이오닉 아이템 have 지능.

        <h3>저주 받은 아이템</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">CURSED ITEMS</div>
        <p>
          Some 사이오닉 아이템 are cursed—incorrectly made, or corrupted by outside forces. 저주 받은 아이템 might be
          particularly dangerous to the user, or they might be normal items with a minor f law, an inconvenient
          requirement, or an unpredictable nature. Randomly generated items are cursed 5% of the time.

        <h3>충전과 여러번 사용</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">CHARGES AND MULTIPLE USES</div>
        <p>
          Some items are limited in power by the number of 돌격 they hold or the number of 파워 포인트 they contain.
          Normally, charged items (such as 도르제) have 50 돌격 at most. If such an item is found as a random part of a
          전리품, roll d% and divide by 2 to determine the number of 돌격 left (round down, minimum 1).
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, items that contain 파워 포인트(such as 사이크라운) have a number of points equal to 50 x the 구현자
          레벨 of the creator. If such an item is found as a random part of a 전리품, roll d% and divide by 2 to
          determine the number by which 구현자 레벨 is multiplied (round down, minimum 1).
        </p>
        <p>
          시장 가격 given on the tables are always for fully charged or fully powered items. (When an item is created,
          it is fully charged or fully powered.) For an item that’s worthless when its 돌격 or 파워 포인트 달리기 out
          (which is the case for almost all charged or powered items), the value of the partially used item is
          proportional to the number of 돌격 left. For an item that has usefulness in addition to its 돌격, only part of
          the item’s value is based on the number of 돌격 left.
        </p>
        <p>Some items are single-use and expendable. Such items can often be found in sets or groups.</p>

        <h2>사이오닉 아이템 설명</h2>
        <div class="original-headline">PSIONIC ITEM DESCRIPTIONS</div>
        <p>
          In the following sections, each type of psionic item, such as 갑옷 or 사이오닉 문신, has a general 묘사,
          followed by 묘사 of specific items.
        </p>
        <p>
          General 묘사 include notes on activation, random generation, and other information. 방어도, hardness, 히트
          포인트, and break DC are given for typical examples of some types of 사이오닉 아이템. 방어도 assumes that the
          item is unattended and includes a –5 페널티 for the item’s effective 민첩 of 0. If a creature holds the item,
          use the creature’s 민첩 수정치 as an adjustment to 방어도 in place of the –5 페널티.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some individual items, notably those that simply store 사이오닉 파워, don’t get full-blown 묘사. Simply
          reference the power’s 묘사. Assume that the power is manifested at the minimum 레벨 required to manifest it,
          unless otherwise noted. Increasing 구현자 레벨 so increases the cost of the item; see 표: Estimating Magic
          Item Gold Piece Value,substituting “spell” for “power” and “시전자 레벨” for “구현자 레벨” as appropriate. The
          main reason to make 구현자 레벨 higher, or course, would be to increase the potency of the power. Raising
          구현자 레벨 is common for powers such as
          <i>영적 구조물</i>, 지속시간 of which increases with 레벨 of the manifester.
        </p>
        <p>
          Items with full 묘사 have their 능력 detailed, and each of the following aspects of these items is summarized
          at the end of 묘사.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Aura:</b><span>
            Most of the time, a <i>사이오닉 감지 </i>power will reveal 분야 associated
            with a psionic item and 근력 of the aura an item emits. This information (when applicable) is given at the
            beginning of the item’s notational entry in the form of a phrase. See the
            <i>사이오닉 감지 </i>power 묘사 for more information.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>구현자 레벨:</b><span>
            The next entry in the summary indicates 레벨 of the creator (or 구현자 레벨 of the powers placed within the
            item, if this 레벨 is lower than the actual 레벨 of the creator). 구현자 레벨 provides the item’s 내성 굴림
            보너스, as well as 거리 and other 레벨-dependent aspects of the powers of the item (if variable).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          It also determines 레벨 that must be contended with should the item come under the effect of a
          <i>사이오닉 무효화 </i>power or a similar situation. This information is
          given in the form “ML x,” where “ML” is an abbreviation for manifester
        </p>
        <p>레벨 and “x” is an ordinal number representing 구현자 레벨 itself.</p>
        <p>
          For 사이오닉 문신, 파워스톤, and 도르제, the creator can set 구현자 레벨 of an item at any number high enough
          to manifest the stored power and not higher than her own 구현자 레벨. For other 사이오닉 아이템, the item
          itself determines 구현자 레벨. In this case, the creator’s 구현자 레벨 must be as high as the item’s 구현자
          레벨(and 전제조건 may effectively put a higher minimum on the creator’s 레벨).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>전제조건:</b><span>
            Certain 필요조건 must be met in order for a character to create a psionic item. These include 특기, powers,
            and 기타 필요조건 such as 레벨, 성향, and race or kind. 전제조건 for creation of an item are given in the
            summary immediately following the item’s 구현자 레벨.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          A power prerequisite can be provided by a character who knows the power, or through the use of a power
          completion or power 트리거 psionic item or a psi-like ability that produces the desired power effect. For each
          day that passes during the creation process, the creator must expend one power completion item (such as a
          power stone) or 1 돌격 from a power 트리거 item (such as a dorje), if either of those objects is used to
          supply a prerequisite.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the creation of an item, with each participant
          providing one or more of 전제조건. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary, such as if one character
          knows some of the powers necessary to create an item and another character knows the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they must agree among themselves who will be considered
          the creator for 목적 of determinations where the creator’s 레벨 must be known. (It’s sensible, although not
          mandatory, for the highest-레벨 character involved to be considered the creator.) The character designated as
          the creator pays the experience points required to make the item.

          Typically, a list of 전제조건 includes one feat and one or more powers (or some other requirement in addition
          to the feat). When two powers at the end of a list are separated by “or,” one of those powers is required in
          addition to every other power mentioned prior to the last two.

          <b>시장 가격:</b><span>
            This gold piece value, given in the summary following the word “Price,” represents the price someone should
            expect to pay to buy the item. 시장 가격 are also included on the random generation tables for easy
            reference. 시장 가격 of an item that can be constructed with a psionic item creation feat is usually equal
            to the base price + the price for any 구성요소(특수 재료 or experience point expenditure).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Cost to Create:</b><span>
            The cost in gold pieces and experience points to create the item is given in the summary following the word
            “Cost.” This information appears only for items with 구성요소(material or experience points) that make their
            시장 가격 higher than their base prices. The cost to create includes the costs derived from the base cost
            plus the cost of 구성요소. Items without 구성요소 do not have a “Cost” entry. For them, 시장 가격 and base
            price are the same. The cost in gold pieces is 1/2 시장 가격, and the cost in experience points is 1/25 시장
            가격.

        <p>
          <b>Weight: </b><span>The notational entry for many items ends with a value for the item’s weight. When a weight figure is not
            given, the item has no weight worth noting (for 목적 of determining how much of a load a character can
            carry).</span>

            In general, psionic 갑옷 및 방패 follow the rules for the equivalent 마법 아이템, as far as enhancement
            보너스, stacking, and other base 능력 are concerned. An enhancement 보너스 is treated the same way
            regardless of whether magic or 사이오닉 created it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Psionic 갑옷 및 방패 differ from standard and magical equivalents in that psionic 갑옷 및 방패 incorporate
            one or more crystals into their 제작. Particularly powerful 갑옷 및 방패 may be entirely composed of
            brightly hued or transparent crystals.

          <p>
            <b>특성:</b><span>
              Roll d%. An 01 result indicates the item is intelligent, an 02–31 result indicates that 명령 thought (if
              any) is psionically imprinted and whispers itself into the user’s mind on acquisition, and 32–100
              indicates no 특성.</span>

          <p>
            지능있는 아이템 have extra 능력 and sometimes also extraordinary powers and special 목적. Substitute

                The wearer of this kind of 갑옷 gains 저항 10 against energy 공격(acid, cold, electricity, fire, or
                sonic). 갑옷 absorbs the first 10 points of 피해 dealt by any such 공격, and this absorption causes it
                to radiate 빛 for a number of rounds equal to the points of 피해 absorbed. This 빛 is sufficient to
                illuminate a 60-foot-radius 범위.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              If 갑옷 absorbs more 피해 while it is radiating 빛, the newer radiant effect overlaps (does not stack
              with) the effect that was already in place.

              <b>Ranged:</b><span>
                The wielder of a ranged 방패 can throw it in 전투, with a 거리 increment of 30 feet. While in the air,
                방패 is treated in all ways as a ranged weapon and cannot be blocked or grabbed except by those with
                appropriate 특기. No matter the size of the wielder, a buckler or 빛 방패 deals 1d6 points of 피해 and a
                heavy one 1d8 points. (A tower 방패 cannot be created with this special ability.) The wielder’s 근력
                수정치 and 방패’s enhancement 보너스 add to the base 피해.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              A ranged 방패 flies through the air back to the creature that threw it. It returns to the wielder just
              before the creature’s next turn (and is therefore 준비 to use again in that turn).
            </p>
            <p>
              Catching a ranged 방패 when it comes back is a free action. If the wielder can’t catch it, or if the
              wielder has moved since throwing it, 방패 drops to the ground in the square from which it was thrown.

          <h3>무기</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">WEAPONS</div>
          <p>
            Although they generally follow the rules for 마법 무기, 사이오닉 무기 differ from mundane and 마법 무기 in
            their design. Most possess some crystal 구성요소, and some are composed entirely of crystal. Many also sport
            intricate traceries along the blade or haft, which flicker now and then as if channeling flows of psychic
            energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            사이오닉 무기 have enhancement 보너스 ranging from +1 to +5. They apply these 보너스 on both 공격 and 피해
            rolls when used in 전투. This enhancement 보너스 is effective for 목적 of overcoming creatures with 피해
            저항 that is penetrated by magic. All 사이오닉 무기 are also 명품 무기, but their masterwork 보너스 on 명중
            굴림 does not stack with their enhancement 보너스 on 명중 굴림.
          </p>
          <p>
            무기 come in two basic categories: melee and ranged. Some of 무기 listed as melee 무기 can also be used as
            ranged 무기. In this case, their enhancement 보너스 applies to either type of 공격.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to enhancement 보너스, 사이오닉 무기 can also have 특수 능력 detailed here. A weapon with a
            special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement 보너스.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rules for 구현자 레벨 for 무기(called 시전자 레벨), additional 피해 주사위, ranged 무기 and ammunition,
            ammunition and breakage, hardness and 히트 포인트, critical hits, and 무기 for unusually sized creatures for
            사이오닉 무기 are the same as for 마법 무기<i>. </i>사이오닉 무기 do not
            have the chance to generate 빛(though some may be mentally audible; see below).
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Mentally Audible:</b><span>
              Fully 30% of 사이오닉 무기 telepathically mutter, croon, recite battle poems, scream, or produce other
              mental “noises” when first drawn, at first blood, or when they slay a significant enemy. Such a weapon
              cannot be concealed from creatures within 15 feet when it is drawn, nor can its mental “soundtrack” be
              curbed.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Activation:</b><span>
              Usually a character benefits from a 사이오닉 무기 in the same way a character benefits from a mundane
              weapon—by attacking with it. If a weapon has a special ability that the user needs to activate, then the
              user usually needs to project a 명령 thought (a standard action).</span>

              Most 사이오닉 무기 have only enhancement 보너스. They can also have 특수 능력 detailed here. A weapon with

              <b>Bodyfeeder:</b><span>
                All feeder 무기 have a special ability that functions only upon scoring a successful critical hit. A
                bodyfeeder weapon grants its wielder 임시 히트 포인트 equal to the total 피해 dealt by a successful
                critical hit. These 임시 히트 포인트 last for 10 minutes. Thus, if the wielder of a bodyfeeder weapon
                successfully scores a critical hit while the wielder still enjoys 임시 히트 포인트 from a previous
                critical hit, the wielder gains only the better of the two values: either his current number of 임시
                히트 포인트, or the new influx of 임시 히트 포인트, whichever is higher.</span>

                target has none (effectively, its hit point 피해 is converted to 파워 포인트). Constructs and undead are
                not subject to mindfeeder 무기. As with 임시 히트 포인트, temporary 파워 포인트 do not stack with each

                A power storing weapon allows a manifester to store a single targeted power of up to 5 파워 포인트 in
                the weapon. (The power must have a 구현 시간 of 1 standard action.) Any time the weapon strikes a
                creature and the creature takes 피해 from it, the weapon can immediately manifest the power on that
                creature as a swift action if the wielder desires. (This ability is an exception to the rule that
                manifesting a power from an item takes at least as long as manifesting that power normally.) Once the
                power is manifested, the weapon is empty, and a manifester can imbed any other targeted power of up to 5
                파워 포인트 into it. The weapon telepathically whispers to the wearer 이름 of the power currently stored
                within it. A randomly generated power storing weapon has a 50% chance to have a power stored in it
                already.</span>

                This negative 레벨 remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer
                wielded. This negative 레벨 never results in actual 레벨 손실, but it cannot be overcome in any way
                while the weapon is wielded. Psibane bows, crossbows, and 무릿매 bestow this ability upon their
                ammunition.</span>

                A psychic weapon’s power depends on its wielder. In the hands of a nonpsionic creature, the weapon
                possesses the qualities of a nonmagical, nonpsionic masterwork weapon. When wielded by a psionic
                creature, this weapon has an enhancement 보너스 based on the wielder’s current power point reserve, as
                shown on the following table. The weapon’s enhancement 보너스 decreases as the wielder spends 파워
                포인트, and it increases whenever the wielder gains enough 파워 포인트(by any means) to put his power
                point reserve into the next higher category.</span>

            <b>Physical 묘사: </b><span>A <i>cognizance crystal </i>consists of a core crystal and two or three
              smaller crystals arranged in specific positions around it on strands of silver wire. The crystals give off
              a faint glow. A typical <i>cognizance crystal </i>weighs approximately 1
              pound, has AC 7, 10 히트 포인트, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 16.</span>

              The user must merely hold or have a crystal on her person for a period of at least 10 minutes (which is
              long enough to attune oneself to the crystal). Thereafter, the owner can use 파워 포인트 stored in the
              crystal to manifest powers she knows.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            The maximum number of points a <i>cognizance crystal </i>can store is
            always an odd number and is never more than 17. It can store only as many 파워 포인트 as its original
            maximum, set at the time of its creation. When a
            <i>cognizance crystal’s </i>파워 포인트 are used up, the glow of the
            crystal dims. However, the user can recharge it by paying 파워 포인트 on a 1-for-1 basis. While doing this
            depletes the user’s own power point reserve for the day, those 파워 포인트 remain available in the
            <i>cognizance crystal </i>until used.
          </p>
          <p>
            A user cannot directly replenish her personal 파워 포인트 from those stored in a
            <i>cognizance crystal, </i>nor can she draw 파워 포인트 from more than one
            source to manifest a power. See 저장된 파워 포인트 사용하기 for more information.

          <div class="original-headline">DORJES</div>
          <p>
            A dorje is a slender crystal that contains a single power. Each dorje has 50 돌격 when created, and each
            돌격 expended allows one use of that power. A dorje that 달리기 out of 돌격 is just a simple crystal.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Physical 묘사:</b><span>
              A typical dorje is an elongated crystal of one color (or colorless), between 8 inches and 10 inches long
              and about 1/2 inch thick, which can weigh up to 1/4 pound. Occasionally, a dorje is decorated with
              carvings or inscribed 달리기 along a face of the crystal. A typical dorje has AC 7, 7 히트 포인트, a
              hardness of 8, and a break DC of 18.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Activation:</b><span>
              도르제 use the power 트리거 activation method, so manifesting a power from a dorje is usually a standard
              action that does not provoke 기회 공격. (If the power being manifested has a 구현 시간 longer than 1
              standard action, however, it takes that long to manifest the power from a dorje.) The user must have the
              power on his class list, even if he knows 명령 thought. Additionally, to activate a dorje, a character
              must hold it in hand and point it in the general direction of the target or 범위 to be affected.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            도르제 are normally created at the minimum 구현자 레벨 required to manifest the power, and powers that can
            be augmented are not augmented when stored in a dorje. A dorje’s wielder cannot augment the power contained
            within the dorje. However, 도르제 can be created at a higher 구현자 레벨 than required to manifest the
            power. In this case, the dorje that holds an augmentable power is augmented, to the limit of 구현자 레벨 and
            the power’s augmentation maximums, if any. 구현자 레벨 of a dorje cannot be more than five higher than the
            minimum 구현자 레벨 to use the power it contains.

          <h3>파워스톤</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">POWER STONES</div>
          <p>
            A power stone stores a power (or collection of powers). A stored power can be used only once, “flushing” the
            stone. Using a power stone is basically like manifesting a power.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Physical 묘사:</b><span>
              A power stone is a thumb-sized chunk of crystal that possesses a barely detectable interior glow if it
              holds a low-레벨 power. A stone imprinted with more than one power or a higher-레벨 power glows more
              brightly, but never enough to provide illumination in its own right. A typical power stone has AC 7, 5
              히트 포인트, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 20.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Activation:</b><span>
              To activate a power stone, a manifester must mentally address it, as described below. Once the power is
              known, the power stone is treated as a power completion item, except as noted below.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Addressing the Stone: </i><span>A power stone must be “addressed” before a character can use it or know exactly what power it contains.
              Doing this requires a successful 사이크래프트 check (DC 15 + power 레벨). Once a particular power stone
              has been addressed, it is not necessary to do so again. Addressing a power stone in advance lets a
              character proceed directly to the next step when the time comes to use it.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Using a stone’s stored power after addressing the stone requires holding the stone and willing the power’s
            manifestation, as if manifesting a power normally (a standard action). Activating a power stone is subject
            to disruption just as manifesting a power normally would be.
          </p>
          <p>Additionally, the user must meet the following 필요조건.</p>
          <p>• The user must have the power on his or her class list.</p>
          <p>• The user must have the requisite 핵심 능력 score.</p>
          <p>
            If the user meets these 필요조건 and has a 구현자 레벨 at least equal to the power’s 구현자 레벨, she can
            automatically manifest the stored power without a check. If she meets both 필요조건 but her own 레벨 is
            lower than the power stone’s 구현자 레벨, she has to make a 구현자 레벨 check (1d20 + user’s 레벨), against
            a DC equal to the power stone’s 구현자 레벨 +1, to manifest the power successfully. On a failure, the user
            must succeed on a DC 5 지혜 check to avoid brainburn (see below). A natural roll of 1 on this check is
            always a failure.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Determine Effect: </i><span>A power successfully manifested from a power stone works exactly as if manifested normally. Assume the
              power stone’s 구현자 레벨 is always the minimum 레벨 required to manifest the power for the character who
              imprinted the stone, unless the creator specifically desires otherwise.</span>
          </p>
          <p>A power stone’s glow fades when its stored power is flushed.</p>
          <p>
            <i>Brainburn: </i><span>When something goes awry, the user of a power stone improperly manifests the stored power. The resultant
              psionic surge persists for 1d4 rounds, unless the power stone is flung farther than 100 feet away or is
              destroyed. This surge deals 1d6 points of 피해 per power stored per round and arcs across multiple
              targets, similar to <i>에너지 흐름</i>, except 피해 type isn’t specified.
              The user is the primary target, and one nearby ally is the secondary target (chosen at random).</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            구현자 레벨 for a standard power stone is the minimum 구현자 레벨 needed to manifest the power (unless
            otherwise specified).

          <div class="original-headline">PSICROWNS</div>
          <p>
            A psicrown is a special headband that stores several powers. Unlike 도르제, which can contain a wide variety
            of powers, each psicrown is of a certain kind and holds specific powers. Unless otherwise stated, a psicrown
            has 파워 포인트 equal to 50 x its 구현자 레벨 when created. These 파워 포인트 can be spent only on the
            powers that are contained in the psicrown.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Physical 묘사:</b><span>
              A typical psicrown is large enough to fit on the head of a Medium creature. Some 사이크라운 are actually
              crownlike and heavily adorned, while others are simple headbands with crystal centerpieces. All 사이크라운
              weigh less than 1 pound. Most 사이크라운 are metallic, but one could potentially be composed of any
              material. Metallic 사이크라운 have AC 10, 10 히트 포인트, hardness 8, and a break DC of 28. 사이크라운
              made of psionically reinforced silk have AC 7, 10 히트 포인트, hardness 2, and a break DC of 24.
              사이크라운 can be made from other, more exotic materials, but all have at least 근력 and durability of
              사이크라운 made of psionically reinforced silk.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Activation:</b><span>
              사이크라운 use the power 트리거 activation method, so manifesting a power from a psicrown is usually a
              standard action that does not provoke 기회 공격. (If the power being manifested, however, has a longer

            <p>
              사이크라운 have immense utility because they pack so many capabilities into one item and because they use
              the wearer’s ability score and relevant 특기 to set the DC for 내성 굴림 against their powers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike with other sorts of 사이오닉 아이템, the wearer can use his 구현자 레벨 when activating the power
              of a psicrown if it’s higher than 구현자 레벨 of the psicrown.
            </p>
            <p>
              The minimum 구현자 레벨 of a psicrown is 8th. 구현자 레벨 of a psicrown cannot be more than five 레벨
              higher than the minimum 구현자 레벨 for the highest-레벨 power in the psicrown. Standard 사이크라운 are
              described below.

          <h3>사이오닉 문신</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">PSIONIC TATTOOS</div>
          <p>
            사이오닉 문신 are designs scribed on the skin that manifest powers on their wearers. The wearer doesn’t get
            to make any decisions about the tattoo’s effect—the manifester who scribed it has already done so.
          </p>
          <p>
            사이오닉 문신 can vary in size, but a creature can wear only a total of twenty tattoos at one
            time—attempting to add one more than this maximum causes all previously scribed tattoos to simultaneously
            activate. A psionic tattoo fades away after use.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Physical 묘사:</b><span>
              A typical psionic tattoo is a colorful pattern of tiny, interlacing lines within a larger design. This
              design can be as simple as a circle or a star, or as complex as an artist 소원 to make it. Once it is
              scribed, a tattoo’s design does not change. A psionic tattoo usually 엄폐 an 범위 of skin no more than 5
              inches in diameter (larger ones could be designed, but would have no added effect).</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Scribing and Transferring Tattoos:</b><span>
              구현자 레벨 of a psionic tattoo is the minimum 레벨 required to manifest the scribed power. A psionic
              tattoo can contain only powers of 3rd 레벨 or lower.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            A psionic tattoo inscribed on a wearer is potentially more mobile than a mundane tattoo. As a standard
            action, the wearer can will the tattoo to 이동 to a different part of his body or onto the skin of any
            willing (or unconscious) living creature he touches. If the wearer of a psionic tattoo is rendered
            unconscious or is slain, another sentient creature can touch the tattoo while willing it to leave the
            previous wearer and apply itself to the new creature as a standard action. 사이오닉 문신 cannot overlay one
            another.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Identifying 사이오닉 문신: </b><span>In addition to the standard methods of identification, the wearer of a tattoo can concentrate on it and
              attempt to gain some sense of how it would feel if activated. A successful DC 13 지능 check provides a
              hint to the tattoo’s effect.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Activation: </b><span>A psionic tattoo produces its effect when touched by its wearer and willed to do so. This activity,
              called “tapping” the tattoo, is a standard action that provokes 기회 공격. A psionic tattoo fades away
              after use.</span>
          </p>
          <p>The following rules govern the use of 사이오닉 문신.</p>
          <p>
            • A creature must have an appropriate physical surface on which to scribe the pattern (thus, incorporeal
            creatures or creatures with impermanent flesh, such as 불의 정령, cannot use 사이오닉 문신).
          </p>
          <p>
            • Tapping a psionic tattoo provokes 기회 공격. A successful 공격(including grappling 공격) against the
            wearer forces a 집중 check. A wearer who fails this check cannot concentrate effectively on the tattoo to
            use it. The tattoo remains untapped, and the wearer can make another attempt.
          </p>
          <p>
            • A character can 트리거 the effects of another’s psionic tattoo if the other wearer is unconscious. It is a
            full-round action to find, touch, and concentrate on an unconscious creature’s tattoo in order to tap it.
          </p>
          <p>
            구현자 레벨 for a standard psionic tattoo is the minimum 구현자 레벨 needed to manifest the power (unless
            otherwise specified).

              <b>Crawling Tattoos:</b><span>
                Crawling tattoos resemble standard 사이오닉 문신, but their effects are often harmful rather than
                beneficial. Like a psionic tattoo, a crawling tattoo can be scribed only with a power of no higher than
                3rd 레벨 that targets one or more creatures. Exceptions are the
                <i>신체 보정 </i>power, which can be scribed even though it affects
                only the manifester, and 정신감응(충동) powers, which cannot be scribed at all. Powers that normally
                have an 범위 affect only one target if scribed in a crawling tattoo. Powers with an experience point
                requirement cannot be scribed into a crawling tattoo. Otherwise, crawling tattoos are treated as
                사이오닉 문신 until they are activated by the wearer.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              The wearer of a crawling tattoo can tap the tattoo as a standard action that provokes 기회 공격, mentally
              specifying a target (to which the wearer must have line of sight). Instead of manifesting its stored
              power, the tattoo animates, drops to the ground, and scuttles toward the target. The original wearer need
              no longer concentrate on the tattoo once animated.
            </p>
            <p>
              The animated tattoo 이동 toward its designated target in the same round when it is activated. Treat it as
              a Fine construct that has AC 18, 10 히트 포인트, a hardness of 5, 속도 30 feet, and 보너스 on 명중 굴림
              equal to the wearer’s 구현자 레벨 + his 핵심 능력 수정치. Crawling tattoos, unlike true constructs, are
              subject to 환영술, 암흑, 안개, and similar effects. Should the target be killed, 순간이동 away, or
              otherwise absent itself before the animated tattoo reaches it, the wearer can reclaim the tattoo. If it is
              destroyed, a crawling tattoo 분쇄 and evaporates.
            </p>
            <p>
              A crawling tattoo must enter the target’s square to 공격 and thus provokes 기회 공격 as it passes through
              the target’s threatened 범위. The tattoo makes one touch 공격&nbsp; per round thereafter until it strikes
              its target or is destroyed. On a successful 공격, the power scribed in the crawling tattoo affects the
              target if the target fails the appropriate 내성 굴림; however, powers that normally allow a Reflex 내성
              굴림 automatically affect the touched target. Crawling tattoos can ferry beneficial powers as well as
              harmful ones, and a target can allow the tattoo’s touch 공격 to succeed if he or she desires.
            </p>
            <p>Two examples of crawling tattoos are described below; many more types are possible.</p>

            <p>
              <b>Crystal Anchor: </b><span>A <i>crystal anchor </i>is a shaft of transparent crystal 4 to 5 feet
                in length, with a sharpened, spearlike head on one end. It ensnares the minds of those within 거리 who
                manifest powers of a specified psionic 분야. The triggering 분야 is specified at the time of
                creation.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              A <i>crystal anchor </i>is activated by plunging the sharp head into the
              ground, leaving the shaft freestanding. It projects an invisible, 30-foot-radius field. If a power from
              the speci- fied 분야 is manifested within this 거리, the manifester must succeed on a Will save (DC 15 +
              power 레벨) or become subject to an effect similar to <i>두뇌 잠금</i>,
              except that the effect is permanent until dispelled or dismissed by the individual who initially drove the
              <i>crystal anchor </i>into the earth. Any anchor can be pulled out of the
              ground and reused at a later time.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a <i>crystal anchor </i>successfully ensnares a target, a slender
              filament of insubstantial ectoplasm connects the victim to the shaft, even one outside the original 범위
              of the field.
            </p>
            <p>
              A <i>crystal anchor </i>can attempt to ensnare a victim only five times
              per day. Previously caught targets can remain caught day after day and do not count against this daily
              limit on attempts.

              <b>Psychoactive Skins:</b><span>
                Psychoactive skins (also sometimes called ectoshells) are fistsized globs of psionically charged
                ectoplasm. As a standard action, a psychoactive skin spreads over and 엄폐 a Medium or smaller creature
                that projects the proper 명령 thought; the same 명령 thought causes the skin to shrink back down to its
                former size. Each of the various psychoactive skins is charged with one of a wide array of powers that
                constantly affect the wearer.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              A deployed skin completely 엄폐 the wearer and all his 장비 like a second skin, allowing the wearer to
              see, hear, and breathe normally. It rolls away from various parts of the body as needed, such as when the
              wearer needs to eat or access a backpack. Held items or items specifically excluded are not covered by a
              psychoactive skin.
            </p>
            <p>
              Up to three skins can be worn simultaneously, although only the outermost is active in any given round
              (the powers of hidden skins cannot be manifested). Skin layers can be changed with a 명령 thought as a
              standard action, which causes a lower-layer skin to come to the surface.

                This monastic tome describes ancient techniques of mental focus and is highly prized by psionic

                the next 레벨 of experience. Those who use their powers for evil are punished for their impertinence,
                losing 5d6 x 1,000 XP for defiling the book. In addition, an evil reader must make an immediate DC 15

            <div class="original-headline">Major Artifacts</div>
            <p>
              상급 유물 are unique items—only one of each such item exists. They are difficult to find and dangerous to
              handle, but once found, are often even more difficult to destroy. A major psionic artifact has only a
              single, specific means of 파괴.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Annulus: </b><span>This artifact is the ultimate psionic nullifier. Forged to keep enemies of vast psionic power at bay,
                the <i>Annulus </i>is an artifact that any psionic being should 공포.
                It has been forgotten in the modern 나이, and merely finding it would precipitate a great upheaval
                across 이세계.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              The <i>Annulus </i>is a 1-foot-diameter ring of silvery material. Tiny
              slots, antennae, spheres, and other intricate projections decorate the exterior of the hoop; however, two
              smoothed lengths of the ring provide an adequate surface for grasping the item.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <i>Annulus </i>has several powers, all of which require a wielder to
              tightly grasp the ring with at least one hand. When it is first grasped, 지식 of the artifact’s powers
              immediately flood the wielder’s mind. The wielder can access all powers of the
              <i>Annulus </i>at 구현자 레벨 20th.
            </p>
            <p>
              • The <i>Annulus </i>generates a continuous
              <i>캐텁시 </i>effect within a 100-foot-radius of the wielder (who is
              unaffected).
            </p>
            <p>
              • The wielder gains a +4 enhancement 보너스 on any attempt to resist an effect that deals ability 피해.
            </p>
            <p>
              • Once per day, the wielder can 트리거 <i>초대형폭파 </i>as a standard
              action.
            </p>
            <p>
              • Three times per day, as a standard action, the wielder can 트리거 an effect similar to
              <i>psionic 차원의 닻 </i>that affects all creatures in a 50-foot radius.
            </p>
            <p>
              The primary power of the <i>Annulus, </i>however, is psionic
              nullification. Once per year, the wielder can 트리거 this effect as a special action requiring 10 rounds
              of continuous 집중 to complete. The wielder specifies a target or targets within a 100-foot radius,
              ranging from a specific psionic individual or item to a group of psionic beings that share the same
              philosophy. The nullification effect is accompanied by blasts of 빛, heat, and sound from the
              <i>Annulus. </i>Nonpsionic creatures and items are unaffected, as are
              nontargeted beings, but any psionic target—regardless of any protection it may possess—분해 in a terrific
              explosion. Nothing is left but floating dust.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is relatively easy to nullify a single target or a small group of targets, but nullifying a more
              powerful being (such as a demigod or 상급 entity) or another major artifact taxes the
              <i>Annulus </i>to its limits. If it is used to nullify such a target, the
              artifact succeeds but is destroyed in the process and cannot be retrieved by any means.

            <p>
              The wearer of the <i>Psicrown of the Crystal Mind </i>also gains 파워
              저항 equal to 10 + his 구현자 레벨.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <i>Psicrown of the Crystal Mind </i>has 1,000 파워 포인트 when
              discovered. Anyone who dons the crown instantly knows the number of 파워 포인트 it has at the current
              time. The crown recharges itself, gaining back 1 power point per day if it currently has fewer than 1,000
              points.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a special one-time use of the psicrown, the wearer can channel all the remaining 돌격 in the psicrown
              into an uncontrolled 폭발 of energy. The wearer 트리거 this use as a standard action. All within 20 feet
              of the wearer take 히트 포인트 of 피해 equal to half 파워 포인트 left in the staff (Reflex DC 18 half).
              The wearer inhabits a tiny eye of calm at the center of 파괴 and is unharmed, but the psicrown is reduced
              to a burned-out cinder.

          <div class="original-headline">Creating Dorjes</div>
          <p>
            To create a dorje, a character needs a small supply of materials, the most obvious being a chunk of crystal
            or 수정 조각 of the dorje to be carved from or assembled. The cost of the materials is subsumed in the cost
            of creating the dorje—375 gp x 레벨 of the power x 레벨 of the manifester. 도르제 are always fully charged
            (50 돌격) when created.
          </p>
          <p>
            If an augmentable power is incorporated into a dorje at a higher 구현자 레벨 than the minimum 레벨 required
            to manifest the power, each discharge of the power from the dorje is augmented to the limit of that higher
            구현자 레벨. Alternatively, if you want to have a higher 구현자 레벨 in the dorje, you must pay for the
            dorje as if the power was one 레벨 higher for each additional two 구현자 레벨 you want.
          </p>
          <p>
            The creator must know the power or powers to be imprinted in the dorje (or must have the power available in
            some other form). If manifesting the power would reduce the manifester’s experience point total, she pays
            the cost (multiplied by 50) upon beginning the dorje in addition to 경험치 비용 for making the dorje itself.
            The act of working on the dorje costs a number of 파워 포인트 per day equal to the power point cost of the
            power that is being embedded in the crystal of the dorje.

          <p>Crafting a dorje requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.</p>

          <p>
            To create a power stone, a character needs a supply of incense and fine etching tools, the cost of which is
            subsumed in the cost of encoding the power stone—12.5 gp x 레벨 of the power x 레벨 of the manifester. All
            materials used to imprint a power stone must be fresh and unused. A character must pay the full cost for
            encoding each power stone no matter how many times she previously has imprinted the same power.

            The creator must know the power or powers to be imprinted in the power stone (or must have the power

            To create a psicrown, a character needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being a circlet, crown, or
            the pieces of the crown to be assembled. The cost of the materials is subsumed in the cost of creating the
            psicrown—375 gp x 레벨 of the highest-레벨 power x 레벨 of the manifester, + 75% of the value of the next
            highest-레벨 power (281.25 gp x 레벨 of the power x 레벨 of the manifester), + one-half of the value of any
            other powers (187.5 gp x 레벨 of the power x 레벨 of the manifester). 사이크라운 are always created with
            full 파워 포인트.

            The creator must know the power or powers to be imprinted in the psicrown (or must have the power available
            in some other form). If any of the powers has an XP cost, the creator must provide XP equal to 50 x that
            cost. This expense is in addition to 경험치 비용 for making the psicrown itself. The act of working on a
            psicrown costs a number of 파워 포인트 per day equal to the cost of manifesting each of the powers
            associated with the psicrown once per day.

          <p>
            The creator of a psionic tattoo must have a patch of uncovered skin free of hair and fur, and at least a few
            containers in which to mix dyes. In addition, he needs 특수 재료, usually to create dyes. The costs for
            materials and dyes are subsumed in the cost for scribing the psionic tattoo— 25 gp x 레벨 of the power x
            레벨 of the manifester. All ingredients and materials used to scribe a psionic tattoo must be fresh and
            unused. The character must pay the full cost for scribing each psionic tattoo. (Economies of scale do not
            apply.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The user of the psionic tattoo is both the manifester and the target; therefore, powers that target another
            creaturecannot be stored in psionic tattoo form. Powers with a 거리 of personal can be made into 사이오닉

          <p>
            To create a universal item, a character usually needs some sort of 장비 or tools to work on the item. He
            also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the item itself or the pieces of the item to be

            are difficult to formularize. Refer to 표: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Valuesand use the given item
            prices as a guideline. Creating an item costs half the market value listed.
          </p>
          <p>
            If powers are involved in 전제조건 for making the item, the creator must know the power to be placed in the

            incurred by the creator of the item. The act of working on the item requires a payment of 파워 포인트

        <div class="original-headline">SPECIAL MATERIALS</div>
        <p>In addition to 사이오닉 아이템 with imbedded powers, some substances have innate special properties.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Crystal, Deep: </b><span>Deep crystal is crystal of above-average quality found at the hearts of large veins or deposits of mundane
            crystal (see below). Deep crystal is renowned for its 근력 and its psionically resonant nature. Mundane
            crystal is used for many items of psionic manufacture, such as 도르제, 파워스톤, and 정신결정. Deep crystal
            is a better grade.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          While a weapon made of deep crystal is no different from a mundane crystal weapon for a nonpsionic character,
          a psionic wielder of a deep crystal weapon can focus psionic power through it, increasing 피해 that weapon
          deals. As a free action that does not provoke 기회 공격, the wielder can channel psionic power into a melee
          weapon or ranged weapon made of deep crystal. For 2 파워 포인트, the deep crystal weapon deals an extra 2d6
          points of 피해. The weapon will stay charged for 1 minute or until it scores its next hit. Bows, crossbows,
          and 무릿매 bestow this power on their ammunition. All missile 무기 lose this effect if they miss. However,
          they may be recovered and charged again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any weapon made of deep crystal costs 1,000 gp more than its noncrystal counterpart. Any item could
          potentially be made out of deep crystal. Because deep crystal 갑옷 is considered to be made out of metal,
          드루이드 cannot wear it.
        </p>
        <p>Deep crystal has 30 히트 포인트 per inch of thickness and a hardness of 10.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Crystal, Mundane:</b><span>
            Mundane crystal can be used in place of metal in 무기 or 갑옷, using a special forging process. The
            fortified crystal possesses the properties of a similar masterwork steel weapon or 갑옷, except for visual
            appearance.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          무기 and 갑옷 made of mundane crystal cost the same amount to make as their masterwork counterparts. Any item
          could potentially be made with mundane crystal. Because mundane crystal 갑옷 is considered to be made out of
          metal, 드루이드 cannot wear it.
        </p>
        <p>Mundane crystal properly forged has 25 히트 포인트 per inch of thickness and a hardness of 8.</p>
