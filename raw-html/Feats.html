          Some 특기 have 전제조건. Your character must have the indicated ability score, class feature, feat, skill,
          기본 공격 보너스, or other quality designated in order to select or use that feat. A character can gain a feat
          at the same 레벨 at which he or she gains the prerequisite.

        <p>
          Some 특기 are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a group. Others are 아이템 제작 특기,
          which allow spellcasters to create 마법 아이템 of all sorts. A 메타마법 feat lets a spellcaster prepare and
          주문 시전 with 상급 effect, albeit as if the spell were a higher spell 레벨 than it actually is.

            Any feat designated as a 전사 feat can be selected as a 전사’s 보너스 feat. This designation does not

          <h3>아이템 제작 특기</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">ITEM CREATION FEATS</div>
          <p>
            An item creation feat lets a spellcaster create a magic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of
            items they involve, the various 아이템 제작 특기 all have certain features in common.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>XP Cost:</b><span>
              Experience that the spellcaster would normally keep is expended when making a magic item. The XP cost
              equals 1/25 of the cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he
              or she loses a 레벨. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new 레벨, he or she can immediately
              expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance a 레벨.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Raw Materials Cost:</b><span> The cost of creating a magic item equals one-half the sale cost of the item.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Using an item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or magical workshop, special tools, and so
            on. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Time:</b><span>
              The time to create a magic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one
              day.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Item Cost:</b><span>
              포션 제조, 마법막대 제작, and 마법두루마리 제작 create items that directly reproduce spell effects, and
              the power of these items depends on their 시전자 레벨—that is, a spell from such an item has the power it
              would have if cast by a spellcaster of that 레벨. The price of these items (and thus the XP cost and the
              cost of the raw materials) also depends on 시전자 레벨. 시전자 레벨 must be high enough that the
              spellcaster creating the item can cast the spell at that 레벨. To find the final price in each case,
              multiply 시전자 레벨 by the spell 레벨, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below:</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>두루마리: </i><span>Base price = spell 레벨 x 시전자 레벨 x 25 gp.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Potions: </i><span>Base price = spell 레벨 x 시전자 레벨 x 50 gp.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>마법막대: </i><span>Base price = spell 레벨 x 시전자 레벨 x 750 gp.</span>
          </p>
          <p>A 0-레벨 spell is considered to have a spell 레벨 of 1/2 for 목적 of this calculation.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Extra Costs: </b><span>Any potion, scroll, or wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also
              carries a commensurate cost. For potions and 두루마리, the creator must expend the material component or
              pay the XP cost when creating the item.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            For a wand, the creator must expend fifty copies of the material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.
          </p>
          <p>Some 마법 아이템 similarly incur extra costs in material 구성요소 or XP, as noted in their 묘사.</p>

          <h3>메타마법 특기</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">METAMAGIC FEATS</div>
          <p>
            As a spellcaster’s 지식 of magic grows, she can learn to cast 주문 in ways slightly different from the ways
            in which 주문 were originally designed or learned. Preparing and casting a spell in such a way is harder
            than normal but, thanks to 메타마법 특기, at least it is possible.&nbsp; 주문 modified by a 메타마법 feat
            use a spell slot higher than normal. This does not change 레벨 of the spell, so the DC for 내성 굴림 against
            it does not go up.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>마법사 and 신성 Spellcasters:</b><span>
              마법사 and 신성 spellcasters must prepare their 주문 in advance. During preparation, the character chooses
              which 주문 to prepare with 메타마법 특기(and thus which ones take up higher-레벨 spell slots than
              normal).</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>소서러와 음유시인:</b><span>
              소서러와 음유시인 choose 주문 as they cast them. They can choose when they cast their 주문 whether to
              apply their 메타마법 특기 to improve them. As with other spellcasters, the improved spell uses up a
              higher-레벨 spell slot. But because 소서러 or 음유시인 has not prepared the spell in a 메타마법 form in
              advance, he must apply 메타마법 feat on 감지. Therefore, such a character must also take more time to cast
              a 메타마법 spell (one enhanced by a 메타마법 feat) than he does to cast a regular spell. If the spell’s
              normal 시전 시간 is 1 action, casting a 메타마법 version is a full-round action for a 소서러 or 음유시인.
              (This isn’t the same as a 1-round 시전 시간.)</span>
          </p>
          <p>For a spell with a longer 시전 시간, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the spell.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Spontaneous Casting and 메타마법 특기: </b><span>A 사제 spontaneously casting a <i>cure </i>or
              <i>inflict </i>spell can cast a 메타마법 version of it instead. Extra
              time is also required in this case. Casting a 1-action 메타마법 spell spontaneously is a full-round
              action, and a spell with a longer 시전 시간 takes an extra full-round action to cast.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Effects of 메타마법 특기 on a Spell:</b><span>
              In all ways, a 메타마법 spell operates at its original spell 레벨, even though it is prepared and cast as
              a higher-레벨 spell. 내성 굴림 modifications are not changed unless stated otherwise in the feat
              묘사.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            The modifications made by these 특기 only apply to 주문 cast directly by the feat user. A spellcaster can’t
            use a 메타마법 feat to alter a spell being cast from a wand, scroll, or other device.
          </p>
          <p>
            메타마법 특기 that eliminate 구성요소 of a spell don’t eliminate 공격 of opportunity provoked by casting a
            spell while threatened. However, casting a spell modified by 빠른 주문 does not provoke an 공격 of
            opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            메타마법 특기 cannot be used with all 주문. See the specific 특기 설명 for 주문 that a particular feat can’t
            modify.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Multiple 메타마법 특기 on a Spell:</b><span>
              A spellcaster can apply multiple 메타마법 특기 to a single spell. Changes to its 레벨 are cumulative. You
              can’t apply the same 메타마법 feat more than once to a single spell.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>마법 아이템 and 메타마법 주문:</b><span>
              With the right item creation feat, you can store a 메타마법 version of a spell in a scroll, potion, or
              wand. 레벨 limits for potions and 마법막대 apply to the spell’s higher spell 레벨(after the application of
              메타마법 feat). A character doesn’t need 메타마법 feat to activate an item storing a 메타마법 version of a
              spell.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Counterspelling 메타마법 주문:</b><span>
              Whether or not a spell has been enhanced by a 메타마법 feat does not affect its vulnerability to
              counterspelling or its ability to counterspell another spell.</span>

            When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever
            drinks the potion is the target of the spell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate
            cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay
            the XP when creating the potion.

          <p>
            <i>리더십 Score: </i><span>A character’s base 리더십 score equals his 레벨 plus any 매력 수정치. In order to take into account
              negative 매력 수정치, this table allows for very low 리더십 scores, but the character must still be 6th
              레벨 or higher in order to gain 리더십 feat. Outside factors can affect a character’s 리더십 score, as
              detailed above.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Cohort 레벨: </i><span>The character can attract a cohort of up to this 레벨. Regardless of a character’s 리더십 score, he can
              only recruit a cohort who is two or more 레벨 lower than himself. The cohort should be equipped with gear
              appropriate for its 레벨. A character can try to attract a cohort of a particular race, class, and 성향.
              The cohort’s 성향 may not be opposed to the leader’s 성향 on either the law-vs-chaos or good-vs-evil axis,
              and the leader takes a 리더십 페널티 if he recruits a cohort of an 성향 different from his own.</span>
          </p>
          <p>Cohorts earn XP as follows:</p>
          <p>The cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party’s XP.</p>
          <p>
            Divide the cohort’s 레벨 by 레벨 of the PC with whom he or she is associated (the character with the 리더십
            feat who attracted the cohort).
          </p>
          <p>
            Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to the PC and add that number of experience points to the
            cohort’s total.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a 레벨 one lower than the associated PC’s character 레벨, the
            cohort does not gain the new 레벨—its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed attain the next 레벨.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Number of Followers by 레벨: </i><span>The character can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each 레벨. Followers are similar to
              cohorts, except they’re generally low-레벨 NPCs. Because they’re generally five or more 레벨 behind the
              character they follow, they’re rarely effective in 전투.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Followers don’t earn experience and thus don’t gain 레벨. However, when a character with 리더십 attains a
            new 레벨, the player consults the table above to determine if she has acquired more followers, some of which
            may be higher 레벨 than the existing followers. (You don’t consult the table to see if your cohort gains
            레벨, however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.)

              As a standard action, you may fire two arrows at a single opponent within 30 feet. Both arrows use the

            <b>Benefit:</b><span>
              You can alter a 폭발, emanation, line, or spread shaped spell to increase its 범위. Any numeric
              measurements of the spell’s 범위 increase by 100%.A widened spell uses up a spell slot three 레벨 higher
              than the spell’s actual 레벨.</span>
