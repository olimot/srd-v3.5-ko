        <div class="original-headline">WHAT IS A PLANE?</div>
        <p>
          이세계 of existence are different realities with interwoven connections. Except for rare linking points, each
          plane is effectively its own universe with its own natural laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          이세계 break down into a number of general types: 물질 세계, the Transitive 이세계, the Inner 이세계, the
          Outer 이세계, and the demiplanes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Material Plane: </b><span>물질 세계 tends to be the most Earthlike of all 이세계 and operates under the same set of natural laws that
            our own real world does. This is the default plane for most adventures.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Transitive 이세계:</b><span>
            These three 이세계 have one important common characteristic: Each is used to get from one place to another.
            영적 세계 is a conduit to all other 이세계, while 에테리얼 세계 and 어둠의 세계 both serve as means of
            transportation within 물질 세계 they’re connected to. These 이세계 have the strongest regular interaction
            with 물질 세계 and are often accessed by using various 주문. They have native inhabitants as well.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Inner 이세계:</b><span>
            These six 이세계 are manifestations of the basic building blocks of the universe. Each is made up of a
            single type of energy or element that overwhelms all others. The natives of a particular Inner Plane are
            made of the same energy or element as the plane itself.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Outer 이세계:</b><span>
            The deities live on the Outer 이세계, as do creatures such as celestials, 데몬, and 악마. Each of the Outer
            이세계 has an 성향, representing a particular moral or ethical outlook, and the natives of each plane tend
            to behave in agreement with that plane의 성향. The Outer 이세계 are also the final resting place of souls
            from 물질 세계, whether that final rest takes the form of calm introspection or eternal 천벌.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Demiplanes:</b><span>
            This catch-all category 엄폐 all extradimensional spaces that function like 이세계 but have measurable size
            and limited access. Other kinds of 이세계 are theoretically infinite in size, but a demiplane might be only
            a few hundred feet across.</span>

        <h3>이세계 속성</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">PLANAR TRAITS</div>
        <p>Each plane of existence has its own properties—the natural laws of its universe.</p>
        <p>이세계 속성 are broken down into a number of general 범위.</p>
        <p>All 이세계 have the following kinds of traits.</p>
        <p>
          <b>물리적 속성:</b><span>
            These traits determine the laws of physics and nature on the plane, including how gravity and time
            function.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>정령과 에너지 속성:</b><span> These traits determine the dominance of particular 정령 or energy forces.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>성향적 속성:</b><span>
            Just as characters may be lawful neutral or chaotic good, many 이세계 are tied to a particular moral or
            ethical outlook.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>마법적 속성:</b><span>
            Magic works differently from plane to plane, and 마법적 속성 set the boundaries for what it can and can’t
            do.</span>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="h3-3-physical-traits">
        <h3>물리적 속성</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">Physical Traits</div>
        <p>
          The two most important natural laws set by 물리적 속성 are how gravity works and how time passes. Other 물리적
          속성 pertain to the size and shape of a plane and how easily a plane의 nature can be altered.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Gravity:</b><span>
            The direction of gravity의 pull may be unusual, and it might even change directions within the plane
            itself.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Normal Gravity: </i><span>Most 이세계 have gravity similar to that of 물질 세계. The usual rules for 능력 점수, 운반 수용량, and
            encumbrance apply. Unless otherwise noted in a 묘사, it is assumed every plane has the normal gravity
            trait.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Heavy Gravity: </i><span>The gravity on a plane with this trait is much more intense than on 물질 세계. As a result, 균형, 등반,
            도약, 탑승, 수영, and 재주넘기 checks incur a –2 circumstance 페널티, as do all 명중 굴림. All item weights
            are effectively doubled, which might affect a character의 속도. Weapon 거리 are halved. A character의 근력
            and 민첩 scores are not affected. Characters who fall on a heavy gravity plane take 1d10 points of 피해 for
            each 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d10 points of 피해.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>빛 Gravity: </i><span>The gravity on a plane with this trait is less intense than on 물질 세계. As a result, creatures find that
            they can lift more, but their 이동 tend to be ungainly. Characters on a plane with 빛 gravity trait take a
            –2 circumstance 페널티 on 명중 굴림 and 균형, 탑승, 수영, and 재주넘기 checks. All items weigh half as much.
            Weapon 거리 double, and characters gain a +2 circumstance 보너스 on 등반 and 도약 checks.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          근력 and 민첩 don’t change as a result of 빛 gravity, but what you can do with such scores does change. These
          advantages apply to travelers from other 이세계 as well as natives.
        </p>
        <p>
          낙하 characters on a 빛 gravity plane take 1d4 points of 피해 for each 10 feet of the fall (maximum 20d4).
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>No Gravity: </i><span>Individuals on a plane with this trait merely 부유 in space, unless other resources are available to
            provide a direction for gravity의 pull.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Objective Directional Gravity: </i><span>근력 of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on 물질 세계, but the direction is not the
            traditional “down” toward the ground. It may be down toward any solid object, at an angle to the surface of
            the plane itself, or even upward.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, objective directional gravity may change from place to place. The direction of “down” may vary.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Subjective Directional Gravity: </i><span>근력 of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on 물질 세계, but each individual chooses the
            direction of gravity의 pull. Such a plane has no gravity for unattended objects and nonsentient creatures.
            This sort of 환경 can be very disorienting to the newcomer, but is common on “weightless” 이세계.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Characters on a plane with subjective directional gravity can 이동 normally along a solid surface by imagining
          “down” near their feet. If suspended in midair, a character “flies” by merely choosing a “down” direction and
          “낙하” that way. Under such a procedure, an individual “falls” 150 feet in the first round and 300 feet in
          each succeeding round. 이동 is straight-line only. In order to stop, one has to slow one의 이동 by changing
          the designated “down” direction (again, moving 150 feet in the new direction in the first round and 300 feet
          per round thereafter).
        </p>
        <p>
          It takes a DC 16 지혜 check to set a new direction of gravity as a free action; this check can be made once
          per round. Any character who fails this 지혜 check in successive rounds receives a +6 보너스 on subsequent
          checks until he or she succeeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>시간:</b><span>
            The rate of time의 passage can vary on different 이세계, though it remains constant within any particular
            plane. Time is always subjective for the viewer. The same subjectivity applies to various 이세계. Travelers
            may discover that they’ll pick up or lose time while moving among 이세계, but from their point of view, time
            always passes naturally.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Normal 시간: </i><span>This trait describes the way time passes on 물질 세계. One hour on a plane with normal time equals one hour
            on 물질 세계. Unless otherwise noted in a 묘사, every plane has the normal time trait.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Timeless: </i><span>On 이세계 with this trait, time still passes, but the effects of time are diminished. How the timeless
            trait can affect certain activities or 상태이상 such as hunger, thirst, aging, the effects of 독, and 치료
            varies from plane to plane.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The danger of a timeless plane is that once one leaves such a plane for one where time flows normally,
          상태이상 such as hunger and aging do occur retroactively.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Flowing 시간: </i><span>On some 이세계, time can flow faster or slower. One may travel to another plane, spend a year there, then
            return to 물질 세계 to find that only six seconds have elapsed. Everything on the plane returned to is only
            a few seconds older. But for that traveler and the items, 주문, and effects working on him, that year away
            was entirely real.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          When designating how time works on 이세계 with flowing time, put 물질 세계의 flow of time first, followed by
          the same flow in the other plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Erratic 시간: </i><span>Some 이세계 have time that slow down and 속도 up, so an individual may lose or gain time as he 이동
            between the two 이세계. The following is provided as an example.</span>
        </p>
        <div class="table-container">

              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>
        <p>To the denizens of such a plane, time flows naturally and the shift is unnoticed.</p>
        <p>
          If a plane is timeless with respect to magic, any spell cast with a noninstantaneous 지속시간 is permanent
          until dispelled.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Shape and Size:</b><span>
            이세계 come in a variety of sizes and shapes. Most 이세계 are infinite, or at least so large that they may
            as well be infinite.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Infinite: </i><span>이세계 with this trait go on forever, though they may have finite 구성요소 within them. Or they may consist
            of ongoing expanses in two directions, like a map that stretches out infinitely.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Finite Shape: </i><span>A plane with this trait has defined edges or borders. These borders may adjoin other 이세계 or hard, finite
            borders such as the edge of the world or a great wall. Demiplanes are often finite.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Self-Contained Shape: </i><span>On 이세계 with this trait, the borders wrap in on themselves, depositing the traveler on the other side of
            the map. A spherical plane is an example of a self-contained, finite plane, but there can be cubes, toruses,
            and flat 이세계 with magical edges that 순간이동 the traveler to an opposite edge when he crosses them.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Some demiplanes are self-contained.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Morphic Traits:</b><span>
            This trait measures how easily the basic nature of a plane can be changed. Some 이세계 are responsive to
            sentient thought, while others can be manipulated only by extremely powerful creatures. And some 이세계
            respond to physical or magical efforts.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Alterable Morphic: </i><span>On a plane with this trait, objects remain where they are (and what they are) unless affected by physical
            force or magic. You can change the immediate 환경 as a result of tangible effort.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Highly Morphic: </i><span>On a plane with this trait, features of the plane change so frequently that it의 difficult to keep a
            particular 범위 stable. Such 이세계 may react dramatically to specific 주문, sentient thought, or 의지의 힘.
            Others change for no reason.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Magically Morphic: </i><span>Specific 주문 can alter the basic material of a plane with this trait.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Divinely Morphic: </i><span>Specific unique beings (deities or similar great powers) have the ability to alter objects, creatures, and
            the landscape on 이세계 with this trait. Ordinary characters find these 이세계 similar to alterable 이세계
            in that they may be affected by 주문 and physical effort. But the deities may cause these 범위 to change
            instantly and dramatically, creating great kingdoms for themselves.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Static: </i><span>These 이세계 are unchanging. Visitors cannot affect living residents of the plane, nor objects that the
            denizens possess. Any 주문 that would affect those on the plane have no effect unless the plane의 static
            trait is somehow removed or suppressed. 주문 cast before entering a plane with the static trait remain in
            effect, however.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Even moving an unattended object within a static plane requires a DC 16 근력 check. Particularly heavy objects
          may be impossible to 이동.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Sentient: </i><span>These 이세계 are ones that respond to a single thought— that of the plane itself. Travelers would find the
            plane의 landscape changing as a result of what the plane thought of the travelers, either becoming more or
            less hospitable depending on its reaction.</span>

        <h3>정령과 에너지 속성</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">Elemental and Energy Traits</div>
        <p>
          Four basic elements and two types of energy together make up everything. The elements are earth, air, fire,
          and water. The types of energy are positive and negative.
        </p>
        <p>
          물질 세계 reflects a balancing of those elements and energies; all are found there. Each of the Inner 이세계
          is dominated by one element or type of energy. Other 이세계 may show off various aspects of these 정령 traits.
          Many 이세계 have no 정령 or energy traits; these traits are noted in a plane의 묘사 only when they are
          present.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Air-Dominant:</i><span>
            Mostly open space, 이세계 with this trait have just a few bits of floating stone or other elements. They
            usually have a breathable atmosphere, though such a plane may include clouds of acidic or toxic gas.
            Creatures of the earth subtype are uncomfortable on air-dominant 이세계 because they have little or no
            natural earth to connect with. They take no actual 피해, however.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Earth-Dominant:</i><span>
            이세계 with this trait are mostly solid. Travelers who arrive 달리기 the risk of 질식 if they don’t reach a
            cavern or other pocket within the earth. Worse yet, individuals without the ability to burrow are entombed
            in the earth and must dig their way out (5 feet per turn). Creatures of the air subtype are uncomfortable on
            earth dominant 이세계 because these 이세계 are tight and claustrophobic to them. But they suffer no
            inconvenience beyond having difficulty moving.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Fire-Dominant: </i><span>이세계 with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn without consuming their fuel source.
            Fire-dominant 이세계 are extremely hostile to Material Plane creatures, and those without 저항 or immunity
            to fire are soon immolated.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Unprotected wood, paper, cloth, and other flammable materials catch fire almost immediately, and those wearing
          unprotected flammable 의류 catch on fire. In addition, individuals take 3d10 points of fire 피해 every round
          they are on a fire-dominant plane. Creatures of the water subtype are extremely uncomfortable on fire-dominant
          이세계. Those that are made of water take double 피해 each round.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Water-Dominant:</i><span>
            이세계 with this trait are mostly liquid. Visitors who can’t breathe water or reach a pocket of air will
            likely drown. Creatures of the fire subtype are extremely uncomfortable on water-dominant 이세계. Those made
            of fire take 1d10 points of 피해 each round.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Positive-Dominant: </i><span>An abundance of life characterizes 이세계 with this trait. The two kinds of positive-dominant traits are
            minor positive-dominant and major positive-dominant. A minor positive-dominant plane is a riotous explosion
            of life in all its forms. Colors are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are louder, and sensations are more
            intense as a result of the positive energy swirling through the plane. All individuals in a
            positive-dominant plane gain 빠른 치료 2 as an extraordinary ability.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Major positive-dominant 이세계 go even further. A creature on a major positive-dominant plane must make a DC
          15 Fortitude save to avoid being blinded for 10 rounds by the brilliance of the surroundings. Simply being on
          the plane grants 빠른 치료 5 as an extraordinary ability. In addition, those at full 히트 포인트 gain 5
          additional 임시 히트 포인트 per round. These 임시 히트 포인트 fade 1d20 rounds after the creature leaves the
          major positive- dominant plane. However, a creature must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round that its 임시
          히트 포인트 exceed its normal hit point total. Failing 내성 굴림 results in the creature exploding in a riot
          of energy, killing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Negative-Dominant:</i><span>
            이세계 with this trait are vast, empty reaches that suck the life out of travelers who cross them. They tend
            to be lonely, haunted 이세계, drained of color and filled with 바람 bearing the soft moans of those who died
            within them. As with positive-dominant 이세계, negative-dominant 이세계 can be either minor or major. On
            minor negative-dominant 이세계, living creatures take 1d6 points of 피해 per round. At 0 히트 포인트 or
            lower, they crumble into ash.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Major negative-dominant 이세계 are even more severe. Each round, those within must make a DC 25 Fortitude save
          or gain a negative 레벨. A creature whose negative 레벨 equal its current 레벨 or 히트 다이스 is slain,
          becoming a 망령. The <i>죽음의 수호물 </i>spell protects a traveler from the
          피해 and 정령 흡수 of a negative-dominant plane.

        <h3>성향적 속성</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">Alignment Traits</div>
        <p>
          Some 이세계 have a predisposition to a certain 성향. Most of the inhabitants of these 이세계 also have the
          plane의 particular 성향, even powerful creatures such as deities. In addition, creatures of 성향 contrary to
          the plane have a tougher time dealing with its natives and situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          성향 trait of a plane affects social interactions there. Characters who follow other 성향 than most of the
          inhabitants do may find life more difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          성향적 속성 have multiple 구성요소. First are the moral (good or evil) and ethical (lawful or chaotic)
          구성요소; a plane can have either a moral component, an ethical component, or one of each. Second, the
          specific 성향 trait indicates whether each moral or ethical component is mildly or strongly evident.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Good-Aligned/Evil-Aligned: </i><span>These 이세계 have chosen a side in the battle of good versus evil. No plane can be both good-aligned and
            evil-aligned.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Law-Aligned/Chaos-Aligned:</i><span>
            Law versus chaos is the key struggle for these 이세계 and their residents. No plane can be both law-aligned
            and chaos-aligned.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Each part of the moral/ethical 성향 trait has a descriptor, either “mildly” or “strongly,” to show how
          powerful the influence of 성향 is on the plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Mildly Aligned: </i><span>Creatures who have an 성향 opposite that of a mildly aligned plane take a –2 circumstance 페널티 on all
            매력-based checks.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Strongly Aligned:</i><span>
            On 이세계 that are strongly aligned, a –2 circumstance 페널티 applies on all 매력-based checks made by all
            creatures not of the plane의 성향. In addition, the –2 페널티 affects all 지능-based and 지혜-based checks,
            too.</span>
        </p>
        <p>페널티 for the moral and ethical 구성요소 of 성향 trait do stack.</p>
        <p>
          <i>Neutral-Aligned:</i><span> A mildly neutral-aligned plane does not apply a circumstance 페널티 to anyone.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          물질 세계 is considered mildly neutral-aligned, though it may contain high 집중 of evil or good, law or chaos
          in places.
        </p>
        <p>
          A strongly neutral-aligned plane would stand in opposition to all other moral and ethical principles: good,
          evil, law, and chaos. Such a plane may be more concerned with 균형 of 성향 than with accommodating and
          accepting alternate points of view. In the same fashion as for other strongly aligned 이세계, strongly
          neutral-aligned 이세계 apply a –2 circumstance 페널티 to 지능-, 지혜-, or 매력-based checks by any creature
          that isn’t neutral. 페널티 is applied twice (once for law/chaos, and once for good/evil), so neutral good,
          neutral evil, lawful neutral, and chaotic neutral creatures take a –2 페널티 and lawful good, chaotic good,
          chaotic evil, and lawful evil creatures take a –4 페널티.

          A plane의 magic trait describes how magic works on the plane compared to how it works on 물질 세계. Particular
          locations on a plane (such as those under the direct control of deities) may be pockets where a different
          magic trait applies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Normal Magic:</i><span>
            This magic trait means that all 주문 and supernatural 능력 function as written. Unless otherwise noted in a

        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Wild Magic:</i><span>
            On a plane with the wild magic trait 주문 and 유사주문 능력 function in radically different and sometimes
            dangerous ways. Any spell or 유사주문 ability used on a wild magic plane has a chance to go awry. The
            caster must make a 레벨 check (DC 15 + 레벨 of the spell or effect) for the magic to function normally. For
            유사주문 능력, use 레벨 or HD of the creature employing the ability for 시전자 레벨 check and 레벨 of the
            유사주문 ability to set the DC for 시전자 레벨 check. Failure on this check means that something strange
            happens; roll d% and consult the following table.</span>

          <i>Impeded Magic:</i><span>
            Particular 주문 and 유사주문 능력 are more difficult to cast on 이세계 with this trait, often because the
            nature of the plane interferes with the spell.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          To cast an impeded spell, the caster must make a 주문학 check (DC 20 + 레벨 of the spell). If the check fails,
          the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check succeeds, the
          spell functions normally.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Enhanced Magic:</i><span>
            Particular 주문 and 유사주문 능력 are easier to use or more powerful in effect on 이세계 with this trait
            than they are on 물질 세계.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Natives of a plane with the enhanced magic trait are aware of which 주문 and 유사주문 능력 are enhanced, but
          planar travelers may have to discover this on their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a spell is enhanced, certain 메타마법 특기 can be applied to it without changing the spell slot required or
          시전 시간. Spellcasters on the plane are considered to have that feat or 특기 for 목적 of applying them to
          that spell. Spellcasters native to the plane must gain the feat or 특기 normally if they want to use them on
          other 이세계 as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Limited Magic:</i><span>

            qualifications.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Magic can be limited to effects from certain 학파 or subschools, to effects with certain descriptors, or to
          effects of a certain 레벨(or any combination of these qualities). 주문 and 유사주문 능력 that don’t meet the
          qualifications simply don’t work.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>죽음 Magic: </i><span>These 이세계 have no magic at all. A plane with 죽음 magic trait functions in all respects like an
            <i>대마법 보호장 </i>spell. 점술 주문 cannot detect subjects within a 죽음
            magic plane, nor can a spellcaster use <i>순간이동 </i>or another spell to
            이동 in or out. The only exception to the “no magic” rule is permanent planar portals, which still function
            normally.</span>

        <p>
          <b>Separate 이세계:</b><span>
            Two 이세계 that are separate do not overlap or directly connect to each other. They are like planets in
            different orbits. The only way to get from one separate plane to the other is to go through a third
            plane.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Coterminous 이세계:</b><span>
            이세계 that touch at specific points are coterminous. Where they touch, a connection exists, and travelers
            can leave one reality behind and enter the other.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Coexistent 이세계:</b><span>
            If a link between two 이세계 can be created at any point, the two 이세계 are coexistent. These 이세계
            overlap each other completely. A coexistent plane can be reached from anywhere on the plane it overlaps.
            When moving on a coexistent plane, it is often possible to see into or interact with the plane it coexists
            with.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Layered 이세계</p>
        <p>
          Infinities may be broken into smaller infinities, and 이세계 into smaller, related 이세계. These layers are
          effectively separate 이세계 of existence, and each layer can have its own 이세계 속성. Layers are connected to
          each other through a variety of planar 관문, natural vortices, paths, and shifting borders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Access to a layered plane from elsewhere usually happens on a specific layer: the first layer of the plane,
          which can be either the top layer or the bottom layer, depending on the specific plane. Most fixed access
          points (such as portals and natural vortices) reach this layer, which makes it the gateway for other layers of
          the plane. The <i>이세계 전이 </i>spell also deposits the spellcaster on the
          first layer of the plane.

            에테리얼 세계, but it appears muted and indistinct, its colors blurring into each other and its edges

            The only exceptions are 주문 and 유사주문 능력 that have the force descriptor and 회피술 주문 that affect
            ethereal beings. Spellcasters on 물질 세계 must have some way to detect foes on 에테리얼 세계 before
            targeting them with force-based 주문, of course. While it의 possible to hit ethereal enemies with a force
            spell cast on 물질 세계, the reverse isn’t possible. No magical 공격 cross from 에테리얼 세계 to 물질 세계,
            including force 공격.

          <h3>어둠의 세계</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">PLANE OF SHADOW</div>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 12px">어둠의 세계 is a dimly lit dimension that is both coterminous to and coexistent with 물질 세계. It
              overlaps the Material </span><span>Plane much as 에테리얼 세계 does, so a planar traveler can use 어둠의 세계 to 엄폐 great distances
              quickly.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            어둠의 세계 is also coterminous to other 이세계. With the right spell, a character can use 어둠의 세계 to
            visit other realities.
          </p>
          <p>
            어둠의 세계 is a world of black and white; color itself has been bleached from 환경. It is otherwise appears
            similar to 물질 세계.
          </p>
          <p>Despite the lack of 빛 sources, various plants, animals, and humanoids call 어둠의 세계 home.</p>
          <p>
            어둠의 세계 is magically morphic, and parts continually flow onto other 이세계. As a result, creating a
            precise map of the plane is next to impossible, despite the presence of landmarks.
          </p>
          <p>어둠의 세계 has the following traits.</p>
          <p>
            • Magically morphic. Certain 주문 modify the base material of 어둠의 세계. The utility and power of these
            주문 within 어둠의 세계 make them particularly useful for explorers and natives alike.
          </p>
          <p>• Mildly neutral-aligned.</p>
          <p>
            • Enhanced magic. 주문 with 어둠 descriptor are enhanced on 어둠의 세계. Such 주문 are cast as though they
            were prepared with 주문 최대화 feat, though they don’t require the higher spell slots.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, specific 주문 become more powerful on 어둠의 세계.
            <i>어둠 창조술 </i>and
            <i>어둠 환기 </i>주문 are 30% as powerful as 소환술 and 강신술 they
            따라쟁이(as opposed to 20%). <i>상급 어둠 창조술 </i>and
            <i>상급 어둠 환기 </i>are 70% as powerful (not 60%), and a
            <i>그림자술 </i>spell conjures at 90% of the power of the original (not
            80%).
          </p>
          <p>
            • Impeded magic. 주문 that use or generate 빛 or fire may fizzle when cast on 어둠의 세계. A spellcaster
            attempting a spell with 빛 or fire descriptor must succeed on a 주문학 check (DC 20 + 레벨 of the spell).
            주문 that produce 빛 are less effective in general, because all 빛 sources have their 거리 halved on 어둠의
            세계.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the dark nature of 어둠의 세계, 주문 that produce, use, or manipulate 암흑 are unaffected by the
            plane.

            영적 세계 is the space between 이세계. When a character 이동 through an interplanar portal or projects her

            영적 세계 is a great, endless sphere of clear silvery sky, both above and below. Occasional bits of solid

            functioning when the traveler leaves 영적 세계.
          </p>
          <p>• Mildly neutral-aligned.</p>
          <p>
            • Enhanced magic. All 주문 and 유사주문 능력 used within 영적 세계 may be employed as if they were
            improved by 빠른 주문 feat. Already quickened 주문 and 유사주문 능력 are unaffected, as are 주문 from 마법
            아이템. 주문 so quickened are still prepared and cast at their unmodified 레벨. As with 빠른 주문 feat, only
            one quickened spell can be cast per round.
