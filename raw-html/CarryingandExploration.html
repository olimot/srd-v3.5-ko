Encumbrance comes in two parts: encumbrance by armor and encumbrance by total weight.</p><p><strong>갑옷으로 인한 과적상태:</strong> A character’s armor defines his or her maximum Dexterity bonus to AC, armor check penalty, speed, and running speed. Unless your character is weak or carrying a lot of gear, that’s all you need to know. The extra gear your character carries won’t slow him or her down any more than the armor already does.</p><p>If your character is weak or carrying a lot of gear, however, then you’ll need to calculate encumbrance by weight. Doing so is most important when your character is trying to carry some heavy object.</p><p><strong>무게:</strong> If you want to determine whether your character’s gear is heavy enough to slow him or her down more than the armor already does, total the weight of all the character’s items, including armor, weapons, and gear. Compare this total to the character’s Strength on Table: Carrying Capacity. Depending on how the weight compares to the character’s carrying capacity, he or she may be carrying a light, medium, or heavy load. Like armor, a character’s load affects his or her maximum Dexterity bonus to AC, carries a check penalty (which works like an armor check penalty), reduces the character’s speed, and affects how fast the character can run, as shown on Table: Carrying Loads. A medium or heavy load counts as medium or heavy armor for the purpose of abilities or skills that are restricted by armor. Carrying a light load does not encumber a character.</p><p>If your character is wearing armor, use the worse figure (from armor or from load) for each category. Do not stack the penalties.</p><p><strong>들어올리기 및 잡아끌기:</strong> A character can lift as much as his or her maximum load over his or her head.</p><p>A character can lift as much as double his or her maximum load off the ground, but he or she can only stagger around with it. While overloaded in this way, the character loses any Dexterity bonus to AC and can move only 5 feet per round (as a full-round action).</p><p>A character can generally push or drag along the ground as much as five times his or her maximum load. Favorable conditions can double these numbers, and bad circumstances can reduce them to one-half or less.</p><p><strong>더 큰 생명체, 더 작은 생명체:</strong> The figures on Table: Carrying Capacity are for Medium bipedal creatures. A larger bipedal creature can carry more weight depending on its size category, as follows: Large x2, Huge x4, Gargantuan x8, Colossal x16. A smaller creature can carry less weight depending on its size category, as follows: Small x3/4, Tiny x1/2, Diminutive x1/4, Fine x1/8.</p><p>Quadrupeds can carry heavier loads than characters can. Instead of the multipliers given above, multiply the value corresponding to the creature’s Strength score from Table: Carrying Capacity by the appropriate modifier, as follows: Fine x1/4, Diminutive x1/2, Tiny x3/4, Small x1, Medium x1-1/2, Large x3, Huge x6, Gargantuan x12, Colossal x24.</p><p><strong>굉장한 근력:</strong> For Strength scores not shown on Table: Carrying Capacity, find the Strength score between 20 and 29 that has the same number in the “ones” digit as the creature’s Strength score does and multiply the numbers in that for by 4 for every ten points the creature’s strength is above the score for that row.</p><div class="table-container"><table><caption>Table: Carrying Capacity</caption><tbody><tr><th style="min-width: 7.95em;">근력 점수</th><th style="min-width: 7.2em;">Light

id="h1-3-movement"><h1>이동</h1><p>There are three movement scales, as follows.</p><p><span style="font-size: 16px;">• </span>Tactical, for combat, measured in feet (or squares) per round.</p><p><span style="font-size: 16px;">• </span>Local, for exploring an area, measured in feet per minute.</p><p><span style="font-size: 16px;">• </span>Overland, for getting from place to place, measured in miles per hour or miles per day.</p><p><strong>이동 모드:</strong> While moving at the different movement scales, creatures generally walk, hustle, or run.</p><p><em>걷기:</em> A walk represents unhurried but purposeful movement at 3 miles per hour for an unencumbered human.</p><p><em>빠른 걸음:</em> A hustle is a jog at about 6 miles per hour for an unencumbered human. A character moving his or her speed twice in a single round, or moving that speed in the same round that he or she performs a standard action or another move action is hustling when he or she moves.</p><p><em>달리기 (x3):</em> Moving three times speed is a running pace for a character in heavy armor. It represents about 9 miles per hour for a human in full plate.</p><p><i>Run (x</i><i>4):</i> Moving four times speed is a running pace for a character in light, medium, or no armor. It represents about 12 miles per hour for an unencumbered human, or 8 miles per hour for a human in chainmail.</p><section id="h2-4-tactical-movement"><h2>전략적 이동</h2><p>Use tactical movement for combat. Characters generally don’t walk during combat—they hustle or run. A character who moves his or her speed and takes some action is hustling for about half the round and doing something else the other half.</p><p><strong>험난한 이동:</strong> Difficult terrain, obstacles, or poor visibility can hamper movement. When movement is hampered, each square moved into usually counts as two squares, effectively reducing the distance that a character can cover in a move. </p><p>If more than one condition applies, multiply together all additional costs that apply. (This is a specific exception to the normal rule for doubling) </p><p>In some situations, your movement may be so hampered that you don’t have sufficient speed even to move 5 feet (1 square). In such a case, you may use a full-round action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any direction, even diagonally. Even though this looks like a 5-foot step, it’s not, and thus it provokes attacks of opportunity normally. (You can’t take advantage of this rule to move through impassable terrain or to move when all movement is prohibited to you.)</p><p>You can’t run or charge through any square that would hamper your movement.</p></section><section id="h2-5-local-movement"><h2>지역 내 이동</h2><p>Characters exploring an area use local movement, measured in feet per minute.</p><p><strong>걷기:</strong> A character can walk without a problem on the local scale.</p><p><strong>빠른 걸음:</strong> A character can hustle without a problem on the local scale. See Overland Movement, below, for movement measured in miles per hour.</p><p><strong>달리기:</strong> A character with a Constitution score of 9 or higher can run for a minute without a problem. Generally, a character can run for a minute or two before having to rest for a minute</p></section><section id="h2-6-overland-movement"><h2>지역간 이동</h2><p>Characters covering long distances cross-country use overland movement. Overland movement is measured in miles per hour or miles per day. A day represents 8 hours of actual travel time. For rowed watercraft, a day represents 10 hours of rowing. For a sailing ship, it represents 24 hours.</p><p><strong>걷기:</strong> A character can walk 8 hours in a day of travel without a problem. Walking for longer than that can wear him or her out (see Forced March, below).</p><p><strong>빠른 걸음:</strong> A character can hustle for 1 hour without a problem. Hustling for a second hour in between sleep cycles deals 1 point of nonlethal damage, and each additional hour deals twice the damage taken during the previous hour of hustling. A character who takes any nonlethal damage from hustling becomes fatigued.</p><p>A fatigued character can’t run or charge and takes a penalty of –2 to Strength and Dexterity. Eliminating the nonlethal damage also eliminates the fatigue.</p><p><strong>달리기:</strong> A character can’t run for an extended period of time.</p><p>Attempts to run and rest in cycles effectively work out to a hustle.</p><p><strong>지형:</strong> The terrain through which a character travels affects how much distance he or she can cover in an hour or a day (see Table: Terrain and Overland Movement). A highway is a straight, major, paved road. A road is typically a dirt track. A trail is like a road, except that it allows only single-file travel and does not benefit a party traveling with vehicles. Trackless terrain is a wild area with no paths.</p><p><strong>강행군:</strong> In a day of normal walking, a character walks for 8 hours. The rest of the daylight time is spent making and breaking camp, resting, and eating.</p><p>A character can walk for more than 8 hours in a day by making a forced march. For each hour of marching beyond 8 hours, a Constitution check (DC 10, +2 per extra hour) is required. If the check fails, the character takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. A character who takes any nonlethal damage from a forced march becomes fatigued. Eliminating the nonlethal damage also eliminates the fatigue. It’s possible for a character to march into unconsciousness by pushing himself too hard.</p><p><strong>탈것으로 이동:</strong> A mount bearing a rider can move at a hustle. The damage it takes when doing so, however, is lethal damage, not nonlethal damage. The creature can also be ridden in a forced march, but its Constitution checks automatically fail, and, again, the damage it takes is lethal damage. Mounts also become fatigued when they take any damage from hustling or forced marches.</p><p>See Table: Mounts and Vehicles for mounted speeds and speeds for vehicles pulled by draft animals.</p><p><strong>수상 이동:</strong> See Table: Mounts and Vehicles for speeds for water vehicles.</p><div class="table-container"><table><caption>Table: Movement and

If the pursuer wins, it catches the fleeing creature. </p><p>Sometimes a chase occurs overland and could last all day, with the two sides only occasionally getting glimpses of each other at a distance. In the case of a long chase, an opposed Constitution check made by all parties determines which can keep pace the longest. If the creature being chased rolls the highest, it gets away. If not, the chaser runs down its prey, outlasting it with stamina.</p></section><section id="h2-10-moving-around-in-squares"><h2>정사각형 간 이동</h2><p>In general, when the characters aren’t engaged in round-by-round combat, they should be able to move anywhere and in any manner that you can imagine real people could. A 5-foot square, for instance, can hold several characters; they just can’t all fight effectively in that small space. The rules for movement are important for combat, but outside combat they can impose unnecessary hindrances on character activities.</p></section></section><section id="h1-11-exploration"><h1>탐험</h1><section id="h2-12-vision-and-light"><h2>시야와 빛</h2><p>Dwarves and half-orcs have darkvision, but everyone else needs light to see by. See Table: Light Sources and Illumination for the radius that a light source illuminates and how long it lasts.</p><p>In an area of bright light, all characters can see clearly. A creature can’t hide in an area of bright light unless it is invisible or has cover.</p><p>In an area of shadowy illumination, a character can see dimly. Creatures within this area have concealment relative to that character. A creature in an area of shadowy illumination can make a Hide check to conceal itself.</p><p>In areas of darkness, creatures without darkvision are effectively blinded. In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded creature has a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have total concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, takes a –2 penalty to AC, moves at half speed, and takes a –4 penalty on Search checks and most Strength and Dexterity-based skill checks.</p><p>Characters with low-light vision (elves, gnomes, and half-elves) can see objects twice as far away as the given radius. Double the effective radius of bright light and of shadowy illumination for such characters.</p><p>Characters with darkvision (dwarves and half-orcs) can see lit areas normally as well as dark areas within 60 feet. A creature can’t hide within 60 feet of a character with darkvision unless it is invisible or has cover.</p><div class="table-container"><table><caption>Table: Light Sources and Illumination</caption><tbody><tr><th style="min-width: 12.45em;">물체</th><th style="min-width: 6.6em;">Bright</th><th style="min-width: 6.375em;">Shadowy</th><th style="min-width: 5.775em;">지속시간</th></tr><tr><td>양초</td><td>n/a<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td><td>5 ft.</td><td>1 hr.</td></tr><tr><td>영원히 불타는 횃불</td><td>20 ft.</td><td>40 ft.</td><td>영구</td></tr><tr><td>램프, 평범함</td><td>15 ft.</td><td>30 ft.</td><td>6 hr./pint</td></tr><tr><td>랜턴, 방향성<sup style="font-weight: 700;">2</sup></td><td>60-ft. 원뿔형</td><td>120-ft. 원뿔형</td><td>6 hr./pint</td></tr><tr><td>랜턴, 지붕있음</td><td>30 ft.</td><td>60 ft.</td><td>6 hr./pint</td></tr><tr><td>태양막대</td><td>30 ft.</td><td>60 ft.</td><td>6 hr.</td></tr><tr><td>횃불</td><td>20 ft.</td><td>40 ft.</td><td>1 hr.</td></tr><tr><th>주문</th><th>Bright</th><th>Shadowy</th><th>지속시간</th></tr><tr><td style="font-style: italic;">지속적인 불꽃</td><td>20 ft.</td><td>40 ft.</td><td>영구</td></tr><tr><td><i>춤추는 빛</i>(횃불)</td><td>20 ft.

Smashing an object is a lot like sundering a weapon or shield, except that your attack roll is opposed by the object’s AC. Generally, you can smash an object only with a bludgeoning or slashing weapon.</p><p><strong>방어도:</strong> Objects are easier to hit than creatures because they usually don’t move, but many are tough enough to shrug off some damage from each blow. An object’s Armor Class is equal to 10 + its size modifier + its Dexterity modifier. An inanimate object has not only a Dexterity of 0 (–5 penalty to AC), but also an additional –2 penalty to its AC. Furthermore, if you take a full-round action to line up a shot, you get an automatic hit with a melee weapon and a +5 bonus on attack rolls with a ranged weapon.</p><p><strong>경도:</strong> Each object has hardness—a number that represents how well it resists damage. Whenever an object takes damage, subtract its hardness from the damage. Only damage in excess of its hardness is deducted from the object’s hit points (see Table: Common Armor, Weapon, and Shield Hardness and Hit Points; Table: Substance Hardness and Hit Points; and Table: Object Hardness and Hit Points).</p><p><strong>히트 포인트:</strong> An object’s hit point total depends on what it is made of and how big it is (see Table: Common Armor, Weapon, and Shield Hardness and Hit Points; Table: Substance Hardness and Hit Points; and Table: Object Hardness and Hit Points). When an object’s hit points reach 0, it’s ruined.</p><p>Very large objects have separate hit point totals for different sections.</p><p><em>에너지 공격:</em> Acid and sonic attacks deal damage to most objects just as they do to creatures; roll damage and apply it normally after a successful hit. Electricity and fire attacks deal half damage to most objects; divide the damage dealt by 2 before applying the hardness. Cold attacks deal one-quarter damage to most objects; divide the damage dealt by 4 before applying the hardness.</p><p><em>원거리 무기 피해:</em> Objects take half damage from ranged weapons (unless the weapon is a siege engine or something similar). Divide the damage dealt by 2 before applying the object’s hardness.</p><p><em>비효율적인 무기:</em> Certain weapons just can’t effectively deal damage to certain objects.</p><p><i>Immunities</i>: Objects are immune to nonlethal damage and to critical hits.</p><p>Even animated objects, which are otherwise considered creatures, have these immunities because they are constructs.</p><p><em>마법 갑옷, 방패, 무기:</em> Each +1 of enhancement bonus adds 2 to the hardness of armor, a weapon, or a shield and +10 to the item’s hit points.</p><p><em>특정 공격에 대한 취약성:</em> Certain attacks are especially successful against some objects. In such cases, attacks deal double their normal damage and may ignore the object’s hardness.</p><p><em>피해 받은 물체:</em> A damaged object remains fully functional until the item’s hit points are reduced to 0, at which point it is destroyed.</p><p>Damaged (but not destroyed) objects can be repaired with the Craft skill.</p><p><strong>내성 굴림:</strong> Nonmagical, unattended items never make saving throws. They are considered to have failed their saving throws, so they always are affected by spells. An item attended by a character (being grasped, touched, or worn) makes saving throws as the character (that is, using the character’s saving throw bonus).</p><p>Magic items always get saving throws. A magic item’s Fortitude, Reflex, and Will save bonuses are equal to 2 + one-half its caster level. An attended magic item either makes saving throws as its owner or uses its own saving throw bonus, whichever is better.</p><p><em>살아 움직이는 물체:</em> Animated objects count as creatures for purposes of determining their Armor Class (do not treat them as inanimate objects).</p></section><section id="h5-15-breaking-items"><h5>아이템 부수기</h5><p>When a character tries to break something with sudden force rather than by dealing damage, use a Strength check (rather than an attack roll and damage roll, as with the sunder special attack) to see whether he or she succeeds. The DC depends more on the construction of the item than on the material.</p><p>If an item has lost half or more of its hit points, the DC to break it drops by 2.</p><p>Larger and smaller creatures get size bonuses and size penalties on Strength checks to break open doors as follows: Fine –16, Diminutive –12, Tiny –8, Small –4, Large +4, Huge +8, Gargantuan +12, Colossal +16.</p><p>A crowbar or portable ram improves a character’s chance of breaking open a door.</p><div class="table-container"><table><caption>Table: Common Armor, Weapon, and Shield Hardness and Hit Points</caption><tbody><tr><th style="min-width: 17.625em;">무기 or 방패</th><th style="min-width: 5.4em;">경도</th><th style="min-width: 8.1em;">HP<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></th></tr><tr><td>Light blade</td><td>10</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>한손 blade</td><td>10</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>양손 blade</td><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Light metal-hafted 무기</td><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>한손 metal-hafted 무기</td><td>10</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Light hafted 무기</td><td>5</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>한손 hafted 무기</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>양손 hafted 무기</td><td>5</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>투사 무기</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>갑옷</td><td>특수<sup style="font-weight: 700;">2</sup></td><td>갑옷 보너스 x 5</td></tr><tr><td>버클러</td><td>10</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Light wooden 방패</td><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy wooden 방패</td><td>5</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Light steel 방패</td><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy steel 방패</td><td>10</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>장방패</td><td>5</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><div>1 The hp value given is for 중간 갑옷, 무기, 방패.</div><div>Divide by 2 for each 크기 category of 아이템 smaller than 중간, multiply it by 2 for each 크기 category larger than 중간.</div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">2 Varies by 물질; see Table: Substance 경도 및 히트 포인트.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="table-container"><table><caption>Table: Substance Hardness and Hit Points</caption><tbody><tr><th>Substance</th><th>경도</th><th>히트 포인트</th></tr><tr><td>Paper or cloth</td><td>0</td><td>2/inch of thickness</td></tr><tr><td>밧줄</td><td>0</td><td>2/inch of thickness</td></tr><tr><td>Glass</td><td>1</td><td>1/inch of thickness</td></tr><tr><td>Ice</td><td>0</td><td>3/inch of thickness</td></tr><tr><td>Leather or 숨기</td><td>2</td><td>5/inch of thickness</td></tr><tr><td>Wood</td><td>5</td><td>10/inch of thickness</td></tr><tr><td>돌</td><td>8</td><td>15/inch of thickness</td></tr><tr><td>철 or steel</td><td>10</td><td>30/inch of thickness</td></tr><tr><td>미스랄</td><td>15</td><td>30/inch of thickness</td></tr><tr><td>아다만틴</td><td>20</td><td>40/inch of thickness</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="table-container"><table><caption>Table: Size and Armor Class of Objects</caption><tbody><tr><th style="min-width: 8.175em;">크기</th><th style="min-width: 8.175em;">AC 수정치</th></tr><tr><td>초대형</td><td>–8</td></tr><tr><td>거대형</td><td>–4</td></tr><tr><td>특대형</td><td>–2</td></tr><tr><td>대형</td><td>–1</td></tr><tr><td>중간</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>소형</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>특소형</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>초소형</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>극초소형</td><td>+8</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="table-container"><table><caption>Table: Object Hardness and Hit Points</caption><tbody><tr><th>물체</th><th>경도</th><th>히트 포인트</th><th>Break DC</th></tr><tr><td>밧줄 (1 inch diam.)</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>단순 wooden door</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>소형 chest</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>선 wooden door</td><td>5</td><td>15</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>전리품 chest</td><td>5</td><td>15</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Strong wooden door</td><td>5</td><td>20</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Masonry 벽 (1 ft. thick)</td><td>8</td><td>90</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Hewn 돌 (3 ft. thick)</td><td>8</td><td>540</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>사슬</td><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>수갑</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>명품 수갑</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>철 door (2 in. thick)</td><td>10</td><td>60</td><td>28</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="table-container"><table><caption>Table: DCs to Break or Burst Items</caption><tbody><tr><th>근력 판정 to:</th><th>DC</th></tr><tr><td>Break down 단순 door</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Break down 선 door</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Break down strong door</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>폭발 밧줄 bonds</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Bend 철 bars</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Break down barred door</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>폭발 사슬 bonds</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Break down 철 door</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><th>Condition</th><th>DC 보정<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></th></tr><tr><td style="font-style: italic;">문 잠그기</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td style="font-style: italic;">비전 자물쇠</td><td>+10</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">1 If both apply, use the larger number.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section></section></section></body></html>
