        <p>
          You 이동 objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on the version selected, the spell can
          provide a gentle, sustained force, 공연 a variety of 전투 maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Sustained Force: </i><span>A sustained force 이동 an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per 시전자 레벨(maximum 375 pounds at 15th
            레벨) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful
            Will save or with 주문 저항.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          This version of the spell can last 1 round per 시전자 레벨, but it ends if you cease 집중. The weight can be
          moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your 거리. The spell
          ends if the object is forced beyond 거리. If you cease 집중 for any reason, the object falls or stops.
        </p>
        <p>
          An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled,
          a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You
          might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require 지능 checks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>전투 Maneuver: </i><span>Alternatively, once per round, you can use <i>염동력 </i>to 공연 a 황소
            쇄도, 무장해제, 드잡이(including pin), or 넘어뜨리기. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they
            don’t provoke 기회 공격, you use your 시전자 레벨 in place of your 기본 공격 보너스(for 무장해제 and
            드잡이), you use your 지능 수정치 (if a 마법사) or 매력 수정치 (if a 소서러) in place of your 근력 or 민첩
            수정치, and a failed attempt doesn’t allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as for 무장해제 or
            넘어뜨리기). No save is allowed against these attempts, but 주문 저항 applies normally. This version of the
            spell can last 1 round per 시전자 레벨, but it ends if you cease 집중.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Violent Thrust: </i><span>Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per
            시전자 레벨(maximum 15) that are within 거리 and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within
            10 feet per 레벨 of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per 시전자 레벨(maximum
            375 pounds at 15th 레벨).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          You must succeed on 명중 굴림(one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your
          기본 공격 보너스 + your 지능 수정치 (if a 마법사) or 매력 수정치 (if a 소서러). 무기 cause standard 피해 (with
          no 근력 보너스; note that arrows or 화살복제 deal 피해 as daggers of their size when used in this manner).
          Other objects cause 피해 ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of 피해
          per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).
        </p>
        <p>
          Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will 내성 굴림
          (and 주문 저항) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a
          telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes 피해 as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6
          points).

          This spell functions like <i>탄성의 구, </i>with the addition that the
          creatures or objects inside the globe are nearly weightless. Anything contained within an
          <i>염동력의 구 </i>weighs only one-sixteenth of its normal weight. You can
          telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that normally weighs 5,000 pounds or less. The telekinetic control
          extends from you out to medium 거리(100 feet + 10 feet per 시전자 레벨) after the sphere has succeeded in
          encapsulating its contents.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can 이동 objects or creatures in the sphere that weigh a total of 5,000 pounds or less by concentrating on
          the sphere. You can begin moving a sphere in the round after casting the spell. If you concentrate on doing so
          (a standard action), you can 이동 the sphere as much as 30 feet in a round. If you cease concentrating, the
          sphere does not 이동 in that round (if on a 레벨 surface) or descends at its 낙하 rate (if aloft) until it
          reaches a 레벨 surface, or the spell의 지속시간 expires, or you begin concentrating again. If you cease
          concentrating (voluntarily or due to failing a 집중 check), you can resume concentrating on your next turn or
          any later turn during the spell의 지속시간.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to cause 피해 to the contents
          of the sphere.
        </p>
        <p>You can 이동 the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it.</p>

          You forge a 텔레파시 결속 among yourself and a number of willing creatures, each of which must have an 지능
          score of 3 or higher. Each creature included in the link is linked to all the others. The creatures can
          communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence is
          established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from
          one plane to another).

          If desired, you may leave yourself out of 텔레파시 결속 forged. This decision must be made at the time of

          This spell instantly 운송수단 you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per 시전자
          레벨. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed
          your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or
          objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three 시전자 레벨. A Large creature counts
          as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be
          transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with
          you. As with all 주문 where 거리 is personal and the target is you, you need not make a 내성 굴림, nor is 주문
          저항 applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive 내성 굴림 and 주문
          저항.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image,
          the more likely the teleportation works. 범위 of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more
          hazardous or even impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult 순간이동 table. Refer to the following
          information for definitions of the terms on the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Familiarity: </i><span>“Very familiar” is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully”
            is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you’ve been there often, or you have used
            other means (such as <i>염탐</i>) to study the place for at least one hour.
            “Seen casually” is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar.
            “Viewed once” is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          “False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar
          location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you.
          When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%,
          since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.
        </p>
        <p><i>On Target: </i><span>You appear where you want to be.</span></p>
        <p>
          <i>Off Target: </i><span>You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is
            1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Similar 범위: </i><span>You wind up in an 범위 that의 visually or thematically similar to the target 범위.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within 거리. If no such 범위 exists within the spell의
          거리, the spell simply fails instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Mishap: </i><span>You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 1d10 points of 피해, and
            you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes
            up, the characters take more 피해 and must reroll.</span>

          Once you designate the destination for the circle, you can’t change it. The spell fails if you attempt to set

          You create an unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any color you desire around yourself. Half the sphere
          projects above the ground, and the lower hemisphere passes through the ground. As many as nine other Medium
          creatures can fit into the field with you; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it.
          However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          The temperature inside the hut is 70° F if the exterior temperature is between 0° and 100° F. An exterior
          temperature below 0° or above 100° lowers or raises the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis. The
          hut also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and 모래폭풍. The hut withstands any
          wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind 속도) or 상급 force destroys it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interior of the hut is a hemisphere. You can illuminate it dimly upon 명령 or extinguish 빛 as desired.
          Although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within. Missiles, 무기, and most
          spell effects can pass through the hut without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from
          outside the hut (they have total 은폐).

          This spell turns natural, uncut or unworked rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud. Magical stone is not
          affected by the spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. A creature unable to 부유, 비행, or
          otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its 속도 to 5 feet and causing a
          –2 페널티 on 명중 굴림 and AC. Brush thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to 등반 on top of it.
          Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through 범위 at a 속도 of 5 feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          If <i>바위를 진흙으로 변성 </i>is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or
          tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet. 낙하 mud and the ensuing
          cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning 피해 to anyone caught directly beneath 범위, or half 피해 to those who
          succeed on Reflex 내성 굴림.
        </p>
        <p>
          Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since
          <i>바위를 진흙으로 변성 </i>can’t affect worked stone and doesn’t reach deep
          enough to undermine such buildings’ foundations. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon
          foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mud remains until a successful <i>마법 무효화 </i>or
          <i>진흙을 바위로 변성 </i>spell restores its substance—but not necessarily
          its form. Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact time depends on exposure
          to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.

        <p>
          <i>영혼의 덫 </i><span>forces a creature의 life force (and its material body) into a gem. The gem holds the trapped entity
            indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to
            reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane it can be required to 공연 a
            service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is
            broken.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways.</p>
        <p>
          <i>Spell Completion: </i><span>First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a
            regular spell at the subject. This allows 주문 저항(if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect. If the
            creature의 이름 is spoken as well, any 주문 저항 is ignored and the save DC increases by 2. If the save or
            주문 저항 is successful, the gem 분쇄.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>트리거 Object: </i><span>The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a 트리거 object inscribed
            with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature의 soul in the trap. To use this method, both
            the creature의 이름 and 트리거 word must be inscribed on 트리거 object when the gem is enspelled. A
            <i>공감 </i>spell can also be placed on 트리거 object. As soon as the
            subject picks up or accepts 트리거 object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without
            the benefit of 주문 저항 or a save.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Material Component: </i><span>Before the actual casting of <i>영혼의 덫, </i>you must procure a gem of
            at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die possessed by the creature to be trapped. If the gem is not
            valuable enough, it 분쇄 when the entrapment is attempted. (While creatures have no concept of 레벨 or 히트
            다이스 as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this
            value can change over time as creatures gain more 히트 다이스.)</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Focus (트리거 Object Only): </i><span>If 트리거 object method is used, a special 트리거 object, prepared as described above, is needed.</span>

          By means of this spell, you are able to assume the form of a Large living tree or shrub or a Large 죽음 tree
          trunk with a small number of limbs. The closest inspection cannot reveal that the tree in question is actually
          a magically concealed creature. To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a
          <i>마법 감지 </i>spell reveals a faint 변환술 on the tree. While in tree
          form, you can observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form, and your 히트
          포인트 and save 보너스 remain unaffected. You gain a +10 자연 갑옷 보너스 to AC but have an effective 민첩
          score of 0 and a 속도 of 0 feet. You are immune to critical hits while in tree form. All 의류 and gear carried

          You gain the ability to enter trees and 이동 from inside one tree to inside another tree. The first tree you
          enter and all others you enter must be of the same kind, must be living, and must have girth at least equal to

          You can, at your option, remain within a tree without transporting yourself, but you are forced out when the

          This spell functions like <i>시체 되살리기, </i>except that you can resurrect
          a creature that has been 죽음 for as long as 10 years per 시전자 레벨. This spell can even bring back
          creatures whose bodies have been destroyed, provided that you unambiguously 식별 the deceased in some fashion

          You confer on the subject the ability to see all things as they actually are. The subject sees through normal
          and magical 암흑, notices secret 문 hidden by magic, sees the exact locations of creatures or objects under
          <i>흐릿함 </i>or <i>변위 </i>effects, sees
          invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through 환영술, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed,
          or transmuted things. Further, the subject can focus its 시야 to see into 에테리얼 세계(but not into

          throughout the entire site, regardless of its normal 지속시간 and 범위 or effect. You may designate whether
          the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that share your faith or 성향, or creatures that adhere to
          another faith or 성향. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced
          simply by casting <i>반신성화 </i>again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spell effects that may be tied to an <i>unhallowed </i>site include
          <i>보조, 파멸, 축복, 공포 유발, 암흑, 햇살, 죽음의 수호물, 깊은 암흑, 마법 감지, 선 감지, 차원의 닻, 거짓말

        </p>
        <p>
          First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection 보너스 to AC and a +4 저항 보너스 on 내성 굴림. Unlike the
          effect of <i>선 방어 마법</i>, this benefit applies against all 공격, not
          just against 공격 by good creatures.
        </p>
        <p>Second, a warded creature gains 주문 저항 25 against good 주문 and 주문 cast by good creatures.</p>
        <p>
          Third, 회피술 blocks possession and mental influence, just as
          <i>선 방어 마법 </i>does.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, if a good creature succeeds on a melee 공격 against a warded creature, the offending attacker takes

        <p>Only good and neutral (not evil) creatures are harmed by the spell.</p>
        <p>
          The spell deals 1d8 points of 피해 per two 시전자 레벨(maximum 5d8) to a good creature (or 1d6 per 시전자
          레벨, maximum 10d6, to a good outsider) and causes it to be sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save
          reduces 피해 to half and negates the sickened effect. The effects cannot be negated by
          <i>질병 제거 </i>or <i>치료, </i>but
          <i>저주 제거 </i>is effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          The spell deals only half 피해 to creatures who are neither evil nor good, and they are not sickened. Such a
          creature can reduce 피해 in half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful Will save.

        <p>
          An <i>보이지 않는 하인 </i>is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that
          공연 simple tasks at your 명령. It can 달리기 and fetch things, open unstuck 문, and hold chairs, as well as
          clean and mend. The servant can 공연 only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and
          over again if told to do so as long as you remain within 거리. It can open only normal 문, drawers, lids, and
          the like. It has an effective 근력 score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can 트리거
          함정 and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure
          plates and other devices. It can’t 공연 any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that
          requires a check using a skill that can’t be used untrained. Its 속도 is 15 feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The servant cannot 공격 in any way; it is never allowed an 명중 굴림. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates
          if it takes 6 points of 피해 from 범위 공격. (It gets no 내성 굴림 against 공격.) If you attempt to send it
          beyond the spell의 거리(measured from your current position), the servant ceases to exist.

          This spell functions like <i>전설의 지식, </i>except that it works more
          quickly but produces some strain on you. You pose a question about some person, place, or object, then cast
          the spell. If the person or object is at hand or if you are in the place in question, you receive a 시야 about
          it by succeeding on a 시전자 레벨 check (1d20 +1 per 시전자 레벨; maximum +25) against DC 20. If only detailed
          information on the person, place, or object is known, the DC is 25, and the information gained is incomplete.

          An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected
          by you, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire 피해 to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points
          of fire 피해 to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this 피해 when it appears and on your
          turn each round to all creatures in 범위. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire 피해 +1 point of fire
          피해 per 시전자 레벨(maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double 피해 to undead

          A <i>힘의 장벽 </i>spell creates an invisible 힘의 장벽. The wall cannot

          This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected. A
          <i>얼음 장벽 </i>cannot form in an 범위 occupied by physical objects or
          creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is
          created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that
          the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a <i>얼음 장벽, </i>and it deals
          full 피해 to the wall (instead of the normal half 피해 taken by objects). Suddenly melting a
          <i>얼음 장벽 </i>creates a great cloud of steamy 안개 that lasts for 10
          minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Ice Plane: </i><span>A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per 시전자 레벨. It 엄폐 up to a
            10-foot-square 범위 per 시전자 레벨(so a 10th-레벨 마법사 can create a 얼음 장벽 100 feet long and 10 feet
            high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not
            exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical
            wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two
            opposite sides.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 히트 포인트 per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically.
          A section of wall whose 히트 포인트 drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with
          a single 공격, the DC for 근력 check is 15 + 시전자 레벨.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it
          (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold 피해 +1 point per 시전자 레벨(no

          You cause a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The wall inserts itself into any surrounding
          nonliving material if its 범위 is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the
          same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to
          fit the available space.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <i>강철 장벽 </i>is 1 inch thick per four 시전자 레벨. You can double the
          wall의 범위 by halving its thickness. Each 5- foot square of the wall has 30 히트 포인트 per inch of thickness
          and hardness 10. A section of wall whose 히트 포인트 drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break
          through the wall with a single 공격, the DC for 근력 check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface,
          so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in
          either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall
          randomly. A creature must make a DC 40 근력 check to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee 낙하 wall
          may do so by making successful Reflex 내성 굴림. Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of
          피해. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.
        </p>
        <p>Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena.</p>

          This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. A
          <i>암석 장벽 </i>is 1 inch thick per four 시전자 레벨 and composed of up to
          one 5-foot square per 레벨. You can double the wall의 범위 by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be
          conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike a <i>강철 장벽, </i>you can create a
          <i>암석 장벽 </i>in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be
          vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing
          stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20
          feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell의 범위 by half. The wall can
          be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing 범위.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a <i>분해 </i>spell
          or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15 히트 포인트 per inch
          of thickness and hardness 8. A section of wall whose 히트 포인트 drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to
          break through the wall with a single 공격, the DC for 근력 check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a
          <i>암석 장벽</i>, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.
          Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex 내성 굴림.

          A <i>가시 장벽 </i>spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled
          brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human의 finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to 이동
          through a <i>가시 장벽 </i>takes slashing 피해 per round of 이동 equal to 25
          minus the creature의 AC. 민첩 and 회피 보너스 to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an
          방어도 of 25 or higher, without considering 민첩 and 회피 보너스, take no 피해 from contact with the wall.)
        </p>
        <p>
          You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of
          10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your 시전자 레벨. This has no effect on 피해 dealt by the thorns, but
          any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a 근력 check as a full-round action. For every
          5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature 이동 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal
          land 속도). Of course, moving or attempting to 이동 through the thorns incurs 피해 as described above. A
          creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more 피해.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any creature within 범위 of the spell when it is cast takes 피해 as if it had moved into the wall and is
          caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends.
          Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown 범위 unhindered can pass through a
          <i>가시 장벽 </i>at normal 속도 without taking 피해.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <i>가시 장벽 </i>can be breached by slow work with edged 무기. Chopping
          away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot 해악 the
          barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite its appearance, a <i>가시 장벽 </i>is not actually a living plant,
          and thus is unaffected by 주문 that affect plants.

          You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and 근력. A warped door
          springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a 근력 check to open, at your option). A boat or ship springs a
          leak. Warped ranged 무기 are useless. A warped melee weapon causes a –4 페널티 on 명중 굴림.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per 시전자 레벨. A Medium object counts as two

          object as thirty-two.

          Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell, straightening wood

          the other hand, does no good in repairing a warped item.

          You can combine multiple consecutive <i>나무 왜곡 </i>주문 to warp (or
          unwarp) an object that is too large for you to warp with a single spell.

          <i>거미줄 </i><span>creates a many-layered 광역 of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands
            are similar to spider 거미줄 but far larger and tougher. These 광역 must be anchored to two or more solid
            and diametrically opposed points or else 거미줄 collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught
            within a <i>거미줄 </i>become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a
            creature in a 거미줄 won’t cause you to become entangled.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone in the effect의 범위 when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the
          creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal for being
          entangled (see below). If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can’t 이동 from its space, but can
          break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 근력 check or a DC 25 탈출 전문가 check. Once loose (either
          by making the initial Reflex save or a later 근력 check or 탈출 전문가 check), a creature remains entangled,
          but may 이동 through the <i>거미줄 </i>very slowly. Each round devoted to
          moving allows the creature to make a new 근력 check or 탈출 전문가 check. The creature 이동 5 feet for each
          full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have at least 5 feet of 거미줄 between you and an opponent, it provides 엄폐. If you have at least 20
          feet of 거미줄 between you, it provides total 엄폐.
        </p>
        <p>
          The strands of a <i>거미줄 </i>spell are flammable. A magic
          <i>flaming sword </i>can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away
          cobwebs. Any fire can set 거미줄 alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round. All creatures within flaming
          거미줄 take 2d4 points of fire 피해 from the flames.

          round on your turn with no save allowed. You may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever
          you 소원, depositing the hapless souls wherever the cyclone happens to be when they are released.

          You send a 통보 or sound on the wind to a designated 감지. The
          <i>바람의 속삭임 </i>travels to a specific location within 거리 that is
          familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A
          <i>바람의 속삭임 </i>is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches
          the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet 통보 or other sound. Note that 통보 is delivered regardless
          of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can prepare the spell to bear a 통보 of no more than twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other
          sounds for 1 round, or merely have the <i>바람의 속삭임 </i>seem to be a
          faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the <i>바람의 속삭임 </i>to
          이동 as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until 통보 is delivered. As with
          <i>마법의 입, 바람의 속삭임 </i>cannot 말하기 verbal 구성요소, use 명령
          words, or activate magical effects.

        <p>
          You alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor (as the
          <i>기체 형태 </i>spell) and 이동 through the air, possibly at great 속도. You
          can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally, a <i>wind walker </i>flies at a 속도 of 10 feet with perfect
          maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a
          <i>wind walker </i>along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor
          maneuverability. <i>Wind walkers </i>are not invisible but rather appear
          misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, 안개, vapors,
          or the like.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <i>wind walker </i>can regain its physical form as desired and later resume
          the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward 지속시간 of the
          spell (as does any time spent in physical form). As noted above, you can dismiss the spell, and you can even
          dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the last minute of the spell의 지속시간, a <i>wind walker </i>in cloud
          form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it
          소원. This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end.

          An invisible vertical curtain of wind appears. It is 2 feet thick and of considerable 근력. It is a roaring
          blast sufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an 독수리, or tear papers and similar materials from
          unsuspecting hands. (A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.) Tiny and Small
          flying creatures cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and cloth garments 비행 upward when caught
          in a <i>바람 장벽. </i>Arrows and 화살복제 are deflected upward and miss,
          while any other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall has a 30% miss chance. (A 거인-thrown boulder, a
          siege engine projectile, and other massive ranged 무기 are not affected.) Gases, most gaseous 브레스 무기, and
          creatures in 기체 형태 cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures).

          <i>소원 </i><span>is the mightiest spell a 마법사 or 소서러 can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can 현실 변경 to better
            suit you.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Even <i>소원</i>, however, has its limits.</p>
        <p>A <i>소원 </i>can produce any one of the following effects.</p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 16px">• </span><span>Duplicate any 마법사 or 소서러 spell of 8th 레벨 or lower, provided the spell is not of a 학파 prohibited

        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 16px">• </span><span>Undo the harmful effects of many other 주문, such as <i>기아스/임무 </i>or
            <i>광기</i>.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 16px">• </span><span>Create a nonmagical item of up to 25,000 gp in value.</span></p>

            <i>소원 </i>주문 cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to
            +5 inherent 보너스 to an ability score (two 소원 for a +2 inherent 보너스, three for a +3 inherent 보너스,
            and so on). Inherent 보너스 are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled.
            <i>Note: </i>An inherent 보너스 may not exceed +5 for a single ability
            score, and inherent 보너스 to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 16px">• </span><span>Remove injuries and afflictions. A single <i>소원 </i>can 보조 one
            creature per 시전자 레벨, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could
            치료 all 피해 you and your companions have taken, or remove all 독 effects from everyone in the party, but
            not do both with the same <i>소원</i>. A

          <span style="font-size: 16px">• </span><span>Revive 죽음. A <i>소원 </i>can bring a 죽음 creature back to life by
            duplicating a <i>부활 </i>spell. A
            <i>소원 </i>can revive a 죽음 creature whose body has been destroyed, but
            the task takes two <i>소원, </i>one to recreate the body and another to
            infuse the body with life again. A <i>소원 </i>cannot prevent a character

        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 16px">• </span><span>Undo misfortune. A <i>소원 </i>can undo a single recent event. The
            <i>소원 </i>forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round
            (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a
            <i>소원 </i>could undo an opponent의 successful save, a foe의 successful
            critical hit (either 명중 굴림 or the critical roll), a friend의 failed save, and so on. The reroll,
            however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate
            the effect, and 주문 저항(if any) applies.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          You may try to use a <i>소원 </i>to produce 상급 effects than these, but
          doing so is dangerous. (The <i>소원 </i>may pervert your intent into a
          literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.)
        </p>
        <p>Duplicated 주문 allow 내성 굴림 and 주문 저항 as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-레벨 주문).</p>
        <p>
          <i>Material Component: </i><span>When a <i>소원 </i>duplicates a spell with a material component that costs
            more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>XP Cost: </i><span>The minimum XP cost for casting <i>소원 </i>is 5,000 XP. When a
            <i>소원 </i>duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP
            or that cost, whichever is more. When a <i>소원 </i>creates or improves a
            magic item, you must pay twice the normal XP cost for crafting or improving the item, plus an additional
            5,000 XP.</span>

          creature의 Will save (or 주문 저항) prevents items in its possession from being teleported. Unattended,
          nonmagical objects receive no 내성 굴림.

          By casting <i>침묵의 영역</i>, you manipulate sound waves in your immediate
          vicinity so that you and those within the spell의 범위 can converse normally, yet no one outside can hear your
          voices or any other noises from within, including language-dependent or sonic spell effects. This effect is
          centered on you and 이동 with you. Anyone who enters the zone immediately becomes subject to its effects, but
          those who leave are no longer affected. Note, however, that a successful 감지 check to read lips can still
          reveal what의 said inside a <i>침묵의 영역.</i>

          Creatures within the emanation 범위(or those who enter it) can’t 말하기 any deliberate and intentional lies.
          Each potentially affected creature is allowed a save to avoid the effects when the spell is cast or when the
          creature first enters the emanation 범위. Affected creatures are aware of this 부여술. Therefore, they may
          avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they may be evasive as long as
          they remain within the boundaries of the truth. Creatures who leave 범위 are free to 말하기 as they choose.
