      <div class="original-headline">PSIONIC POWERS OVERVIEW</div>
      <p>
        사이오닉 파워 spring from sentient minds. Even an undead creature or a being that has no physical form can
        create a reserve of inner 근력 necessary to manifest powers, as long as it has an 지능 score of at least 1.
        Vermin possessed of a hive mind ability are an exception to this rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        A psionic power is a one-time psionic effect. Psionic characters and creatures need not prepare their powers for
        use ahead of time. They either have sufficient 파워 포인트 to manifest a power or they do not.
      </p>
      <p>
        A power is manifested when a psionic character pays its power point cost. Some 사이오닉 생명체 automatically
        manifest powers, called 유사사이오닉 능력, without paying a power point cost. Other creatures pay 파워 포인트 to
        manifest their powers, just as characters do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each power has a specific effect. A power known to a psionic character can be used whenever he or she has 파워
        포인트 to pay for it.
      </p>
      <section id="h3-1-manifesting-powers">
        <h3>파워 구현</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">MANIFESTING POWERS</div>
        <p>
          Psionic characters and creatures manifest powers. Whether they cost 파워 포인트 when manifest by a psionic
          character, or are manifested as 유사사이오닉 능력, powers’ effects remain the same. The process of manifesting
          a power is akin to casting a spell, but with significant differences.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="h3-2-choosing-a-power">
        <h3>파워 선택하기</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">CHOOSING A POWER</div>
        <p>
          First you must choose which power to manifest. You can select any power you know, provided you are capable of
          파워 구현 of that 레벨 or higher. To manifest a power, you must pay 파워 포인트, which count against your
          daily total. You can manifest the same power multiple times if you have points left to pay for it.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="h3-3-concentration">
        <h3>집중</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">CONCENTRATION</div>
        <p>
          To manifest a power, you must concentrate. If something threatens to interrupt your 집중 while you’re
          manifesting a power, you must succeed on a 집중 check or lose 파워 포인트 without manifesting the power.
          The more distracting the interruption and the higher 레벨 of the power that you are trying to manifest,
          the higher the DC. (Higher-레벨 powers require more mental effort.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">Injury:</span
          ><span>
            Getting hurt or being affected by hostile 사이오닉 while trying to manifest a power can break your 집중 and
            파멸 a power. If you take 피해 while trying to manifest a power, you must make a 집중 check (DC 10 + points
            of 피해 taken + 레벨 of the power you’re manifesting). The interrupting event strikes during
            manifestation if it occurs between when you start and when you complete manifesting a power (for a power
            with a 구현 시간 of 1 round or longer) or if it comes in response to your manifesting the power (such as an
            공격 of opportunity provoked by the manifesting of the power or a contingent 공격 from a readied
            action).</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are taking continuous 피해 half 피해 is considered to take place while you are manifesting a power.
          You must make a 집중 check (DC 10 + 1/2 피해 that the continuous source last dealt + 레벨 of the power
          you’re manifesting).
        </p>
        <p>
          If the last 피해 dealt was the last 피해 that the effect could deal then 피해 is over, and it does not
          주의산만 you.
        </p>
        <p>Repeated 피해 does not count as continuous 피해.</p>

            If you are affected by a power while attempting to manifest a power of your own, you must make a 집중 check
            or lose the power you are manifesting. If the power affecting you deals 피해, 집중 DC is 10 + points of
            피해 + 레벨 of the power you’re manifesting. If the power interferes with you or 주의산만 you in some
            other way, 집중 DC is the power’s save DC + 레벨 of the power you’re manifesting. For a power with
            no 내성 굴림, it’s the DC that the power’s 내성 굴림 would have if a save were allowed.</span

        <h3>구현자 레벨</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">MANIFESTER LEVEL</div>
        <p>
          The variables of a power’s effect often depend on its 구현자 레벨, which is equal to your psionic class 레벨.
          A power that can be augmented for additional effect is also limited by your 구현자 레벨(you can’t spend more
          파워 포인트 on a power than your 구현자 레벨). See Augment under 설명 문구, below.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can manifest a power at a lower 구현자 레벨 than normal, but 구현자 레벨 must be high enough for you
          to manifest the power in question, and all 레벨-dependent features must be based on the same 구현자 레벨.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event that a class feature or other special ability provides an adjustment to your 구현자 레벨, this
          adjustment applies not only to all effects based on 구현자 레벨(such as 거리, 지속시간, and augmentation
          potential) but also to your 구현자 레벨 check to overcome your target’s 파워 저항 and to 구현자 레벨 used
          in dispel checks (both the dispel check and the DC of the check).

        <h3>파워 실패</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">POWER FAILURE</div>
        <p>
          If you try to manifest a power in 상태이상 where the characteristics of the power (거리, 범위, and so on)
          cannot be made to conform, the manifestation fails and 파워 포인트 are wasted.
        </p>
        <p>Powers also fail if your 집중 is broken (see 집중, above).</p>

        <h3>파워의 결과</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">THE POWER’S RESULT</div>
        <p>
          Once you know which creatures (or objects or 범위) are affected, and whether those creatures have made
          successful 내성 굴림(if any were allowed), you can apply whatever results a power entails.

          <span style="font-weight: 700">공격:</span
          ><span>
            Some powers refer to attacking. All offensive 전투 actions, even those that don’t 피해 opponents, such as
            무장해제 and 황소 쇄도, are considered 공격. All powers that opponents can resist with 내성 굴림, that deal
            피해, or that otherwise 해악 or hamper subjects are considered 공격.
            <span style="font-style: italic">영적 구조물 </span>and similar powers are not considered 공격 because the
            powers themselves don’t 해악 anyone.</span

          <span style="font-weight: 700">보너스 Types:</span
          ><span>
            Many powers give creatures 보너스 to 능력 점수, 방어도, 공격, and other attributes. Each 보너스 has a type
            that indicates how the power grants 보너스. The important aspect of 보너스 types is that two 보너스 of
            the same type don’t generally stack. With the exception of 회피 보너스, most circumstance 보너스, and
            racial 보너스, only the better 보너스 works (see 사이오닉과 마법 효과 조합하기, below). The same principle
            applies to 페널티—a character taking two or more 페널티 of the same type applies only the worst
            one.</span

          <span style="font-weight: 700">Bringing Back 죽음:</span

            Of all 사이오닉 파워, only <span style="font-style: italic">현실 수정 </span>has the ability to restore
            slain characters to life. When a living creature dies, its soul departs the body, leaves 물질 세계, travels
            through 영적 세계, and goes to abide on the plane where the creature’s deity resides. If the creature did
            not worship a deity, its soul departs to the plane corresponding to its 성향. Bringing someone back from the
            죽음 means retrieving his or her soul and returning it to his or her body.</span

            >The passage from life to death and back again is a wrenching journey for a being’s soul. Consequently, any
            creature brought back to life usually loses one 레벨 of experience. The character’s new experience point
            total is midway between the minimum needed for his or her new (reduced) 레벨 and the minimum needed for the
            next one. If the character was 1 레벨 at the time of death, he or she loses 2 points of 건강 instead of
            losing a 레벨. This 레벨 손실 or 건강 loss cannot be repaired by any mortal means, even 주문
            <span style="font-style: italic">소원 </span>or <span style="font-style: italic">기적</span>. A revived
            character can regain a lost 레벨 by earning XP through further adventuring. A revived character who was 1

        <h3>사이오닉과 마법 효과 조합하기</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">COMBINING PSIONIC AND MAGICAL EFFECTS</div>
        <p>
          The default rule for the interaction of 사이오닉 and magic is simple: Powers interact with 주문 and 주문
          interact with powers in the same way a spell or normal spell-like ability interacts with another spell or
          spell-like ability. This is known as 사이오닉–magic transparency.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">사이오닉–Magic Transparency:</span
          ><span>

              >, </span
            >주문, spell-like 능력, and 마법 아이템 that could potentially affect 사이오닉 do affect 사이오닉.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>When the rule about 사이오닉–magic transparency is in effect, it has the following ramifications.</p>
        <p>
          주문 저항 is effective against powers, using the same mechanics. Likewise, 파워 저항 is effective against
          주문, using the same mechanics as 주문 저항. If a creature has one kind of 저항, it is assumed to have the
          other. (The effects have similar ends despite having been brought about by different means.)
        </p>
        <p>
          All 주문 that 마법 무효화 have equal effect against powers of the same 레벨 using the same mechanics, and vice
          versa.
        </p>
        <p>
          The spell <span style="font-style: italic">마법 감지 </span>detects powers, their number, and their 근력 and
          location within 3 rounds (though a 사이크래프트 check is necessary to 식별 분야 of the psionic aura).
        </p>
        <p>죽음 magic 범위 are also 죽음 사이오닉 범위.</p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">Multiple Effects:</span
          ><span>
            Powers or psionic effects usually work as described no matter how many other powers, psionic effects, 주문,
            or magical effects happen to be operating in the same 범위 or on the same recipient. Except in special
            cases, a power does not affect the way another power or spell operates. Whenever a power has a specific
            effect on other powers or 주문, the power 묘사 explains the effect (and vice versa for 주문 that affect
            powers). Several other general rules apply when powers, 주문, magical effects, or psionic effects operate in
            the same place.</span

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">Stacking Effects:</span
          ><span>
            Powers that provide 보너스 or 페널티 on 명중 굴림, 피해 rolls, 내성 굴림, and other attributes usually
            do not stack with themselves. More generally, two 보너스 of the same type don’t stack even if they come
            from different powers, or one from a power and one from a spell. You use whichever 보너스 gives you the
            better result.

          <span style="font-style: italic">Different 보너스 Types</span

            >: 보너스 or 페널티 from two different powers, or a power and a spell, stack if the effects are of
            different types. 보너스 that isn’t named (just a “+2 보너스” rather than a “+2 insight 보너스”) stacks with
            any 보너스.</span

            >: In cases when two or more similar or identical effects are operating in the same 범위 or on the same
            target, but at different 근력, only the best one applies. If one power or spell is dispelled or its 지속시간

            controls that don’t remove the recipient’s ability to act usually do not interfere with one another, though
            one may modify another. If a creature is under the control of two or more creatures, it tends to obey each
            to the best of its ability, and to the extent of the control each effect allows. If the controlled creature
            receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the competing controllers must make opposed 매력 checks to

          manipulations require natural talent and personal meditation. A psionic character’s 레벨 limits the number of
          파워 포인트 available to manifest powers. A psionic character’s relevant high score might allow him to gain
          extra 파워 포인트. He can manifest the same power more than once, but each manifestation subtracts 파워 포인트
          from his daily limit. Manifesting a power is an arduous mental task. To do so, a psionic character must have a
          핵심 능력 score of at least 10 + the power’s 레벨.

            To regain used daily 파워 포인트, a psionic character must have a clear mind. To clear his mind, he must
            first 수면 for 8 hours. The character does not have to slumber for every minute of the time, but he must
            refrain from 이동, 전투, 파워 구현, skill use, conversation, or any other demanding physical or mental task
            during the rest period. If his rest is interrupted, each interruption adds 1 hour to the total amount of
            time he has to rest to clear his mind, and he must have at least 1 hour of rest immediately prior to
            regaining lost 파워 포인트. If the character does not need to 수면 for some reason, he still must have 8
            hours of restful calm before regaining 파워 포인트.</span

            <div class="original-headline">Manifest an Unknown Power from Another’s Powers Known</div>
            <p>
              A psionic character can attempt to manifest a power from a source other than his own 지식(usually a power
              stone or another willing psionic character). To do so, the character must first make contact (a process
              similar to addressing a power stone, requiring a 사이크래프트 check against a DC of 15+ 레벨 of the
              power to be manifested). A psionic character can make contact with only a willing psionic character or
              creature (unconscious creatures are considered willing, but not psionic characters under the effects of
              other immobilizing 상태이상). Characters who can’t use 파워스톤 for any reason are also banned from
              attempting to manifest powers from 지식 of other psionic characters. Mental contact requires 1 full
              round of physical contact, which can provoke 기회 공격. Once contact is achieved, the character becomes
              aware of all the powers stored in the power stone or all the powers the other character knows up to the
              highest 레벨 of power the contactor knows himself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, the psionic character must choose one of the powers and make a second 사이크래프트 check (DC 15 +
              the power’s 레벨) to see if he understands it. If the power is not on his class list, he automatically
              fails this check.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon successfully making contact with another willing psionic character or creature and learning what he
              can of one power in particular, the character can immediately attempt to manifest that power even if he
              doesn’t know it (and assuming he has 파워 포인트 left for the day). He can attempt to manifest the power
              normally on his next turn, and he succeeds if he makes one additional 사이크래프트 check (DC 15 + the
              power’s 레벨). He retains the ability to manifest the selected power for only 1 round. If he doesn’t
              manifest the power, fails 사이크래프트 check, or manifests a different power, he loses his chance to
              manifest that power for the day.

          사이오닉 생명체 can create psionic effects without having 레벨 in a psionic class (although they can take a
          psionic class to further enhance their 능력); such creatures have 사이오닉 하위 유형.
        </p>
        <p>
          Characters using 도르제, <span style="font-style: italic">인식의 결정, </span>and other 사이오닉 아이템 can
          also create psionic effects. In addition to existing spell-like and supernatural 능력, creatures can also have
          유사사이오닉 능력. (사이오닉 생명체 may also have extraordinary and natural 능력.)

          ><span>
            The manifestation of powers by a psionic character is considered a psi-like ability, as is the manifestation
            of powers by creatures without a psionic class (creatures with 사이오닉 하위 유형, also simply called
            사이오닉 생명체). Usually, a psionic creature’s psi-like ability works just like the power of that 이름. A
            few 유사사이오닉 능력 are unique; these are explained in the text where they are described.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          유사사이오닉 능력 have no verbal, somatic, or material 구성요소, nor do they require a focus or have an XP
          cost (even if the equivalent power has an XP cost). The user activates them mentally. 갑옷 never affects a
          psi-like ability’s use. A psi-like ability has a 구현 시간 of 1 standard action unless noted otherwise in the
          ability 묘사. In all other ways, a psi-like ability functions just like a power. However, a psionic creature
          does not have to pay a psi-like ability’s power point cost.

        <p>
          유사사이오닉 능력 are subject to 파워 저항 and to being dispelled by

          A psionic cascade is a loss of control over psionic 능력. Using 파워 포인트 becomes dangerous for a character
          infected by cascade flu, once the incubation period has 달리기 its course. Every time an afflicted character
          manifests a power, she must make a DC 16 집중 check. On a failed check, a psionic cascade is triggered. The
          power operates normally, but during the following round, without the character’s volition, two additional
          powers she knows manifest randomly, and their power cost is deducted from the character’s reserve. During the
          next round, three additional powers manifest, and so on, until all the psionic character’s 파워 포인트 are
          drained. Powers with a 거리 of personal or touch always affect the diseased character. For other powers that
          affect targets, roll d%: On a 01–50 result, the power affects the diseased character, and 51–00 indicates that
          the power targets other creatures in the vicinity. 사이오닉 생명체(those that manifest their powers without
          paying points) cascade until all the powers they know have manifested at least twice.

          As with any 질병, a psionic character who is injured or attacked by a creature carrying a 질병 or parasite, or
          who otherwise has contact with contaminated material, must make an immediate Fortitude save. On a success, the
          질병 fails to gain a foothold. On a failure, the character takes 피해(or incurs the specified effect) after
          the incubation period. Once per day afterward, the afflicted character must make a successful Fortitude save
          to avoid repeating 피해. Two successful 내성 굴림 in a row indicate she has fought off 질병.

          Cerebral parasites are tiny organisms, undetectable to normal sight. An afflicted character may not even know
          he carries the parasites—until he discovers he has fewer 파워 포인트 for the day than expected. 사이오닉
          생명체 with cerebral parasites are limited to using each of their known powers only once per day (instead of

            number of 파워 포인트 equal to the cost of that power. If two or more powers fit these criteria, the
            manifester decides which one becomes inaccessible. The lost power becomes available again as soon the
            negative 레벨 is removed, providing the manifester is capable of using it at that time. Lost 파워 포인트

            A power that takes 1 round to manifest requires a full-round action. It comes into effect just before the

            power is completed.
          </p>
          <p>
            A power that takes 1 minute to manifest comes into effect just before your turn 1 minute later (and for each
            of those 10 rounds, you are manifesting a power as a full-round action, as noted above for 1-round 구현
            시간). These actions must be consecutive and uninterrupted, or 파워 포인트 are lost and the power fails.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you use a power that takes 1 round or longer to manifest, you must continue 집중 from the current
            round to just before your turn in the next round (at least). If you lose 집중 before 구현 시간 is
            complete, 파워 포인트 are lost and the power fails.

              action can be performed at any time—even if it’s not your turn. Using an immediate action on your turn is
              the same as using a swift action, and counts as your swift action for that turn. You cannot use another
              immediate action or a swift action until after your next turn if you have used an immediate action when it

              invisible creature and hope you hit something. You don’t have to see the creature you’re trying to hit, as
              you do with a targeted power. Intervening creatures and obstacles, however, can block your line of sight

            ><span>
              Some powers affect an 범위. Sometimes a power 묘사 specifies a specially defined 범위, but usually an 범위
              falls into one of the categories defined below.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of the shape of 범위, you select the point where the power originates, but otherwise you
            usually don’t control which creatures or objects the power affects. The point of origin of a power that
            affects an 범위 is always a grid intersection. When determining whether a given creature is within 범위
            of a power, count out the distance from the point of origin in squares just as you do when moving a
            character or when determining 거리 for a ranged 공격. The only difference is that instead of counting
            from the center of one square to the center of the next, you count from intersection to intersection.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can count diagonally across a square, but every second diagonal counts as 2 squares of distance. If the
            far edge of a square is within the power’s 범위, anything within that square is within the power’s 범위. If
            the power’s 범위 touches only the near edge of a square, however, anything within that square is unaffected
            by the power.

              엄폐 from its point of origin (in other words, its effects don’t extend around corners). The default shape

          <h3>파워 저항</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">POWER RESISTANCE</div>
          <p>
            파워 저항 is a special defensive ability. If your power is being resisted by a creature with 파워 저항, you
            must make a 구현자 레벨 check (d20 + 구현자 레벨) at least equal to the creature’s 파워 저항 for the power
            to affect that creature. The defender’s 파워 저항 functions like an 방어도 against psionic 공격. 주문 저항
            is equivalent to 파워 저항 unless 사이오닉 Is Different option is in use. Include any adjustments to
            your 구현자 레벨 on this 구현자 레벨 check.
          </p>
          <p>
            파워 저항 line and 설명 문구 of a power 묘사 tell you whether 파워 저항 protects creatures from the
            power. In many cases, 파워 저항 applies only when a resistant creature is targeted by the power, not when a
            resistant creature encounters a power that is already in place.
          </p>
          <p>
            The terms “object” and “harmless” mean the same thing for 파워 저항 as they do for 내성 굴림. A creature
            with 파워 저항 must voluntarily lower 저항(a standard action) to be affected by a power noted as 해악
            less. In such a case, you do not need to make 구현자 레벨 check described above.

          <p>All powers have a 파워 포인트 line, indicating the power’s cost.</p>

            The psionic character class tables show how many 파워 포인트 a character has access to each day, depending
            on 레벨.

          <p>
            A power’s cost is determined by its 레벨, as shown below. Every power’s cost is noted in its 묘사 for ease

              Some powers allow you to spend more than their base cost to achieve an improved effect, or augment the
              power. The maximum number of points you can spend on a power (for any reason) is equal to your 구현자

              On the same line that the power point cost of a power is indicated, the power’s 경험치 비용, if any, is
              noted. Particularly powerful effects entail an 경험치 비용 to you. No spell or power can restore XP lost
              in this manner. You cannot spend so much XP that you lose a 레벨, so you cannot manifest a power with an
              XP cost unless you have enough XP to spare. However, you can, on gaining enough XP to attain a new 레벨,
              use those XP for manifesting a power rather than keeping them and advancing a 레벨. The XP are expended
              when you manifest the power, whether or not the manifestation succeeds.</span

            This portion of a power 묘사 details what the power does and how it works. If one of the previous lines in

            based on another power you might have to refer to a different power for the “see text” information. If a

              Many powers have variable effects based on the number of 파워 포인트 you spend when you manifest them. The
              more points spent, the more powerful the manifestation. How this extra expenditure affects a power is
              specific to the power. Some augmentations allow you to increase the number of 피해 주사위, while others
              extend a power’s 지속시간 or modify a power in unique ways. Each power that can be augmented includes an
              entry giving how many 파워 포인트 it costs to augment and the effects of doing so. However, you can spend
              only a total number of points on a power equal to your 구현자 레벨.</span

            Augmenting a power takes place as part of another action (manifesting a power). Unless otherwise noted in
            the Augment section of an individual power 묘사, you can augment a power only at the time you manifest it.
