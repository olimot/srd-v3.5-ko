        <div class="original-headline">WHAT ARE EPIC SPELLS?</div>
        <p>
          에픽 주문 are 주문 developed from the ground up using a list of magical ingredients called seeds. Despite
          their power, 에픽 주문 still follow the basic rules for 주문 시전하기, except as specifically noted otherwise.
          에픽 casters can manipulate the seeds of true magic, but knowing the seeds and how to manipulate them does not
          instantly grant ultimate power. Each 에픽 spell must be laboriously developed before it can be used.

        <h3>에픽 주문 획득하기</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">ACQUIRING EPIC SPELLS</div>
        <p>
          A character with 에픽 주문시전 feat may start 에픽 주문 획득하기 immediately. Using 에픽 주문 is a two-step
          procedure: development and spellcasting.

        <h3>에픽 주문 개발</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">EPIC SPELL DEVELOPMENT</div>
        <p>
          Before it can be cast, an 에픽 spell must be developed. The process of development can be a time-consuming and
          expensive process. It is during development that a caster determines whether a given 에픽 spell lies within
          his or her 능력 or beyond them. The basis of that determination lies in an 에픽 spell의 주문학 DC.
        </p>
        <p>
          The easiest way to develop an 에픽 spell is to use one already given. 묘사 of each of these unique 주문 gives
          the amount of gold, time, and experience points required to develop the spell. If a character pays a spell의
          development cost, he or she develops (and thus knows) that spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          For information on developing an 에픽 spell completely from scratch, see Developing Unique 에픽 주문, below.
        </p>

        <h3>에픽 주문시전</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">EPIC SPELLCASTING</div>
        <p>
          Once an 에픽 spell is developed, the caster knows the spell. A developed 에픽 spell becomes an indelible part
          of the caster and may be prepared without a 주문책 (if a 마법사 is the caster). Characters who cast 주문
          spontaneously, such as 소서러, can cast a developed 에픽 spell by using any open 에픽 spell slot. 드루이드,
          사제, and similar spellcasters can likewise prepare 에픽 주문 using 에픽 spell slots.
        </p>
        <p>
          A spellcaster can prepare or cast any 에픽 spell he or she knows as many times per day as he or she has
          available 에픽 spell slots. A spellcaster who can cast 에픽 주문 has a number of open 에픽 spell slots per day
          equal to one-tenth his or her ranks in 지식 skill appropriate to the spell and the caster의 class. 지식
          (arcana) is appropriate for arcane casters, and 지식(religion) or 지식(nature) is appropriate for 신성
          casters. The rules for rest between casting a day의 allotment of 에픽 주문 are the same as for rest required
          to prepare standard 주문. If the caster doesn’t use up a day의 allotment of 에픽 spell slots, the unused slots
          remain available whether or not the spellcaster receives appropriate rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if 에픽 spell has been developed and an 에픽 spell slot is available, successfully casting an 에픽 spell
          isn’t assured. The caster의 주문학 skill 수정치 is vital for casting an 에픽 spell. To cast an 에픽 spell, a
          spellcaster makes a 주문학 check against 에픽 spell의 주문학 DC. If the check succeeds, the spell is cast. If
          the caster fails the check, 에픽 spell fizzles and 에픽 spell slot is used for the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because 에픽 주문 require 주문학 checks, a spell is beyond the caster의 ability if the final 주문학 DC is 상급
          than 20 + the spellcaster의 주문학 수정치. 에픽 주문 with DCs higher than 10 + the spellcaster의 주문학 수정치
          are risky; a caster can take 10 when casting an 에픽 spell, but he or she can’t take 20. When routinely
          casting 에픽 주문, most spellcasters take 10 on their 주문학 checks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>에픽 Spell 레벨:</b><span>
            에픽 주문 have no fixed 레벨. However, for 목적 of 집중 checks, 주문 저항, and other possible situations
            where spell 레벨 is important, 에픽 주문 are all treated as if they were 10 레벨 주문.
          </span>

        <p>
          <b>메타마법, Items, and 에픽 주문:</b><span> 메타마법 특기 and other 에픽 특기 that manipulate normal 주문 cannot be used with 에픽 주문. </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          A character can’t 제작 a magic item that casts an 에픽 spell, regardless of whether the item is activated with
          spell completion, a spell 트리거, a 명령 word, or simple use. Only 상급 유물, which are beyond the means of
          even 에픽 characters to create, can possibly contain magic of this power.
        </p>
        <p>
          내성 굴림 against a character의 에픽 spell has a DC of 20 + the character의 relevant ability score 수정치.
          It의 possible to develop 에픽 주문 that have even higher DCs, however, by applying the appropriate factor.

        </p>
        <p>
          <b>에픽 Spell Slots: </b><span>A character must have an available 에픽 spell slot to prepare or cast an 에픽 spell, just as he or she
            needs a normal spell slot for a nonepic spell. A character doesn’t gain 에픽 spell slots by 미덕 of his or
            her 레벨 and class, however. A character gets one 에픽 spell slot for every 10 ranks he or she has in the
            relevant 지식 skill.

        <h3>무효화, 에픽 주문, 대마법 보호장</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">DISPELLING,EPIC SPELLS,AND ANTIMAGIC FIELD</div>
        <p>
          A lucky nonepic spellcaster casting <i>상급 마법 무효화 </i>might be able to
          dispel an 에픽 spell. The game mechanics do not change, and 에픽 주문 do not occupy any privileged position
          allowing them to resist being dispelled other than their presumably high 시전자 레벨. Likewise, 에픽 주문
          using the <i>dispel </i>seed can dispel nonepic 주문. Such 에픽 주문 use the
          same game mechanic: The check to dispel is 1d20 + a specified number (usually dispeller의 레벨), and the DC is
          11 + the spellcaster의 레벨.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>대마법 보호장 </i><span>does not automatically suppress 에픽 주문 as it does standard 주문. Instead, each time an 에픽 spell is
            subject to an <i>항마 fiel</i>d, make a dispel check as a 20th-레벨 caster
            (1d20 + 20). 에픽 spell has a DC of 11 + 에픽 spell의 spellcaster 레벨. If the suppression check is
            successful, 에픽 spell is suppressed like any other spell. If the dispel check is unsuccessful, 에픽 spell
            functions normally.</span>

        <div class="original-headline">EPIC SPELL DESCRIPTIONS</div>
        <p>
          Each 에픽 spell 묘사 follows the same format used for 0- to 9th-레벨 주문<i>. </i>There are two additional entries for 에픽 주문: 주문학 DC and To Develop.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>주문학 DC:</b><span>
            This is the DC of 주문학 check required to cast 에픽 spell. When casting an 에픽 spell, the character gains
            a +5 보너스 on his or her 주문학 check if the base seed of 에픽 spell is from the character의 arcane 학파
            specialty or primary psionic 분야. The character takes a –15 페널티 if 에픽 spell seed is from his or her
            prohibited arcane 학파.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>To Develop:</b><span>
            The first part of this entry shows the resources in gold, time, and experience points a character must
            expend to develop the spell shown. If the character expends the resources, he or she develops the spell if
            he or she has access to all the seeds. 주문 containing the <i>life </i>or
            <i>치료 </i>seed are typically only available to those with 24 or more
            ranks in 지식(religion) or 지식(nature). The rest of the development entry details the seeds and factors
            used to create 에픽 spell. This information is provided as an example for characters when they attempt to
            create and develop their own unique 에픽 주문.

          After casting <i>해충의 왕관, </i>one thousand venomous, biting and stinging
          spiders, scorpions, beetles, and centipedes erupt from the very air around the character. This 무리 떼 forms a
          living aura around the character to a radius of 10 feet. The character is immune to his or her own
          <i>crown of vermi</i>n. 무리 떼 goes where the character goes at his or her
          속도, even if the character takes to the air or water (though water drowns the vermin after 1 full round of
          immersion, unless the spell is cast underwater, in which case aquatic or marine vermin answer the call and
          cannot leave the water). Each vermin in the <i>해충의 왕관 </i>bites a
          creature who enters 범위 occupied by the effect (or the character forces the effect into an 범위 occupied by
          another creature) for 1 point of 피해, and then dies. Each victim takes enough points of 피해 to kill it,
          destroying that number of vermin in the process. Victims get a Reflex 내성 굴림 each round to avoid the full
          press, and if successful, take only 10d10 bites (and 10d10 points of 피해). A total of 1,000 points of 피해
          can be dealt to those who fall prey to the <i>crown of vermi</i>n. The vermin
          have 피해 축소 1/에픽, so the vermin의 natural 무기 are treated as 에픽 for 목적 of overcoming 피해 축소. If
          there aren’t enough vermin to kill all the creatures in the spell의 effect, the creature with the fewest 히트
          포인트 is affected first, then the creature with the second fewest 히트 포인트, and so on. After all creatures
          that can be killed have been killed, any remaining 피해 is distributed among the survivors equally.
        </p>
        <p>
          The character has utter control over the vermin in his or her aura, and can force them into 범위 that would
          normally deter common vermin. The character can completely suppress his or her vermin aura as a free action so
          that no vermin are visible at all. The time that vermin are suppressed does not count toward the spell의
          지속시간. Alternatively, the character can roughly shape and 이동 the vermin in any fashion he or she desires
          within the limits of the 10-foot-radius spread as a 이동-equivalent action. The vermin cannot be wrested from
          the character의 control through any means. The vermin make all 내성 굴림 to avoid damaging effects using the
          character의 base 내성 굴림 보너스. They gain the character의 주문 저항, if any, and they get 내성 굴림 against
          주문 that would otherwise automatically slay vermin. A character can see through his or her
          <i>해충의 왕관 </i>without difficulty, but gains one-half 은폐 against enemy
          공격 launched both outside and within the character의 <i>crown of vermi</i>n.

          The character sends his or her foe to hell. If the character succeeds at a melee touch 공격, the target must
          succeed at a Will 내성 굴림(DC = the standard 에픽 spell DC + 15). If he or she fails this 내성 굴림, he or
          she is sent straight to a layer of a lawful evil plane (or a chaotic evil plane, at the character의 option)
          swarming with fiends. The subject will not willingly leave the plane for 20 hours, believing that his or her
          predicament is a just reward for an ill-spent life. Even after the 충동 fades, he or she must devise his or

          subject encounters a group of 1d4 핏 핀드(or 발러, if in a chaotic evil plane) every hour he or she spends in

          The character instantly slays a single target and at the same moment animate the body so that it appears that
          nothing has happened to the creature. The target의 companions (if any) do not immediately realize what has
          transpired. The target receives a Fortitude 내성 굴림 to survive 공격. If the save fails, the target remains
          in its exact position with no apparent ill effects. In reality, it is now a 구울 under the character의
          control. The target의 companions notice nothing unusual about the state of the target until they interact with
          it, at which time each companion receives a Will 내성 굴림 to notice discrepancies. 구울 serves the character
          indefinitely. The character cannot exceed the normal limit for controlling undead through use of this spell,
          but other means that allow the character to exceed the normal limit for controlled undead work just as well

          The character and any creatures he or she touches are drawn into the region of 꿈꾸기. The character can take

          The character physically enters the land of 꿈꾸기, leaving nothing behind. For every minute the character
          이동 through 꿈꾸기 landscape, he or she can “wake” to find him or her self five miles displaced in the waking
          world. The character does not know precisely where he or she will come out in the waking world, nor the
          상태이상 of the waking world through which the character travels. The character knows approximately where he
          or she will end up based on time spent traveling in 꿈꾸기.
          <i>꿈의 영역 </i>can also be used to travel to other 이세계 that contain
          creatures that 꿈꾸기, but doing this requires crossing into 꿈꾸기 of outsiders, where the character is
          subject to the dangers of alien 꿈꾸기 realities. This is a potentially perilous proposition. Transferring to
          another plane of existence requires 1d4 hours of uninterrupted journey. Any creatures touched by the character
          when <i>꿈의 영역 </i>is cast also make the transition to the borders of
          unconscious thought. They may opt to follow the character, wander off into 꿈꾸기 of others, or stumble back
          into the waking world (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by the
          character). Creatures unwilling to accompany the character into the region of 꿈꾸기 receive a Will save,
          negating the effect if successful.

          Upon casting <i>허깨비, </i>the character creates a duplicate version of him
          or her self as the character was when he or she was a 21st-레벨 character, and the character gains one
          negative 레벨 while the duplicate persists. For each additional negative 레벨 the character bestow upon him or
          her self at the time of casting, 허깨비 has one additional character 레벨. No matter how many negative 레벨
          the character bestows on him or her self, 허깨비 can never have more character 레벨 than the character has
          (taking the negative 레벨 into account). Treat the duplicate as the character with a number of negative 레벨
          conferred that would lower him or her to the character 레벨 of 허깨비. 허깨비 is considered fresh and rested
          when created. It may cast any spell the character has access to, including an 에픽 spell. Use 허깨비의 주문학
          수정치 as the basis for the number of 에픽 주문 it can cast in a day, and its effective character 레벨 as a
          basis for its 스킬, 특기, and other 능력. 허깨비 is effectively lower 레벨 than the character and probably
          can’t cast all 주문 he or she knows. A powerful enough 허깨비 might conceivably cast the
          <i>허깨비 </i>spell itself. 허깨비 appears in whatever mundane 의류 the
          character desires when initially conjured, but it has no other possessions. It shares part of the character의
          soul, so it is the character for all intents and 목적. The character and his or her
          <i>허깨비 </i>communicate with each other normally. Usually, 허깨비 does not
          begrudge its brief existence, because it is still part of the character. If 허깨비 is killed prior to the
          expiration of the spell의 지속시간, the character immediately regains the lost 레벨. Normally, 허깨비 does not
          last long enough to threaten the character with permanent 레벨 drain.

          The character makes a permanent thrall of any living creature. The character establishes a telepathic link
          with the subject의 mind. If the creature has a language, the character can generally force the subject to 공연
          as he or she desires, within the limits of its 능력. If the creature has no language, the character can
          communicate only basic 명령. The character knows what the subject is experiencing, but does not receive direct
          sensory input from it. A subject forced to take an action against its nature receives a 내성 굴림 with a
          페널티 of –10 to resist taking that particular action, but if it succeeds, it still remains the character의
          thrall despite its minor mutiny. Once a subject makes a successful 내성 굴림 to resist a specific order, it
          makes all future 내성 굴림 to resist taking that specific action without 페널티.
          <i>악 방어 마법 </i>or a similar spell can prevent the character from
          exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so protected, but it does not prevent the
          establishment of <i>노예화 </i>or dispel it.

          The character develops a spell that he or she can cast; thereafter, the spell can effectively “cast itself.”
          When the character casts the spell, a stroke of energy deals 10d6 points of electricity 피해 to each creature
          within the spell의 범위. <i>살아있는 번개 </i>follows all the standard rules
          for 에픽 spell casting when the character casts it. <i>살아있는 번개 </i>is
          sentient and generally friendly toward the character. It has the character의 mental 능력 점수, but it has no
          physical 능력 점수. It senses the world through the character의 senses and communicates with him or her by
          thought. As a self-triggering spell, it isn’t truly alive but is a fragment of the character의 personality. It
          cares little for the world around it, but at the character의 urging (and sometimes at its own discretion) it
          casts itself at his or her foes. Casters who prepare 주문 before casting must prepare
          <i>살아있는 번개 </i>normally in order for it to cast itself. When the spell
          casts itself, it acts on the character의 선제권 but does not count against his or her own actions in the
          round. The character cannot simultaneously cast <i>살아있는 번개 </i>while it
          is casting its own effect, even if it has been prepared more than once.
          <i>살아있는 번개 </i>uses up one of the character의 에픽 spell slots for the
          day whenever it casts itself. When the character has used up all his or her 에픽 spell slots for the day (or
          has cast all his or her prepared <i>살아있는 번개 </i>주문, if a caster who
          must prepare 주문), <i>살아있는 번개 </i>becomes quiescent. It remains so
          until the character has rested to regain his or her 에픽 spell slots for the next day.

          The character is possessed by a 꿈 애벌래. For 20 rounds, 꿈 애벌래의 body physically replaces the
          character’s, though 꿈 애벌래 has the character의 장비. 꿈 애벌래 is free to call on all its own powers and
          능력, or use the character의 장비. The character의 consciousness and physical form are suppressed for 지속시간
          of the possession. The character has no way to dismiss the spell, communicate, or otherwise maintain awareness
          once possession has commenced. 꿈 애벌래, temporarily freed from its 감금 in some distant 밤마귀, will attempt
          to slay and incapacitate any creature it can see or find, whether it is a friend or foe of the caster. Casting
          <i>밤마귀 군주 </i>entails some risk for the caster, since it의 unknown what
          a 꿈 애벌래 might do over the course of 20 rounds. The larva will dispatch all enemies it can find before
          turning to its own concerns. Sometimes a 꿈 애벌래 will attempt to place itself in a dangerous or precarious
          situation prior to the end of the spell, leaving the caster to extricate him or herself. If 꿈 애벌래 is slain
          during 지속시간 of the spell, the character의 consciousness is instantly restored to aware-ness within his or
          her own body. The character의 condition remains what it was when he or she completed casting
          <i>lord of 밤마귀</i>s, regardless of what 피해 꿈 애벌래 received. However,
          magic item 돌격 used, 물약 consumed, and other physical resources used up by 꿈 애벌래 are permanent.

          Ranged 공격 targeted against the character rebound on the original attacker. Any time during 지속시간, five
          공격 are automatically reflected back on the original attacker; the character decides which 공격 before 피해
          is rolled. The reflected 공격 rebounds on the attacker using the same 명중 굴림. Once five 공격 are so
          reflected, the spell ends.

          When <i>악성 역병 </i>is successfully cast, a wave of illness radites outward
          from the site of the ritual, instantly infecting every living thing in 범위 with the debilitating 질병 known
          as slimy 파멸. Within 24 hours, everything in 범위 begins to show signs of rot and decay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each day that a victim fails a Fortitude save, it takes 1d4 points of temporary 건강 피해. If the victim then
          fails a second save, 1 point of that 피해 is permanent drain. If the victim succeeds at the first 내성 굴림 of
          the day on consecutive days, he or she has recovered from 질병. This magical form of 질병 is not contagious
          and will not spread beyond those initially infected. Fruits and vegetables infected with slimy 파멸 are unfit
          for consumption, as are 질병-ridden livestock. This is a ritual spell requiring two other spellcasters, each
          of whom must expend an unused 에픽 spell slot for the casting. The primary caster must also burn 10,000 XP.

          This spell summons a swirling thunderstorm that rains fire rather than raindrops down on the character and
          everything within a two-mile radius of him or her. Everything caught unprotected or unsheltered in the flaming
          deluge takes 1 point of fire 피해 each round. A successful Reflex save results in no 피해, but the save must
          be repeated each round. Unless the ground is exceedingly damp, all vegetation is eventually blackened and
          destroyed, leaving behind a barren wasteland similar to the aftermath of a grass or forest fire. The fiery
          storm is stationary and persists even if the caster leaves.

          When a character casts this spell, he or she is temporarily able to take control of another sentient creature
          with whom the character is familiar (by meeting, observing, or successfully 염탐 the subject). The target
          receives a Will save, and if successful, prevents the character from making the telepathic connection. The
          target is aware of the attempted takeover as a strange, momentary tingling. If the Will save fails, the
          character is able to control the subject의 body as if it were his or her own, hearing, seeing, feeling,
          smelling, and tasting everything the target senses. Once the character dismisses the spell or its 지속시간

          witness trapped inside its own body. The target knows 이름 and general nature of its possessor if it succeeds

          When a character casts this spell, he or she is temporarily able to tap the consciousness of another sentient
          creature with whom the character is familiar (by meeting, observing, or successfully 염탐 the subject),
          experiencing everything he or she does with all five senses. The target receives a Will save, and if
          successful, prevents the character from making the telepathic connection. Whether 내성 굴림 is successful or
          not, the target is unaware of the attempted intrusion. Once the subject is tapped, the character is able to
          hear, see, feel, smell, and taste everything the subject senses. The character cannot control the subject,
          however. The character can only see what the subject chooses to look at, and the character tastes something
          only if the subject eats or drinks it during the spell의 지속시간. During this time, the character의 own body
          remains in a trance-like state. If the subject takes 피해, the character senses the injuries, although his or
          her own body does not actually suffer any ill effects. If the subject is knocked unconscious or killed, the
          spell immediately ends.

          On a failed save, the subject must spend a standard action each round abandoning his or her highest-레벨 spell
          (or losing his or her highest-레벨 unused spell slot). Each round, the subject eliminates another spell or
          spell slot, moving to lower-레벨 주문 once all the higher-레벨 주문 are gone. In the case of prepared 주문,
          the subject decides which 주문 to abandon at each 레벨. If the subject has more than one standard action
          allowed in the round, he or she may spend those actions as he or she desires. The subject doesn’t realize the
          주문 or spell slots are gone until he or she tries to 주문 시전 and finds it unavailable. Abandoning a spell
          slot or losing a spell is standard action, but it does not draw an 공격 of opportunity. It is a purely mental

          The character 잡아채기 him or her self from 1 round in the future, depositing this future self in an adjacent
          space as a free action that counts as a quickened spell. The character의 future self is technically only a
          possible future self (the time stream is a maelstrom of multiple probabilities), but snatching that future
          self from 1 round in the future collapses probability, and the possible future becomes the definite future.
          The character and his or her future self are both free to act normally this round (the character has already
          used up the limit of one quickened spell per round, but his or her duplicate hasn’t). The future self has all
          the resources the character has at the moment he or she finishes casting
          <i>time duplicat</i>e. Because the future self was previously only a
          possibility, his or her resources are not depleted as a result of whatever might occur this round (even if the
          character dies this round). Likewise, he or she doesn’t have any special 지식 of what might occur during this
          round. Because the future self is still part of the time stream, the round it spends with the character is a
          round it misses in its own future. Because the chracter의 future duplicate is also the character, the
          character misses the next round as well. He or she simply isn’t there. Tampering with the time stream is a
          tricky business. Here is a round-by-round summary.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Round One: </i><span>The character casts <i>time duplicat</i>e, the future self from round two
            arrives, and both act normally.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Round Two: </i><span>The future self—the character—gets snatched back in time to help the past self. During this round, there
            are no versions of the character present.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Round Three: </i><span>The character rejoins the time stream. The character arrives in the same location and condition that the
            future self ended with at the end of the first round. Any resources (주문, 피해, staff 돌격) the future self
            used up in round one are gone for real. Record them now. Using this spell to 잡아채기 a single future self
            stretches time and probability to its limit; more powerful versions of
            <i>시간 중복 </i>are not possible. A character cannot bring more than a
            single future version of him or her self back at one time, nor can a character 잡아채기 a version of him or
            her from farther in the future.

        <h2>에픽 주문 개발하기</h2>
        <div class="original-headline">DEVELOPING EPIC SPELLS</div>
        <p>
          An 에픽 spell is developed from smaller pieces called seeds and connecting pieces called factors. Every 에픽
          seed has a base 주문학 DC, and every factor has a Spell-제작 DC adjustment. When a desired spell is developed,
          the spellcaster spends resources and time to assemble the pieces that make up 에픽 spell. The base 주문학 DCs
          of each seed are added together; then the DC adjustments of the factors are added to that total. The sum
          equals the final 주문학 DC for 에픽 spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final 주문학 DC is the most significant gauge of 에픽 spell의 power. A spellcaster attempts to cast an
          에픽 spell by making a 주문학 check against 에픽 spell의 주문학 DC. Thus, a spellcaster knows immediately,
          based on his or her own 주문학 보너스, what 에픽 주문 are within his or her capability to cast, which are
          risky, and which are beyond him or her. 에픽 casters don’t commit time and money to develop 에픽 주문 until
          they are powerful enough to cast them.
        </p>
        <p>
          An 에픽 spell developed by an arcane spellcaster is arcane, and an 에픽 spell developed by a 신성 spellcaster
          is 신성. A character who can cast both 신성 and arcane 에픽 주문 chooses whether a particular spell he or she
          develops will be arcane or 신성. If that same caster uses the <i>치료 </i>or
          <i>life </i>seed in an 에픽 spell, that spell is always considered 신성. All
          에픽 주문 described here can be developed independently by a character who spends the necessary time, money,
          and experience points. Alternatively, a character can use those 주문 as a starting point when creating
          customized versions of 주문.

            <b>Combining 구성요소 and 시전 시간: </b><span>Almost every 에픽 spell has verbal and somatic 구성요소 and a 1-minute 시전 시간, regardless of the
              number of 에픽 seeds combined. The only exceptions are 에픽 주문 with the
              <i>치료 </i>and <i>life </i>seeds, which
              have 신성 focus 구성요소.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Combining 거리, Targets, 범위, and 효과:</b><span>
              One seed might have a 거리 of 12,000 feet, another seed might have a 거리 of 400 feet, and a third seed
              might not have a 거리 at all. Likewise, some seeds have targets, while others have an effect or an 범위.
              To determine which seed takes precedence in the finished 에픽 spell, the character must decide which seed
              is the base seed. The seed most important to the spell의 overall 목적 is the base seed, and it determines
              시전 시간, 거리, target, and so on. The other seeds apply only their specific effects to the finished
              spell. It is occasionally difficult to determine a base seed by examining the spell의 effects. If no one
              seed is most important, simply pick one seed for 목적 of making this determination.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Combining 지속시간:</b><span>
              When combining two or more seeds to develop an 에픽 spell, the seed with the shortest 지속시간 determines
              지속시간 of the finished 에픽 spell. If any seed of an 에픽 spell is dismissible by the caster, the 에픽
              spell is dismissible.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>내성 굴림:</b><span>
              Even if more than one seed has an associated 내성 굴림, the final spell will have only a single 내성 굴림.
              If two or more seeds have the same kind of 내성 굴림(Fortitude, Reflex, or Will), then obviously that will
              be used for the spell의 내성 굴림. If the seeds have different kinds of 내성 굴림, simply choose the 내성
              굴림 that seems most appropriate for the final spell.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>주문 저항:</b><span>
              When combining two or more seeds to develop an 에픽 spell, if even one seed is subject to 주문 저항, the
              finished 에픽 spell is subject to it as well.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Factors: </b><span>Factors are not part of 에픽 seeds, but they are the tools used to modify specific parameters of any
              given seed. Applying factors to the seeds of an 에픽 spell can increase or decrease the final 주문학 DC,
              increase 지속시간, change 범위 of a spell, and affect many other aspects of the spell.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>There are three kinds of factors:</p>
          <p>1. Those that can affect a number of seeds.</p>
          <p>2. Those that can only be used with specific seeds.</p>
          <p>
            3. Those that reduce 주문학 DC rather than increasing it. These are referred to as mitigating factors. To
            calculate the final 주문학 DC of an 에픽 spell correctly, it의 important to determine the mitigating factors
            last, after all the factors that increase the DC have been accounted for.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Development Is an Art:</b><span>
              Many times developing a completely new 에픽 spell requires some guesswork and rule stretching. As with
              making and pricing 마법 아이템, a sort of balancing act is required. Often 묘사 of a seed will need to be
              stretched for a particular spell. If necessary, assess an “ad hoc” 주문학 DC adjustment for any effect
              that cannot be extrapolated from the seeds and factors presented here—the example 주문 use ad hoc factors
              frequently. In all cases, the GM determines the actual 주문학 DC of the new spell</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Approval:</b><span>
              This is the final step, and it의 critically important. 에픽 주문 개발 work and reasoning must be shown to
              the GM and receive his or her approval. If the GM doesn’t approve, then 에픽 spell cannot be developed.
              However, the GM should explain why 에픽 spell wasn’t approved and possibly offer 제안 on how to create an
              에픽 spell that will be acceptable.

          <p>1 Each contingent spell in use counts as a slot used from the caster의 daily 에픽 spell slots.</p>
          <p>2 Seeds that already have an instantaneous or permanent 지속시간 cannot be increased.</p>
          <p>
            3 When changing a targeted or 범위 seed to a touch or ranged 공격, the seed no longer requires a save if it
            deals 피해, instead requiring a successful 명중 굴림. Seeds with a nondamaging effect still allow the target
            a save. 범위 주문 changed to touch or ranged 공격 now affect only the creature successfully attacked.
          </p>
          <p>
            4 When changing a touch or ranged 공격 seed to a targeted seed, the seed no longer requires an 명중 굴림 if
            it deals 피해, instead requiring a 내성 굴림 from the target. On a failed 내성 굴림, the target takes half
            피해. 범위 seeds changed to targeted seeds now only affect the target. The GM determines the most
            appropriate kind of 내성 굴림 for 에픽 spell.

          <p>
            5 에픽 주문 may only be inscribed on stone tablets or other substances of equal or 상급 hardness. Once a
            spell is so inscribed, another 에픽 spellcaster can learn it without going through the process of
            development. Once an inscribed 에픽 spell is learned by another 에픽 spellcaster in this fashion, the tablet
            upon which it is inscribed is destroyed and cannot be mended.

            1 The caster cannot somehow avoid or make him or her self immune to backlash 피해. For 주문 with 지속시간
            longer than instantaneous, the backlash 피해 is per round. If backlash 피해 kills a caster, no spell or
            method exists that will return life to the caster의 body without costing the caster a 레벨—not even
            <i>소원, 진정한 부활, 기적, </i>or 에픽 주문 that return life to the
            deceased<i>. </i>주문 that normally penalize the recipient one 레벨 when
            they return him or her to life penalize a caster killed by backlash two 레벨.
          </p>
          <p>
            2 When increasing 시전 시간 of a spell in order to reduce 주문학 DC, a character must first “use up” the
            maximum of 10 minutes (for a total DC 수정치 of –20). After that, a character can continue to add days to
            시전 시간, with a further 수정치 of –2 per day, up to the maximum of 100 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Additional Participants:</b><span>
              에픽 주문 can be developed that specifically require additional participants. These 주문 are called
              rituals. An 에픽 spell developed as a ritual requires a specific number of additional participants, who
              each must use up one spell slot of a specified 레벨 for the day. During an 에픽 spell의 development, the
              spell의 creator determines the number of additional participants and 레벨 of the spell slots to be
              contributed. If the exact number of spellcasters does not partake in the casting, or if the casters do not
              each contribute the proper spell slot, 에픽 spell automatically fails. To participate, each participant
              readies an action to contribute his or her raw spell energy when the primary caster begins the 에픽 spell.
              Additional participants in a ritual spell reduce 주문학 DC, as shown on 표: 의식 추가 참가자. Each
              additional participant may only contribute one spell slot. It doesn’t matter whether the additional
              participants are arcane or 신성 spellcasters; only 레벨 of the spell slot contributed matters. A
              contributed spell slot is treated as if normally cast. A 마법사 may contribute either a prepared, uncast
              spell slot, or an open, unprepared slot. 주문학 DC adjustments for each additional participant stack.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>특수: </i><span>A ritual 에픽 spell that takes longer than 1 standard action to cast requires all extra participants to
              stand as if casting for the same amount of time. If an extra participant is attacked while contributing a
              spell slot, the participant must make a 집중 check as if casting a spell of the same 레벨 as the slot
              contributed. If 공격 disrupts the participant in the ritual, 에픽 spell is not necessarily ruined.
              However, 주문학 DC reduction that would have been provided by that additional participant cannot be
              applied to the final 주문학 DC of 에픽 spell. Thus the ritual 에픽 spell will be harder for the primary
              spellcaster to cast.

            The caster can turn the bones or bodies of 죽음 creatures into undead that follow his or her spoken 명령.
            The undead can follow the caster, or they can remain in an 범위 and 공격 any creature (or a specific type of
            creature) entering the place. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed. (A destroyed undead can’t
            be animated again.) Intelligent undead can follow more sophisticated 명령. The
            <i>살아 움직이는 시체 </i>seed allows a character to create 20 HD of
            undead. For each additional 1 HD of undead created, increase 주문학 DC by +1. The undead created remain
            under the caster의 control indefinitely. A caster can naturally control 1 HD per 시전자 레벨 of undead
            creatures he or she has personally created, regardless of the method used. If the caster exceeds this
            number, newly created creatures fall under his or her control, and excess undead from previous castings
            become uncontrolled (the caster chooses which creatures are released). If the caster is a 사제, any undead
            he or she 명령 through his or her ability to 명령 or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit. For each
            additional 2 HD of undead to be controlled, increase 주문학 DC by +1. Only undead in excess of 20 HD created
            with this seed can be controlled using this DC adjustment. To both create and control more than 20 HD of
            undead, increase 주문학 DC by +3 per additional 2 HD of undead.

            This seed grants a creature additional 갑옷, providing a +4 보너스 to 방어도. 보너스 is either an 갑옷
            보너스 or a 자연 갑옷 보너스, whichever the caster selects. Unlike mundane 갑옷, the
            <i>갑옷 </i>seed provides an intangible protection that entails no 갑옷
            check 페널티, arcane 주문 실패 chance, or 속도 reduction. Incorporeal creatures can’t 바이패스 the
            <i>갑옷 </i>seed the way they can ignore normal 갑옷. For each additional

            using a different 보너스 type, such as deflection, 신성, or insight. For each additional point of 보너스 to
            방어도 of one of these types, increase 주문학 DC by +10.

            This seed compels a target to follow a course of activity. At the basic 레벨 of effect, a spell using the
            <i>compel </i>seed must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity
            sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do an obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect
            (unless 주문학 DC has been increased to avoid this limitation; see below). To compel a creature to follow an
            outright unreasonable course of action, increase 주문학 DC by +10. The compelled course of activity can
            continue for the entire 지속시간. If the compelled activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell
            ends when the subject finishes what he or she was asked to do. The caster can instead specify 상태이상 that
            will 트리거 a special activity during 지속시간. If the condition is not met before the spell using this seed
            expires, the activity is not performed.

            This seed can conceal a creature or object touched from sight, even from 암흑시야. If the subject is a
            creature carrying gear, the gear vanishes too, rendering the creature invisible. A spell using the
            <i>conceal </i>seed ends if the subject 공격 any creature. Actions directed
            at unattended objects do not break the spell, and causing 해악 indirectly is not an 공격. To create 투명화
            that lasts regardless of the actions of the subject, increase 주문학 DC by +4. Alternatively, this seed can
            conceal the exact location of the subject so that it appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location;
            this increases 주문학 DC by +2. The subject benefits from a 50% miss chance as if it had total 은폐.
            However, unlike actual total 은폐, this 변위 effect does not prevent enemies from targeting him or her

            This seed creates a nonmagical, unattended object of nonliving matter of up to 20 cubic feet in volume. The
            caster must succeed at an appropriate skill check to make a complex item. The seed can create matter ranging
            in hardness and rarity from vegetable matter all the way up to mithral and even adamantine. Simple objects
            have a natural 지속시간 of 24 hours. For each additional cubic foot of matter created, increase 주문학 DC by
            +2. Attempting to use any created object as a material component or a resource during 에픽 주문 개발 causes

            The <i>conjure </i>seed can be used in conjunction with the

            apply other 에픽 seeds to 에픽 spell that replicate the desired ability. To give the creature a supernatural
            or extraordinary ability rather than a 유사주문 ability, double the cost of the relevant seed. Remember
            that two doublings equals a tripling, and so forth. To give a creature 히트 다이스, use the
            <i>fortify </i>seed. Each 5 히트 포인트 granted to the creature gives it an
            additional 1 HD. Once successfully created, the new creature will breed true.

            the caster can currently see directly or through magical means) and can converse back and forth. The subject
            recognizes the caster if it knows him or her. It can answer in like manner immediately, though it does not
            have to. The caster can forge a communal bond among more than two creatures. For each additional creature
            contacted, increase 주문학 DC by +1. The bond can be established only among willing subjects, which

            At the base 주문학 DC of 20, a caster can also use the <i>contact </i>seed

            length of written text is limited to what can be contained (as text of a readable size) on the surface of
            the target. 통보 is delivered when specific 상태이상 are fulfilled according to the caster의 desire when the
            spell is cast.

            A spell developed with the <i>delude </i>seed creates the visual 환영술 of

            of the size of the effect by concentrating (the image is otherwise stationary). The image disappears when
            struck by an opponent unless the caster causes 환영술 to react appropriately. For an 환영술 that includes
            audible, olfactory, tactile, taste, and thermal aspects, increase 주문학 DC by +2 per extra aspect. Even
            realistic tactile and thermal 환영술 can’t deal 피해, however. For each additional image to be created,

            This seed can end ongoing 주문 that have been cast on a creature or object, temporarily suppress the magical
            능력 of a magic item, or end ongoing 주문(or at least their effects) within an 범위. A dispelled spell ends
            as if its 지속시간 had expired. The <i>dispel </i>seed can defeat all 주문,
            even those not normally subject to <i>dispel magi</i>c. The
            <i>dispel </i>seed can dispel (but not counter) the ongoing effects of
            supernatural 능력 as well as 주문, and it affects 유사주문 effects just as it affects 주문. One creature,
            object, or spell is the target of the <i>dispel </i>seed. The caster makes
            a dispel check against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or
            creature. A dispel check is 1d20 + 10 against a DC of 11 + the target spell의 시전자 레벨. For each
            additional +1 on the dispel check, increase 주문학 DC by +1. If targeting an object or creature that is the
            effect of an ongoing spell, make a dispel check to end the spell that affects the object or creature. If the
            object targeted is a magic item, make a dispel check against the item의 시전자 레벨. If succeessful, all the
            item의 magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A
            suppressed item becomes nonmagical for 지속시간 of the effect. An interdimensional interface is temporarily

            dome, or sphere of the desired energy that emanates the energy for up to 20 hours. One side of the wall,
            selected by the caster, sends forth waves of energy, dealing 2d4 points of energy 피해 to creatures within
            10 feet and 1d4 points of energy 피해 to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this 피해
            when it appears and in each round that a creature enters or remains in 범위. In addition, the wall deals
            2d6+20 points of energy 피해 to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double 피해 to undead
            creatures. For each additional 1d4 points of 피해, increase 주문학 DC by +2.
          </p>
          <p>
            The caster can also use the <i>energy </i>seed to create a spell that
            carefully releases and 균형 the emanation of cold, electricity, and fire, creating specific 날씨 effects for
            a period of 20 hours. Using the <i>energy </i>seed this way has a base
            주문학 DC of 25. 범위 extends to a two-mile-radius centered on the caster. Once the spell is cast, the 날씨
            takes 10 minutes to manifest. Ordinarily, a caster can’t directly target a creature or object, though
            indirect effects are possible. This seed can create cold snaps, heat waves, thunderstorms, 안개,
            blizzards—even a tornado that 이동 randomly in the affected 범위. Creating targeted damaging effects
            requires an additional use of the <i>energy </i>seed.

            The caster can foretell the immediate future, or gain information about specific questions. He or she is 90%
            likely to receive a meaningful reading of the future of the next 30 minutes. If successful, the caster knows
            if a particular action will bring good results, bad results, or no result. For each additional 30 minutes
            into the future, multiply 주문학 DC by x2. For better results, the caster can pose up to ten specific
            questions (one per round while he or she concentrates) to unknown powers of other 이세계, but the base

            a specific spell using the <i>foresee </i>seed can only be cast once every

            many negative 레벨 as 히트 다이스, it dies. If the subject survives and the negative 레벨 persist for 24

            This seed can summon an outsider. It appears where the caster designates and acts immediately, on his or her
            turn, if its 주문 저항 is overcome and it fails a Will 내성 굴림. It 공격 the caster의 opponents to the best
            of its ability. If the caster can communicate with the outsider, he or she can direct it not to 공격, to
            공격 particular enemies, or to 공연 other actions. The spell conjures an outsider the caster selects of CR 2
            or less. For each +1 CR of the summoned outsider, increase 주문학 DC by +2. For each additional outsider of
            the same 도전 지수 summoned, multiply 주문학 DC by x2. When a caster develops a spell with the
            <i>소환</i> seed that summons an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good,
            lawful, or water creature, the completed spell is also of that type.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the caster increases 주문학 DC by +10, he or she can summon a creature of CR 2 or less from another
            monster type or subtype. The summoned creature is assumed to have been plucked from some other plane (or
            somewhere on the same plane). The summoned creature 공격 the caster의 opponents to the best of its ability;
            or, if the caster can communicate with it, it will 공연 other actions. However, the summoning ends if the
            creature is asked to 공연 a task inimical to its nature. For each +1 CR of the summoned creature, increase
            주문학 DC by +2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, by increasing 주문학 DC by +60, the caster can summon a unique individual he or she specifies from
            anywhere in the multiverse. The caster must know the target의 이름 and some facts about its life, defeat any
            magical protection against discovery or other protection possessed by the target, and overcome the target의
            주문 저항, and it must fail a Will 내성 굴림. The target is under no special 충동 to serve the caster.

            주문 using the <i>transform </i>seed change the subject into another form
            of creature or object. The new form can 거리 in size from Diminutive to one size larger than the subject의
            normal form. For each additional increment of size change, increase 주문학 DC by +6. If the caster wants to
            transform a nonmagical, inanimate object into a creature of his or her type or transform a creature into a
            nonmagical, inanimate object, increase 주문학 DC by +10. To change a creature of one type into another type
            increase 주문학 DC by +5.
          </p>
          <p>
            변형 involving nonmagical, inanimate substances with hardness are more difficult; for each 2 points of
            hardness, increase 주문학 DC by +1.
          </p>
          <p>
            To transform a creature into an incorporeal or 기체 형태, increase 주문학 DC by +10. Conversely, to overcome
            the natural immunity of a gaseous or incorporeal creature to 변형, increase 주문학 DC by +10.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <i>transform </i>seed can also change its target into someone specific.
            To transform an object or creature into the specific likeness of another individual (including memories and
            mental 능력), increase 주문학 DC by +25. If the transformed creature doesn’t have 레벨 or 히트 다이스 of its
            new likeness, it can only use 능력 of the creature at its own 레벨 or 히트 다이스. If slain or destroyed,
            the transformed creature or object reverts to its original form. The subject의 장비, if any, remains
            untransformed or melds into the new form의 body, at the caster의 option. The transformed creature or object
            acquires the physical and natural 능력 of the creature or object it has been changed into while retaining
            its own memories and mental 능력 점수. Mental 능력 include personality, 지능, 지혜, and 매력 scores, 레벨
            and class, 히트 포인트(despite any change in its 건강 score), 성향, 기본 공격 보너스, base 내성 굴림,
            extraordinary 능력, 주문, and 유사주문 능력, but not its supernatural 능력. Physical 능력 include natural
            size and 근력, 민첩, and 건강 scores. Natural 능력 include 갑옷, natural 무기, and similar gross physical
            qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth), and possibly hardness.
            Creatures transformed into inanimate objects do not gain the benefit of their untransformed physical 능력,
            and may well be blind, deaf, dumb, and unfeeling. Objects transformed into creatures gain that creature의
            average physical 능력 점수, but are considered to have mental 능력 점수 of 0 (the
            <i>fortify </i>seed can add points to each mental ability, if desired). For
            each normal extraordinary ability or supernatural ability granted to the transformed creature, increase the
            주문학 DC by +10. The transformed subject can have no more 히트 다이스 than the caster has or than the
            subject has (whichever is 상급). In any case, for each Hit Die the assumed form has above 15, increase the
            주문학 DC by +2.

          <p>
            주문 using the <i>운송수단 </i>seed instantly take the caster to a
            designated destination, regardless of distance. For interplanar travel, increase 주문학 DC by +4. For each
            additional 50 pounds in objects and willing creatures beyond the base 1,000 pounds, increase 주문학 DC by
            +2. The base use of the <i>운송수단 </i>seed provides instantaneous travel
            through 영적 세계. To shift the transportation medium to another medium increase 주문학 DC by +2. The caster
            does not need to make a 내성 굴림, nor is 주문 저항 applicable to him or her. Only objects worn or carried
            (attended) by another person receive 내성 굴림 and 주문 저항. For a spell intended to 운송수단 unwilling
            creatures, increase 주문학 DC by +4. The caster must have at least a reliable 묘사 of the place to which he
            or she is transporting. If the caster attempts to use the
            <i>운송수단 </i>seed with insufficient or misleading information, the
            character disappears and simply reappear in his or her original location.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a special use of the <i>운송수단 </i>seed, a caster can develop a spell
            that temporarily 운송수단 him or her into a different time stream (leaving the caster in the same physical
            location); this increases 주문학 DC by +8. If the caster 이동 him or herself, or the subject, into a slower
            time stream for 5 rounds, time ceases to flow for the subject, and its condition becomes fixed—no force or
            effect can 해악 it until 지속시간 expires. If the caster 이동 him or her self into a faster time stream, the
            caster 속도 up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at
            their normal 속도. The caster is free to act for 5 rounds of apparent time. Fire, cold, 독 gas, and similar
            effects can still 해악 the caster. While the caster is in the fast time stream, other creatures are
            invulnerable to his or her 공격 and 주문; however, the caster can create spell effects and leave them to
            take effect when he or she reenters normal time. Because of the branching nature of time, 에픽 주문 used to
            운송수단 a subject into a faster time stream cannot be made permanent, nor can 지속시간 of 5 rounds be
            extended. More simply, the seed can <i>가속 </i>or
            <i>slow </i>a subject for 20 rounds by transporting it to the appropriate
            time stream. This decreases 주문학 DC by –4.

            This seed can grant a creature protection from 피해 of a specified type. The caster can protect a creature
            from standard 피해 or from energy 피해. The caster can protect a creature or 범위 from magic. Alternatively,
            he or she can hedge out a type of creature from a specified 범위. A ward against standard 피해 protects a
            creature from whichever two the caster selects of the three 피해 types: bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing.
            For a ward against all three types, increase 주문학 DC by +4. Each round, the spell created with the
            <i>ward </i>seed absorbs the first 5 points of 피해 the creature would
            otherwise take, regardless of whether the source of 피해 is natural or magical. For each additional point of
            protection, increase 주문학 DC by +2.
          </p>
          <p>
            A ward against energy grants a creature protection from whichever one the caster selects of the five energy
            types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. Each round, the spell absorbs the first 5 points of 피해 the
            creature would otherwise take from the specified energy type, regardless of whether the source of 피해 is
            natural or magical. The spell protects the recipient의 장비 as well. For each additional point of
            protection, increase 주문학 DC by +1.
          </p>
          <p>
            A ward against a specific type of creature prevents bodily contact from whichever one of several monster
            types the caster selects. This causes the natural weapon 공격 of such creatures to fail and the creatures to
            recoil if such 공격 require touching the warded creature. The protection ends if the warded creature makes
            an 공격 against or intentionally 이동 within 5 feet of the blocked creature. 주문 저항 can allow a creature
            to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.
          </p>
          <p>
            A ward against magic creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere (with radius 10 feet) that
            surrounds the caster and excludes all spell effects of up to 1 레벨. Alternatively, the caster can ward just
            the target and not create the radius effect. For each additional 레벨 of 주문 to be excluded, increase the
            주문학 DC by +20 (but see below). 범위 or effect of any such 주문 does not include 범위 of the ward, and
            such 주문 fail to affect any target within the ward. This includes 유사주문 능력 and 주문 or 유사주문
            effects from 마법 아이템. However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the ward. The caster can
            leave and return to the protected 범위 without 페널티(unless the spell specifically targets a creature and
            does not provide a radius effect). The ward could be brought down by a targeted
            <i>마법 무효화 </i>spell. 에픽 주문 using the
            <i>dispel </i>seed may bring down a ward if the enemy spellcaster succeeds
            at a 시전자 레벨 check. The ward may also be brought down with a targeted 에픽 spell using the
            <i>destroy </i>seed if the enemy spellcaster succeeds at a 시전자 레벨
            check.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of creating an 에픽 spell that uses the <i>ward </i>seed to nullify
            all 주문 of a given 레벨 and lower, the caster can create a ward that nullifies a specific spell (or
            specific set of 주문). For each specific spell so nullified, increase 주문학 DC by +2 per spell 레벨 above
            1st.

          </p>
          <p>
            Psionic characters take 에픽 Manifestation feat, which works just like 에픽 주문시전 feat. The 전제조건 for
            this feat are 24 ranks of 사이크래프트, 24 ranks of 지식(사이오닉), and the ability to manifest 9th-레벨

            The spellcaster creates a finite plane with limited access: a demiplane. Demiplanes created by this power
            are very small, very minor 이세계.
          </p>
          <p>
            A character can only cast this spell while on 에테리얼 세계. When he or she casts the spell, a local density
            fluctuation precipitates the creation of a demiplane. At first, the fledgling plane grows at a rate of 1
            foot in radius per day to an initial maximum radius of 180 feet as it rapidly draws substance from
            surrounding ethereal vapors and protomatter.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>The spellcaster determines 환경 within the demiplane when he or she first casts
              <i>창세, </i>reflecting most any desire the spellcaster can visualize.
              The spellcaster determines factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the general shape of the
              terrain. This spell cannot create life (including vegetation), nor can it create 제작(such as buildings,
              roads, wells, </span><span>던전, and so forth). The spellcaster must add these things in some other fashion if he or she desires.
              Once the basic demiplane reaches its maximum size, the spellcaster can continue to cast this spell to
              enlarge the demiplane, adding another 180 feet of radius to the demiplane each time.</span>
