      <p>The tarrasque is 70 feet long and 50 feet tall, and it weighs about 130 tons.</p>
      <p>The tarrasque cannot speak.</p>
      <section id="h2-2-combat">
        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>The tarrasque attacks with its claws, teeth, horns, and tail.</p>
        <p>
          The tarrasque’s natural weapons are treated as epic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>증강 치명타 (범):</strong> The tarrasque’s bite threatens a critical hit on a natural attack roll of
          18–20, dealing triple damage on a successful critical hit.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>끔찍한 존재 (초):</strong> The tarrasque can inspire terror by charging or attacking. Affected
          creatures must succeed on a DC 36 Will save or become shaken, remaining in that condition as long as they
          remain with 60 feet of the tarrasque. The save DC is Charisma-based.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>향상된 잡아채기 (범):</strong> To use this ability, the tarrasque must hit a Huge or smaller opponent
          with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
          opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the foe the following
          round.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>쇄도 (범):</strong> Once per minute, the normally slow-moving tarrasque can move at a speed of 150
          feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>집어 삼키기 (범):</strong> The tarrasque can try to swallow a grabbed opponent of Huge or smaller size
          by making a successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+8 points of crushing damage plus
          2d8+6 points of acid damage per round from the tarrasque’s digestive juices. A swallowed creature can cut its
          way out by dealing 50 points of damage to the tarrasque’s digestive tract (AC 25). Once the creature exits,
          muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. The tarrasque’s gullet
          can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium, 128 Small, or 512 Tiny or smaller creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>껍질 (범):</strong> The tarrasque’s armorlike carapace is exceptionally tough and highly reflective,
          deflecting all rays, lines, cones, and even <i>magic missile</i>spells. There is a 30% chance of reflecting
          any such effect back at the caster; otherwise, it is merely negated. Check for reflection before rolling to
          overcome the creature’s spell resistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>재생 (범):</strong> No form of attack deals lethal damage to the tarrasque. The tarrasque regenerates
          even if it fails a saving throw against a <i>disintegrate</i> spell or a death effect. If the tarrasque fails
          its save against a spell or effect that would kill it instantly (such as those mentioned above), the spell or
          effect instead deals nonlethal damage equal to the creature’s full normal hit points +10 (or 868 hp). The
          tarrasque is immune to effects that produce incurable or bleeding wounds, such as mummy rot, a sword with the
          wounding special ability, or a clay golem’s cursed wound ability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tarrasque can be slain only by raising its nonlethal damage total to its full normal hit points +10 (or
          868 hit points) and using a <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> spell to keep it dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the tarrasque loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in 1d6 minutes (the detached piece dies
          and decays normally). The creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump.
        </p>
        <p><strong>스킬:</strong> The tarrasque has a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.</p>

      <p>A tendriculos can rear up to a height of 15 feet. It weighs about 3,500 pounds.</p>
      <p>
        Animals and other plant creatures are unnerved by the presence of a tendriculos; they avoid it and any place it
        has been within the last 24 hours.
      </p>
      <section id="h2-4-combat">
        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>
          Prowling deep forests or waiting in vegetated areas (looking like nothing more than a small hillock), a
          tendriculos attacks savagely, showing no fear. It attempts to swallow as much flesh as it can, as quickly as
          it can.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>향상된 잡아채기 (범):</strong> To use this ability, a tendriculos must hit a creature at least one
          size smaller than itself with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
          provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow
          the opponent in the following round. A tendriculos can also use its improved grab ability on a tendril attack.
          If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold, picks up the opponent, and transfers it to the mouth as a
          free action, automatically dealing bite damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>집어 삼키기/마비 (범):</strong> A tendriculos can try to swallow a grabbed opponent by making a
          successful grapple check. Once inside the plant’s mass, the opponent must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or
          be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds by the tendriculos’s digestive juices, taking 2d6 points of acid damage per round.
          A new save is required each round inside the plant. The save DC is Constitution-based. A swallowed creature
          that avoids paralysis can climb out of the mass with a successful grapple check. This returns it to the
          plant’s maw, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. A swallowed creature can also cut
          its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the tendriculos’s
          interior (AC 14). Once the creature exits, the plant’s regenerative capacity closes the hole; another
          swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Huge tendriculos’s interior can hold 2 Large, 8 Medium, 32
          Small, 128 Tiny, or 512 Diminutive or smaller opponents.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>재생 (범):</strong> Bludgeoning weapons and acid deal normal damage to a tendriculos. A tendriculos
          that loses part of its body mass can regrow it in 1d6 minutes. Holding the severed portion against the mass
          enables it to reattach instantly.

      <p>A thoqqua is about 1 foot in diameter and 4 to 5 feet long. It weighs about 200 pounds.</p>
      <section id="h2-6-combat">
        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>
          When a thoqqua is disturbed, its first instinct is to attack. Its favored tactic is to spring directly at a
          foe, either by bursting out of the rock or by coiling up its body and launching itself like a spring. (Treat
          this as a charge, even though the thoqqua does not need to move 10 feet before attacking.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>열 (범):</strong> Merely touching or being touched by a thoqqua automatically deals 2d6 fire damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>태우기 (범):</strong> When a thoqqua hits with its slam attack, the opponent must succeed on a DC 12
          Reflex save or catch fire. The save DC is Constitution-based. The flame burns for 1d4 rounds if not
          extinguished sooner. A burning creature can use a full-round action to put out the flame.

          <strong>과대 무기 (범):</strong> A titan wields a great, two-handed warhammer (big enough for Gargantuan
          creatures) without penalty.

          are Charisma-based.

          In addition, titans of good or neutral alignment can use the following additional spell-like abilities: At

        <p>
          Titans enjoy combat and usually close with their foes. If that proves ineffective, they swiftly back off and
          pelt the foe with spell-like abilities and magical effects. Because of a titan’s Quicken Spell-Like Ability
          feat, it can use <i>chain lightning</i> as a free action, and frequently attacks in melee while lashing out
          with this ability at the same time.
        </p>
        <p><i>Prior to combat: Invisibility purge</i> or <i>invisibility</i>.</p>

          <em>라운드 1:</em> Charge and attempt to sunder the weapon of the most dangerous foe. Hurl
          <i>chain lightning</i> at opponents standing away from the fight.

        <p>
          <em>라운드 2:</em> Full attack against the disarmed opponent, and hurl <i>chain lightning</i> at other
          opponents.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>라운드 3:</em> Back away from first opponent and use <i>maze</i> or <i>meteor swarm</i> on any spellcaster

        <p>
          <em>라운드 4:</em> Sunder the weapon of the next most effective combatant, or use
          <i>greater dispel magic</i> on all nearby opponents.
        </p>
        <p><em>라운드 5:</em> Full attack against any nearby opponent, or use <i>fire storm</i>.</p>
        <p>Use another quickened <i>chain lightning</i> if foes seem really dangerous.</p>
        <p>
          A titan usually reserves its <i>gate</i> and <i>etherealness</i> abilities to escape a fight that is not going
          well.

        A tojanida’s shell is blue-green in color. Inside the shell is a fleshy body from which extend seven stalks.
        Four of these stalks have paddles for locomotion, two are tipped with claws, and one bears the creature’s head.
        Eight vents in the shell, four at each end, allow the tojanida to thrust its stalks out in whatever
        configuration it finds convenient.
      </p>
      <p>
        A juvenile tojanida is up to 25 years old. It has a shell about 3 feet long, and it weighs about 60 pounds. An
        adult is aged 26 to 80. Its shell is about 6 feet long, and it weighs about 220 pounds. An elder can reach 150
        years of age. It has a shell about 9 feet long, and it weighs about 500 pounds.
      </p>
      <p>Tojanidas speak Aquan and can be loquacious, but usually only on the subject of food.</p>
      <section id="h2-11-combat">
        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>향상된 잡아채기 (범):</strong> To use this ability, a tojanida must hit with a bite or claw attack. It
          can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. Underwater, a
          tojanida can tow a grabbed victim of its own size or smaller at its swim speed (but it cannot run). A favorite
          tactic is to grab a single opponent, then withdraw, hauling the opponent away from its allies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>먹물 구름 (범):</strong> A tojanida can emit a spherical cloud of jet-black ink with a radius of 30
          feet once per minute as a free action. The effect is otherwise similar to <i>fog cloud</i> cast by an
          individual of a level equal to the tojanida’s Hit Dice. Out of water, the ink emerges in a stream up to 30
          feet long, which a tojanida can squirt into an opponent’s eyes. The affected creature must succeed on a Reflex
          save or be blinded for 1 round. The save DC is 13 against a juvenile, 15 against an adult, and 21 against an
          elder. The save DCs are Constitution based.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>전방위 시야 (범):</strong> The multiple apertures in a tojanida’s shell allow it to look in any
          direction, bestowing a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Search checks. Opponents gain no flanking bonuses when
          attacking a tojanida.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>스킬:</strong> A tojanida has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or
          avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
          the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

        A treant’s leaves are deep green in the spring and summer. In the fall and winter the leaves change to yellow,
        orange, or red, but they rarely fall out. A treant’s legs fit together when closed to look like the trunk of a
        tree, and a motionless treant is nearly indistinguishable from a tree.
      </p>
      <p>A treant is about 30 feet tall, with a “trunk” about 2 feet in diameter. It weighs about 4,500 pounds.</p>
      <p>
        Treants speak their own language, plus Common and Sylvan. Most also can manage a smattering of just about all
        other humanoid tongues—at least enough to say “Get away from my trees!”
      </p>
      <section id="h2-13-combat">
        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>
          Treants prefer to watch potential foes carefully before attacking. They often charge suddenly from cover to
          trample the despoilers of forests. If sorely pressed, they animate trees as reinforcements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><i>살아 움직이는 나무</i>(주):</strong> A treant can animate trees within 180 feet at will,
          controlling up to two trees at a time. It takes 1 full round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter it
          moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a treant in all respects. Animated trees lose their ability to move
          if the treant that animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. The ability is otherwise similar to
          <i>liveoak</i> (caster level 12th). Animated trees have the same vulnerability to fire that a treant has.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>물체 상대로 두배 피해 (범):</strong> A treant or animated tree that makes a full attack against an
          object or structure deals double damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>짓밟기 (범):</strong> Reflex DC 22 half. The save DC is Strength-based. Skills: *Treants have a +16
          racial bonus on Hide checks made in forested areas.

      <p>A troglodyte stands about 5 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.</p>
      <p>Troglodytes speak Draconic.</p>
      <section id="h2-17-combat">
        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>
          Half of a group of troglodytes are armed only with claws and teeth; the rest carry one or two javelins and
          clubs. They normally conceal themselves, launch a volley of javelins, then close to attack. If the battle goes
          against them, they retreat and attempt to hide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stench (Ex): When a troglodyte is angry or frightened, it secretes an oily, musk-like chemical that nearly
          every form of animal life finds offensive. All living creatures (except troglodytes) within 30 feet of a
          troglodyte must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or be sickened for 10 rounds. The save DC is
          Constitution-based. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same troglodyte’s stench for 24
          hours. A <i>delay poison</i> or <i>neutralize poison</i> spell removes the effect from the sickened creature.
          Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus
          on their saving throws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Skills: The skin of a troglodyte changes color somewhat, allowing it to blend in with its surroundings like a
          chameleon and providing a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks. *In rocky or underground settings, this bonus
          improves to +8.

        Trolls walk upright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders. Their gait is uneven, and when they run, their
        arms dangle and drag along the ground. For all this seeming awkwardness, trolls are very agile.
      </p>
      <p>
        A typical adult troll stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. Females are slightly larger than males. A
        troll’s rubbery hide is moss green, mottled green and gray, or putrid gray. The hair is usually greenish black
        or iron gray.

      <p>Trolls speak Giant.</p>
      <section id="h2-20-combat">
        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>
          Trolls have no fear of death: They launch themselves into combat without hesitation, flailing wildly at the
          closest opponent. Even when confronted with fire, they try to get around the flames and attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>찢기 (범):</strong> If a troll hits with both claw attacks, it latches onto the opponent’s body and
          tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an additional 2d6+9 points of damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>재생 (범):</strong> Fire and acid deal normal damage to a troll. If a troll loses a limb or body part,
          the lost portion regrows in 3d6 minutes. The creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it
          to the stump.

          them relentlessly. These troll hunters are fearsome rangers who focus on slaying and devouring humanoid prey.

        A typical adult unicorn grows to 8 feet in length, stands 5 feet high at the shoulder, and weighs 1,200 pounds.

          Unicorns normally attack only when defending themselves or their forests. They either charge, impaling foes
          with their horns like lances, or strike with their hooves. The horn is a +3 magic weapon, though its power

          A unicorn can use <i>cure light wounds</i> three times per day and <i>cure moderate wounds</i> once per day
          (caster level 5th) by touching a wounded creature with its horn. Once per day it can use
          <i>neutralize poison</i> (DC 21, caster level 8th) with a touch of its horn. The save DC is Charisma-based.

      <h1>뱀파이어</h1>
      <p>
        Vampires appear just as they did in life, although their features are often hardened and feral, with the
        predatory look of wolves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like liches, they often embrace finery and decadence and may assume the guise of nobility. Despite their human
        appearance, vampires can be easily recognized, for they cast no shadows and throw no reflections in mirrors.
      </p>
      <p>Vampires speak any languages they knew in life.</p>
      <section id="h2-30-creating-a-vampire">
        <h2>뱀파이어 만들기</h2>
        <p>
          “Vampire” is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid or monstrous humanoid creature (referred
          to hereafter as the base creature).
        </p>
        <p>A vampire uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>크기와 유형:</strong> The creature’s type changes to undead (augmented humanoid or monstrous
          humanoid). Do not recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged.
        </p>
        <p><strong>히트 다이스:</strong> Increase all current and future Hit Dice to d12s.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>속도:</strong> Same as the base creature. If the base creature has a swim speed, the vampire retains
          the ability to swim and is not vulnerable to immersion in running water (see below).
        </p>
        <p><strong>방어도:</strong> The base creature’s natural armor bonus improves by +6.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>공격:</strong> A vampire retains all the attacks of the base creature and also gains a slam attack if
          it didn’t already have one. If the base creature can use weapons, the vampire retains this ability. A creature
          with natural weapons retains those natural weapons. A vampire fighting without weapons uses either its slam
          attack or its primary natural weapon (if it has any). A vampire armed with a weapon uses its slam or a weapon,
          as it desires.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>전력 공격:</strong> A vampire fighting without weapons uses either its slam attack (see above) or its
          natural weapons (if it has any). If armed with a weapon, it usually uses the weapon as its primary attack
          along with a slam or other natural weapon as a natural secondary attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>피해:</strong> Vampires have slam attacks. If the base creature does not have this attack form, use
          the appropriate damage value from the table below according to the vampire’s size. Creatures that have other
          kinds of natural weapons retain their old damage values or use the appropriate value from the table below,
          whichever is better.

          bat swarms, or a pack of 3d6 wolves as a standard action. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power
          might summon other creatures of similar power.) These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for
          up to 1 hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><i>지배 (초):</i></strong
          >A vampire can crush an opponent’s will just by looking onto his or her eyes. This is similar to a gaze
          attack, except that the vampire must use a standard action, and those merely looking at it are not affected.
          Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly under the vampire’s influence as
          though by a <i>dominate person</i> spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet.

        </p>
        <p>
          If the vampire instead drains the victim’s Constitution to 0 or lower, the victim returns as a spawn if it had
          4 or less HD and as a vampire if it had 5 or more HD. In either case, the new vampire or spawn is under the
          command of the vampire that created it and remains enslaved until its master’s destruction. At any given time
          a vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that
          would exceed this limit are created as free-willed vampires or vampire spawn. A vampire that is enslaved may
          create and enslave spawn of its own, so a master vampire can control a number of lesser vampires in this
          fashion. A vampire may voluntarily free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a
          vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again.

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>특성:</strong> A vampire retains all the special qualities of the base creature and gains those
          described below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>형태 대체 (초):</em> A vampire can assume the shape of a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard
          action. This ability is similar to a <i>polymorph</i> spell cast by a 12th-level character, except that the
          vampire does not regain hit points for changing form and must choose from among the forms mentioned here.
          While in its alternate form, the vampire loses its natural slam attack and dominate ability, but it gains the
          natural weapons and extraordinary special attacks of its new form. It can remain in that form until it assumes
          another or until the next sunrise. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might allow other
          forms.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>피해 축소 (초):</em> A vampire has damage reduction 10/silver and magic. A vampire’s natural weapons are
          treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>빠른 치료 (범):</em> A vampire heals 5 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point.
          If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, it automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. It must
          reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to nine miles in 2 hours.) Any
          additional damage dealt to a vampire forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest in its coffin, a
          vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at
          the rate of 5 hit points per round.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>기체 형태 (초):</em> As a standard action, a vampire can assume gaseous form at will as the spell (caster
          level 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect
          maneuverability.
        </p>
        <p><em>저항 (범):</em> A vampire has resistance to cold 10 and electricity 10.</p>
        <p>
          <em>거미 기어오르기 (범):</em> A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though with a <i>spider climb</i> spell.
        </p>
        <p><em>구마 저항 (범):</em> A vampire has +4 turn resistance.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>능력:</strong> Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As
          an undead creature, a vampire has no Constitution score.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>스킬:</strong> Vampires have a +8 racial bonus on Bluff, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search, Sense
          Motive, and Spot checks. Otherwise same as the base creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>특기:</strong> Vampires gain Alertness, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Improved Initiative, and Lightning
          Reflexes, assuming the base creature meets the prerequisites and doesn’t already have these feats.
        </p>
        <p><strong>환경:</strong> Any, usually same as base creature.</p>
        <p><strong>집단:</strong> Solitary, pair, gang (3–5), or troupe (1–2 plus 2–5 vampire spawn)</p>
        <p><strong>도전 지수:</strong> Same as the base creature +2.</p>
        <p><strong>전리품:</strong> Double standard.</p>

        <section id="h4-31-vampire-weaknesses">
          <h4>뱀파이어의 약점</h4>
          <p>For all their power, vampires have a number of weaknesses.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>뱀파이어 퇴치:</strong> Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an
            area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from a mirror or a strongly presented holy symbol. These things
            don’t harm the vampire—they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from a
            creature holding the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against the creature
            holding the item for the rest of the encounter. Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vampires are also unable to cross running water, although they can be carried over it while resting in their
            coffins or aboard a ship.
          </p>
          <p>
            They are utterly unable to enter a home or other building unless invited in by someone with the authority to
            do so. They may freely enter public places, since these are by definition open to all.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>뱀파이어 도살:</strong> Reducing a vampire’s hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn’t
            always destroy it (see the note on fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any
            vampire to direct sunlight disorients it: It can take only a single move action or attack action and is
            destroyed utterly in the next round if it cannot escape. Similarly, immersing a vampire in running water
            robs it of one-third of its hit points each round until it is destroyed at the end of the third round of
            immersion. Driving a wooden stake through a vampire’s heart instantly slays the monster. However, it returns
            to life if the stake is removed, unless the body is destroyed. A popular tactic is to cut off the creature’s
            head and fill its mouth with holy wafers (or their equivalent).

          <h4>뱀파이어 캐릭터</h4>
          <p>
            Vampires are always evil, which causes characters of certain classes to lose some class abilities. In
            addition, certain classes take additional penalties.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>사제:</strong> Vampire clerics lose their ability to turn undead but gain the ability to rebuke
            undead. This ability does not affect the vampire’s controller or any other vampires that a master controls.
            A vampire cleric has access to two of the following domains: Chaos, Destruction, Evil, or Trickery.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>소서러 및 마법사:</strong> Vampire sorcerers and wizards retain their class abilities, but if a
            character has a familiar other than a rat or bat, the link between them is broken, and the familiar shuns
            its former companion. The character can summon another familiar, but it must be a rat or bat.

        Vampire spawn are undead creatures that come into being when vampires slay mortals. Like their creators, spawn
        remain bound to their coffins and to the soil of their graves. Vampire spawn appear much as they did in life,
        although their features are often hardened, with a predatory look.
      </p>
      <p>Vampire spawn speak Common.</p>
      <section id="h2-34-combat">
        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>
          Vampire spawn use their inhuman strength when engaging mortals, hammering their foes with powerful blows and
          dashing them against rocks or walls. They also use their gaseous form and flight abilities to strike where
          opponents are most vulnerable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>피 흡수 (범):</strong> A vampire spawn can suck blood from a living victim with its fangs by making a
          successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each
          round. On each such successful drain attack, the vampire spawn gains 5 temporary hit pints.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>지배 (초):</strong> A vampire spawn can crush an opponent’s will just by looking onto his or her eyes.
          This is similar to a gaze attack, except that the vampire must take a standard action, and those merely
          looking at it are not affected. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or fall instantly
          under the vampire’s influence as though by a <i>dominate person</i> spell from a 5thlevel caster. The ability
          has a range of 30 feet. The save DC is Charisma-based.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>에너지 흡수 (초):</strong> Living creatures hit by a vampire spawn’s slam attack gain one negative
          level. The DC is 14 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based. For each
          such negative level bestowed, the vampire spawn gains 5 temporary hit points.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>빠른 치료 (범):</strong> A vampire spawn heals 2 points of damage each round so long as it has at
          least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, it automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to
          escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to nine miles
          in 2 hours.) Once at rest in its coffin, it is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no
          longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 2 hit points per round.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>기체 형태 (초):</strong> As a standard action, a vampire spawn can assume <i>gaseous form</i> at will
          as the spell (caster level 6th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with
          perfect maneuverability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>거미 기어오르기 (범):</strong> A vampire spawn can climb sheer surfaces as though with a
          <i>spider climb</i> spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>스킬:</strong> Vampire spawn have a +4 racial bonus on Bluff, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search,
          Sense Motive, and Spot checks.

        A vargouille is slightly larger than a human head, about 18 inches high, with a wingspan of 4 feet. It weighs
        about 10 pounds.
      </p>
      <p>Vargouilles speak Infernal.</p>
      <section id="h2-37-combat">
        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>
          Vargouilles attack by biting with their jagged teeth. Their special attacks make them even more dangerous. A
          vargouille’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of
          overcoming damage reduction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>비명 (초):</strong> Instead of biting, a vargouille can open its distended mouth and let out a
          terrible shriek. Those within 60 feet (except other vargouilles) who hear the shriek and can clearly see the
          creature must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed with fear for 2d4 rounds or until the monster
          attacks them, goes out of range, or leaves their sight. A paralyzed creature is susceptible to the
          vargouille’s kiss (see below). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same
          vargouille’s shriek for 24 hours. The shriek is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is
          Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>키스 (초):</strong> A vargouille can kiss a paralyzed target with a successful melee touch attack. An
          affected opponent must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or begin a terrible transformation that turns the
          creature into a vargouille within 24 hours (and often much sooner; roll 1d6 separately for each phase of the
          transformation).
        </p>
        <p>
          First, over a period of 1d6 hours, all the victim’s hair falls out. Within another 1d6 hours thereafter, the
          ears grow into leathery wings, tentacles sprout on the chin and scalp, and the teeth become long, pointed
          fangs. During the next 1d6 hours, the victim takes Intelligence drain and Charisma drain equal to 1 point per
          hour (to a minimum of 3). The transformation is complete 1d6 hours later, when the head breaks free of the
          body (which promptly dies) and becomes a vargouille. This transformation is interrupted by sunlight, and even
          a <i>daylight</i> spell can delay death, but to reverse the transformation requires <i>remove disease</i>. The
          save DC is Constitution-based and
        </p>
        <p>includes a +4 racial bonus.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>독 (범):</strong> Injury, Fortitude DC 12 or be unable to heal the vargouille’s bite damage naturally
          or magically. A <i>neutralize poison</i> or <i>heal</i> spell removes the effect, while
          <i>delay poison</i> allows magical healing. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.

        A wight’s appearance is a weird and twisted reflection of the form it had in life. A wight is about the height
        and weight of a human.

          <strong>스폰 생성 (초):</strong> Any humanoid slain by a wight becomes a wight in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under
          the command of the wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the

        Will-o’-wisps can be yellow, white, green, or blue. They are easily mistaken for lanterns, especially in the
        foggy marshes and swamps where they reside. A will-o’-wisp’s body is a globe of spongy material about 1 foot
        across and weighing about 3 pounds, and its glowing body sheds as much light as a torch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Will-o’-wisps speak Common and Auran. They have no vocal apparatus but can vibrate to create a voice with a
        ghostly sound.

        <p>
          Will-o’-wisps usually avoid combat. They prefer to confuse and bewilder adventurers, luring them into morasses
          or other hazardous places. When they are forced to fight, they loose small electrical shocks, which act as
          melee touch attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>마법 면역 (범):</strong> A will-o’-wisp is immune to most spells or spell-like abilities that allow
          spell resistance, except <i>magic missile</i> and <i>maze.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>선천적 투명화 (범):</strong> A startled or frightened will-o’-wisp can extinguish its glow,
          effectively becoming invisible as the spell.

          Winter wolves typically hunt in packs. Their size, cunning, and formidable breath weapon allow them to hunt
          and kill creatures much larger than themselves. A pack usually circles an opponent, each wolf attacking in
          turn to exhaust it. If they’re in a hurry, white wolves try to pin their foes.

          <strong>빙결의 이빨 (초):</strong> A winter wolf deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage every time it bites
          an opponent, as if its bite were a frost weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>넘어뜨리기 (범):</strong> A winter wolf that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent
          (+8 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If
          the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the winter wolf.

          <strong>스킬:</strong> Winter wolves have a +1 racial bonus on Listen, Move Silently, and Spot checks. Winter
          wolves have a +2 racial bonus on Hide checks. *Their natural coloration grants them a +7 racial bonus on Hide
          checks in areas of snow and ice. A winter wolf has a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by

        A typical worg has gray or black fur, grows to 5 feet long and stands 3 feet tall at the shoulder. It weighs 300
        pounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        More intelligent than their smaller cousins, worgs speak their own language. Some can also speak Common and
        Goblin.

          Mated pairs or packs work together to bring down large game, while lone worgs usually chase down creatures
          smaller than themselves. Both often use hit-and-run tactics to exhaust their quarry. A pack usually circles a
          larger opponent: Each wolf attacks in turn, biting and retreating, until the creature is exhausted, at which
          point the pack moves in for the kill. If they get impatient or heavily outnumber the opponent, worgs attempt
          to pin it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>넘어뜨리기 (범):</strong> A worg that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+3
          check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the
          attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the worg.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>스킬:</strong> A worg has a +1 racial bonus on Listen, Move Silently, and Spot checks, and a +2 racial
          bonus on Hide checks. *A worg has a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking

        Wraiths are incorporeal creatures born of evil and darkness. In some cases, the grim silhouette of a wraith
        might appear armored or outfitted with weapons. This appearance does not affect the creature’s AC or combat
        abilities but only reflects the shape it had in life.
      </p>
      <p>
        A wraith is about as tall as a human, while a dread wraith is roughly the size of an ogre. Since both are
        incorporeal, they are weightless.
      </p>
      <p>Wraiths speak Common and Infernal.</p>
      <section id="h2-47-combat">
        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>Both the wraith and the dread wraith share the following abilities.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>비자연적 오라 (초):</strong> Animals, whether wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence
          of a wraith at a distance of 30 feet. They will not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to
          do so; they remain panicked as long as they are within that range.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>햇살에 무기력함 (범):</strong> Wraiths are utterly powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a
          <i>daylight</i> spell) and flee from it.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="h2-48-wraith">
        <h2>망령</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>건강 흡수 (초):</strong> Living creatures hit by a wraith’s incorporeal touch attack must succeed on a
          DC 14 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain. The save DC is Charisma-based. On each such
          successful attack, the wraith gains 5 temporary hit points.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>스폰 생성 (초):</strong> Any humanoid slain by a wraith becomes a wraith in 1d4 rounds. Its body
          remains intact and inanimate, but its spirit is torn free from its corpse and transformed. Spawn are under the
          command of the wraith that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the
          abilities they had in life.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="h2-49-dread-wraith">
        <h2>공포의 망령</h2>
        <p>
          The oldest and most malevolent wraiths lurk in the depths of forgotten temples and other forsaken places. They
          can sense the approach of living creatures, and hunger for them. Despite its size, the dread wraith possesses
          unearthly quickness, and makes use of its Spring Attack feat and natural reach to strike with deadly effect
          and melt back into the shadows—or the walls.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>생명감지 (초):</strong> A dread wraith notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if
          it possessed the blindsight ability. It also senses the strength of their life force automatically, as if it
          had cast <i>deathwatch.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>건강 흡수 (초):</strong> Living creatures hit by a dread wraith’s incorporeal touch attack must
          succeed on a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 1d8 points of Constitution drain. The save DC is Charisma-based. On
          each such successful attack, the dread wraith gains 5 temporary hit points.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>스폰 생성 (초):</strong> Any humanoid slain by a dread wraith becomes a wraith in 1d4 rounds. Its body
          remains intact and inanimate, but its spirit is torn free from its corpse and transformed. Spawn are under the
          command of the wraith that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the

        A distant cousin to the true dragons, the wyvern is a huge flying lizard with a poisonous stinger in its tail.
      </p>
      <p>
        A wyvern’s body is 15 feet long, and dark brown to gray; half that length is tail. Its wingspan is about 20
        feet. A wyvern weighs about one ton.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wyverns speak Draconic, but usually don’t bother with anything more elaborate than a loud hiss or a
        deep-throated growl much like that of a bull alligator.
      </p>
      <section id="h2-51-combat">
        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>
          Wyverns are rather stupid but always aggressive: They attack nearly anything that isn’t obviously more
          powerful than themselves. A wyvern dives from the air, snatching the opponent with its talons and stinging it
          to death. A wyvern can slash with its talons only when making a flyby attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>향상된 잡아채기 (범):</strong> To use this ability, a wyvern must hit with its talons. It can then
          attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
          check, it establishes a hold and stings.

      <p>A xill stands 4 to 5 feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds. Xills speak Infernal.</p>
      <section id="h2-53-combat">
        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>
          Xills are dangerous opponents, attacking with all four limbs. More civilized ones use weapons, usually
          fighting with two at a time so as to leave two claws free for grab attacks. Xills typically lie in wait on the
          Ethereal Plane for suitable prey to happen by, then ambush it using their planewalk ability. They make full
          use of their Tumble skill in combat: Usually, one or two distract physically powerful enemies by attacking,
          then assuming a defensive stance while their fellows maneuver to advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>주입하기 (범):</strong> As a standard action, a xill can lay eggs inside a paralyzed creature. The
          young emerge about 90 days later, literally devouring the host from inside. A <i>remove disease</i> spell rids
          a victim of the egg, as does a DC 25 Heal check. If the check fails, the healer can try again, but each
          attempt (successful or not) deals 1d4 points of damage to the patient.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>향상된 잡아채기 (범):</strong> To use this ability, a xill must hit with one or more claw attacks. It
          can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. It receives a
          +2 bonus on the grapple check for each claw that hits. If it wins the grapple check and maintains the hold in
          the next round, it automatically bites the foe at that time. The bite deals no damage but injects a paralyzing
          venom.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>마비 (범):</strong> Those bitten by a xill must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for
          1d4 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>이세계보행 (초):</strong> These planar travelers like to slip between the folds of space to attack
          enemies as though from thin air. They can cross from the Ethereal Plane with a move action but take 2 rounds
          to cross back, during which time they are immobile. As a xill fades away, it becomes harder to hit: Opponents
          have a 20% miss chance in
        </p>
        <p>
          the first round and a 50% miss chance in the second. A xill can planewalk with a willing or helpless creature.

        Minor xorns are about 3 feet tall and wide and weigh about 120 pounds. Average xorns are about 5 feet tall and
        wide, weighing about 600 pounds. Elder xorns are about 8 feet tall and wide and weigh about 9,000 pounds.

        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>
          Xorns do not attack fleshly beings except to defend themselves or their property, since they cannot digest
          meat. Xorns are indifferent to creatures of the Material Plane—with the sole exception of anyone carrying a
          significant amount of precious metals or minerals, which xorns eat. They can smell food up to 20 feet away. A
          xorn can be quite aggressive when seeking food, especially on the Material Plane, where such sustenance is
          harder to find than it is on its native plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          A xorn’s favorite mode of attack is to wait just beneath a stone surface until a foe comes within reach, then
          emerge suddenly. Groups of xorns often send one of their number to the surface to negotiate for food while the
          remainder position themselves for a surprise attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>전방위 시야 (범):</strong> A xorn’s symmetrically placed eyes allow it to look in any direction,
          providing a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Search checks. A xorn can’t be flanked.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>대지 글라이드 (범):</strong> A xorn can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth
          except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does
          it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A <i>move earth</i> spell cast on an area containing a
          burrowing xorn flings the xorn back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15
          Fortitude save.

          Yeth hounds hunt only at night. They fear the sun and never venture out in daylight, even if their lives
          depend on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          A yeth hound’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose
          of overcoming damage reduction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>으르렁 거리기 (초):</strong> When a yeth hound howls or barks, all creatures except other evil
          outsiders within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 11 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This
          is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune
          to the same hound’s bay for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>넘어뜨리기 (범):</strong> A yeth hound that hits with its bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent
          (+3 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If
          the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the yeth hound.
        </p>
        <p><strong>비행 (초):</strong> A yeth hound can cease or resume flight as a free action.</p>

        A yrthak is blind. It senses sound and movement by means of a special organ on its long tongue. It emits
        powerfully focused beams of sound from the protrusion on its head. The creature is a yellowish-green color, with
        the wings and fin being more yellow and the head and body more green. The teeth are yellow.
      </p>
      <p>A yrthak is about 20 feet long, with a wingspan of 40 feet. It weighs about 5,000 pounds.</p>
      <p>Despite their intelligence, yrthaks do not speak.</p>

          A yrthak prefers to attack from the air, strafing the ground with sonic attacks or snatching up and dropping
          prey.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>음파 랜스 (초):</strong> Once every 2 rounds, a yrthak can focus sonic energy in a ray up to 60 feet
          long. This is a ranged touch attack that deals 6d6 points of damage to a single target.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>폭파 (초):</strong> A yrthak can fire its sonic lance at the ground, a large rock, a stone wall, or
          the like to create an explosion of shattered stone. This attack deals 2d6 points of piercing damage to all
          within 10 feet of the effect’s center. This counts as a use of the sonic lance attack and thus is usable only
          once every 2 rounds, and never on the round following a sonic lance attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>비시각적시야 (범):</strong> A yrthak can ascertain all foes within 120 feet. Beyond that range it is
          considered blinded. Yrthaks are invulnerable to gaze attacks, visual effects of spells such as illusions, and
          other attack forms that rely on sight. A yrthak whose sense of hearing is impaired is effectively blinded,
          treating all targets as having total concealment.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>면역:</strong> Yrthaks have immunity to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack
          forms that rely on sight.

          <strong>히트 다이스:</strong> Drop any Hit Dice from class levels (to a minimum of 1), double the number of
          Hit Dice left, and raise them to d12s. If the base creature has more than 10 Hit Dice (not counting those
          gained with experience), it can’t be made into a zombie with the <i>animate dead</i> spell.
