      <div class="original-headline">MAGIC OVERVIEW</div>
      <p>
        A spell is a one-time magical effect. 주문 come in two types: arcane (cast by 음유시인, 소서러, and 마법사) and
        신성(cast by 사제, 드루이드, and experienced 성기사 and 레인저). Some spellcasters select their 주문 from a
        limited list of 주문 known, while others have access to a wide variety of options.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most spellcasters prepare their 주문 in advance—whether from a spellbook or through devout 기도 and meditation—
        while some cast 주문 spontaneously without preparation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite these different ways that characters use to learn or prepare their 주문, when it comes to casting them,
        주문 are very much alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cutting across the categories of arcane and 신성 주문 are the eight 학파 of magic. These 학파 represent the
        different ways that 주문 take effect.
      </p>

        <h2>주문 시전하기</h2>
        <div class="original-headline">CASTING SPELLS</div>
        <p>
          Whether a spell is arcane or 신성, and whether a character prepares 주문 in advance or chooses them on the
          감지, casting a spell works the same way.
        </p>
        <section id="h3-2-choosing-a-spell">
          <h3>주문 선택하기</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">CHOOSING A SPELL</div>
          <p>
            First you must choose which spell to cast. If you’re a 사제, 드루이드, experienced 성기사, experienced
            레인저, or 마법사, you select from among 주문 prepared earlier in the day and not yet cast (see 마법사 주문
            준비 and 신성 주문 준비).
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re a 음유시인 or 소서러, you can select any spell you know, provided you are capable of 주문 시전하기
            of that 레벨 or higher.
          </p>
          <p>
            To 주문 시전, you must be able to 말하기(if the spell has a verbal component), gesture (if it has a somatic
            component), and manipulate the material 구성요소 or focus (if any). Additionally, you must concentrate to
            주문 시전.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a spell has multiple versions, you choose which version to use when you cast it. You don’t have to
            prepare (or learn, in the case of a 음유시인 or 소서러) a specific version of the spell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you’ve cast a prepared spell, you can’t cast it again until you prepare it again. (If you’ve prepared
            multiple copies of a single spell, you can cast each copy once.) If you’re a 음유시인 or 소서러, casting a
            spell counts against your daily limit for 주문 of that spell 레벨, but you can cast the same spell again if
            you haven’t reached your limit.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="h3-3-concentration">
          <h3>집중</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">CONCENTRATION</div>
          <p>
            To 주문 시전, you must concentrate. If something interrupts your 집중 while you’re casting, you must make a
            집중 check or lose the spell. The more distracting the interruption and the higher 레벨 of the spell you are
            trying to cast, the higher the DC is. If you fail the check, you lose the spell just as if you had cast it
            to no effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Injury:</b><span>
              If while trying to 주문 시전 you take 피해, you must make a 집중 check (DC 10 + points of 피해 taken + the
              레벨 of the spell you’re casting). If you fail the check, you lose the spell without effect. The
              interrupting event strikes during spellcasting if it comes between when you start and when you complete a
              spell (for a spell with a 시전 시간 of 1 full round or more) or if it comes in response to your casting
              the spell (such as an 공격 of opportunity provoked by the spell or a contingent 공격, such as a readied
              action).</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are taking continuous 피해 half 피해 is considered to take place while you are casting a spell. You
            must make a 집중 check (DC 10 + 1/2 피해 that the continuous source last dealt + 레벨 of the spell you’re
            casting). If the last 피해 dealt was the last 피해 that the effect could deal then 피해 is over, and it does
            not 주의산만 you.
          </p>
          <p>Repeated 피해 does not count as continuous 피해.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Spell: </b><span>If you are affected by a spell while attempting to 주문 시전 of your own, you must make a 집중 check or
              lose the spell you are casting. If the spell affecting you deals 피해, the DC is 10 + points of 피해 + the
              레벨 of the spell you’re casting.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If the spell interferes with you or 주의산만 you in some other way, the DC is the spell의 내성 굴림 DC + the
            레벨 of the spell you’re casting. For a spell with no 내성 굴림, it의 the DC that the spell의 내성 굴림
            would have if a save were allowed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Grappling or Pinned:</b><span>
              The only 주문 you can cast while grappling or pinned are those without somatic 구성요소 and whose material
              구성요소(if any) you have in hand. Even so, you must make a 집중 check (DC 20 + 레벨 of the spell you’re
              casting) or lose the spell.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Vigorous Motion:</b><span>
              If you are riding on a moving 탈것 소환, taking a bouncy 탑승 in a wagon, on a small boat in rough water,
              below-decks in a storm-tossed ship, or simply being jostled in a similar fashion, you must make a 집중
              check (DC 10 + 레벨 of the spell you’re casting) or lose the spell.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Violent Motion: </b><span>If you are on a galloping 말, taking a very rough 탑승 in a wagon, on a small boat in rapids or in a
              storm, on deck in a storm-tossed ship, or being tossed roughly about in a similar fashion, you must make a
              집중 check (DC 15 + 레벨 of the spell you’re casting) or lose the spell.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Violent 날씨: </b><span>You must make a 집중 check if you try to 주문 시전 in violent 날씨. If you are in a high wind carrying
              blinding rain or sleet, the DC is 5 + 레벨 of the spell you’re casting. If you are in wind-driven hail,
              dust, or debris, the DC is 10 + 레벨 of the spell you’re casting. In either case, you lose the spell if
              you fail 집중 check. If 날씨 is caused by a spell, use the rules in the Spell subsection above.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Casting Defensively:</b><span>
              If you want to 주문 시전 without provoking any 기회 공격, you must make a 집중 check (DC 15 + 레벨 of the
              spell you’re casting) to succeed. You lose the spell if you fail.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Entangled:</b><span>
              If you want to 주문 시전 while entangled in a net or by a tanglefoot bag or while you’re affected by a
              spell with similar effects, you must make a DC 15 집중 check to cast the spell. You lose the spell if you
              fail.</span>

          <h3>주문 무효화</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">COUNTERSPELLS</div>
          <p>
            It is possible to cast any spell as a counterspell. By doing so, you are using the spell의 energy to disrupt
            the casting of the same spell by another character. Counterspelling works even if one spell is 신성 and the
            other arcane.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>How 주문 무효화 Work: </b><span>To use a counterspell, you must select an opponent as the target of the counterspell. You do this by
              choosing 준비 action. In doing so, you elect to wait to complete your action until your opponent tries to
              주문 시전. (You may still 이동 your 속도, since 준비 is a standard action.)</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If the target of your counterspell tries to 주문 시전, make a 주문학 check (DC 15 + the spell의 레벨). This
            check is a free action. If the check succeeds, you correctly 식별 the opponent의 spell and can attempt to
            counter it. If the check fails, you can’t do either of these things.
          </p>
          <p>
            To complete the action, you must then cast the correct spell. As a general rule, a spell can only counter
            itself. If you are able to cast the same spell and you have it prepared (if you prepare 주문), you cast it,
            altering it slightly to create a counterspell effect. If the target is within 거리, both 주문 automatically
            negate each other with no other results.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Counterspelling 메타마법 주문:</b><span> 메타마법 특기 are not taken into account when determining whether a spell can be countered</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Specific Exceptions:</b><span>
              Some 주문 specifically counter each other, especially when they have diametrically opposed effects.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 700">마법 무효화 </span><b>as a Counterspell:</b><span>
              You can use <i>마법 무효화 </i>to counterspell another spellcaster, and
              you don’t need to 식별 the spell he or she is casting. However,
              <i>마법 무효화 </i>doesn’t always work as a counterspell (see the spell
              묘사).</span>

          <h3>시전자 레벨</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">CASTER LEVEL</div>
          <p>
            A spell의 power often depends on its 시전자 레벨, which for most spellcasting characters is equal to your
            직업 레벨 in the class you’re using to cast the spell.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can 주문 시전 at a lower 시전자 레벨 than normal, but 시전자 레벨 you choose must be high enough for you
            to cast the spell in question, and all 레벨-dependent features must be based on the same 시전자 레벨.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event that a class feature, domain granted power, or other special ability provides an adjustment to
            your 시전자 레벨, that adjustment applies not only to effects based on 시전자 레벨(such as 거리, 지속시간,
            and 피해 dealt) but also to your 시전자 레벨 check to overcome your target의 주문 저항 and to 시전자 레벨
            used in dispel checks (both the dispel check and the DC of the check).

            If you ever try to 주문 시전 in 상태이상 where the characteristics of the spell cannot be made to conform,
            the casting fails and the spell is wasted.
          </p>
          <p>
            주문 also fail if your 집중 is broken and might fail if you’re wearing 갑옷 while casting a spell with

          <div class="original-headline">SPECIAL SPELL EFFECTS</div>
          <p>
            Many 특수 주문 효과 are handled according to 학파 of 주문 in question Certain other special spell features
            are found across spell 학파.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>공격:</b><span>
              Some 주문 설명 refer to attacking. All offensive 전투 actions, even those that don’t 피해 opponents are
              considered 공격. Attempts to 언데드 퇴치 count as 공격. All 주문 that opponents resist with 내성 굴림,
              that deal 피해, or that otherwise 해악 or hamper subjects are 공격. 주문 that summon 몬스터 or other
              allies are not 공격 because 주문 themselves don’t 해악 anyone.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>보너스 Types:</b><span>
              Usually, 보너스 has a type that indicates how the spell grants 보너스. The important aspect of 보너스
              types is that two 보너스 of the same type don’t generally stack. With the exception of 회피 보너스, most
              circumstance 보너스, and racial 보너스, only the better 보너스 works (see 주문 효과 조합하기, below). The
              same principle applies to 페널티—a character taking two or more 페널티 of the same type applies only the
              worst one.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Bringing Back 죽음:</b><span> Several 주문 have the power to restore slain characters to life.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            When a living creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves 물질 세계, travels through 영적 세계, and
            goes to abide on the plane where the creature의 deity resides. If the creature did not worship a deity, its
            soul departs to the plane corresponding to its 성향. Bringing someone back from 죽음 means retrieving his or
            her soul and returning it to his or her body.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>레벨 손실: </i><span>Any creature brought back to life usually loses one 레벨 of experience. The character의 new XP total is
              midway between the minimum needed for his or her new (reduced) 레벨 and the minimum needed for the next
              one. If the character was 1 레벨 at the time of death, he or she loses 2 points of 건강 instead of losing
              a 레벨.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            This 레벨 손실 or 건강 loss cannot be repaired by any mortal means, even
            <i>소원 </i>or <i>기적. </i>A revived
            character can regain a lost 레벨 by earning XP through further adventuring. A revived character who was 1
            레벨 at the time of death can regain lost points of 건강 by improving his or her 건강 score when he or she
            attains a 레벨 that allows an ability score increase.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Preventing Revivification: </i><span>Enemies can take steps to make it more difficult for a character to be returned from 죽음. Keeping the
              body prevents others from using <i>시체 되살리기 </i>or
              <i>부활 </i>to restore the slain character to life. Casting
              <i>영혼의 덫 </i>prevents any sort of revivification unless the soul is
              first released.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Revivification against One의 Will: </i><span>A soul cannot be returned to life if it does not 소원 to be. A soul knows 이름, 성향, and patron deity
              (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and may refuse to return on that basis.</span>

          <h3>주문 효과 조합하기</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">COMBINING MAGICAL EFFECTS</div>
          <p>
            주문 or magical effects usually work as described, no matter how many other 주문 or magical effects happen
            to be operating in the same 범위 or on the same recipient. Except in special cases, a spell does not affect
            the way another spell operates. Whenever a spell has a specific effect on other 주문, the spell 묘사
            explains that effect. Several other general rules apply when 주문 or magical effects operate in the same
            place:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Stacking Effects:</b><span>
              주문 that provide 보너스 or 페널티 on 명중 굴림, 피해 rolls, 내성 굴림, and other attributes usually do
              not stack with themselves. More generally, two 보너스 of the same type don’t stack even if they come from
              different 주문(or from effects other than 주문; see 보너스 Types, above).
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Different 보너스 이름: </i><span>보너스 or 페널티 from two different 주문 stack if the 수정치 are of different types. 보너스 that isn’t
              named stacks with any 보너스.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Same Effect More than Once in Different 근력: </i><span>In cases when two or more identical 주문 are operating in the same 범위 or on the same target, but at
              different 근력, only the best one applies.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Same Effect with Differing Results: </i><span>The same spell can sometimes produce varying effects if applied to the same recipient more than once.
              Usually the last spell in the series trumps the others. None of the previous 주문 are actually removed or
              dispelled, but their effects become irrelevant while the final spell in the series lasts.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>One Effect Makes Another Irrelevant: </i><span>Sometimes, one spell can render a later spell irrelevant. Both 주문 are still active, but one has
              rendered the other useless in some fashion.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Multiple Mental Control Effects: </i><span>Sometimes magical effects that establish mental control render each other irrelevant, such as a spell
              that removes the subjects ability to act. Mental controls that don’t remove the recipient의 ability to act
              usually do not interfere with each other. If a creature is under the mental control of two or more
              creatures, it tends to obey each to the best of its ability, and to the extent of the control each effect
              allows. If the controlled creature receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the competing controllers
              must make opposed 매력 checks to determine which one the creature obeys.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>주문 with Opposite Effects:</b><span>
              주문 with opposite effects apply normally, with all 보너스, 페널티, or changes accruing in the order that
              they apply. Some 주문 negate or counter each other. This is a special effect that is noted in a spell의
              묘사.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Instantaneous Effects:</b><span>

          <p>
            Beneath the spell 이름 is a line giving 학파 of magic (and the subschool, if appropriate) that the spell
            belongs to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Almost every spell belongs to one of eight 학파 of magic. A 학파 of magic is a group of related 주문 that
            work in similar ways. A small number of 주문(<i>비전의 징표, 제한된 소원, 영구화, 요술, </i>and <i>소원</i>) are universal, belonging to no 학파.
          </p>
          <section id="h5-13-abjuration">
            <h5>회피술</h5>
            <div class="original-headline">Abjuration</div>
            <p>
              회피술 are protective 주문. They create physical or magical barriers, negate magical or physical 능력,
              해악 trespassers, or even banish the subject of the spell to another plane of existence.
            </p>
            <p>
              If one 회피술 spell is active within 10 feet of another for 24 hours or more, the magical fields interfere
              with each other and create barely visible energy fluctuations. The DC to find such 주문 with 탐색 skill
              drops by 4.
            </p>
            <p>
              If an 회피술 creates a barrier that keeps certain types of creatures at bay, that barrier cannot be used
              to push away those creatures. If you force the barrier against such a creature, you feel a discernible
              pressure against the barrier. If you continue to apply pressure, you end the spell.

            <h5>소환술</h5>
            <div class="original-headline">Conjuration</div>
            <p>
              Each 소환술 spell belongs to one of five subschools. 소환술 bring manifestations of objects, creatures, or
              some form of energy to you (the summoning subschool), actually 운송수단 creatures from another plane of
              existence to your plane (calling), 치료(치료), 운송수단 creatures or objects over great distances
              (teleportation), or 물체 생성 or effects on 감지(creation). Creatures you conjure usually, but not always,
              obey your 명령.
            </p>
            <p>
              A creature or object brought into being or transported to your location by a 소환술 spell cannot appear
              inside another creature or object, nor can it appear floating in an empty space. It must arrive in an open
              location on a surface capable of supporting it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The creature or object must appear within the spell의 거리, but it does not have to remain within the
              거리.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Calling:</b><span>
                A calling spell 운송수단 a creature from another plane to the plane you are on. The spell grants the
                creature the one-time ability to return to its plane of origin, although the spell may limit the
                circumstances under which this is possible. Creatures who are called actually die when they are killed;
                they do not disappear and reform, as do those brought by a summoning spell (see below). 지속시간 of a
                calling spell is instantaneous, which means that the called creature can’t be dispelled.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Creation: </b><span>A creation spell manipulates matter to create an object or creature in the place the spellcaster
                designates (subject to the limits noted above). If the spell has a 지속시간 other than instantaneous,
                magic holds the creation together, and when the spell ends, the conjured creature or object vanishes
                without a trace. If the spell has an instantaneous 지속시간, the created object or creature is merely
                assembled through magic. It lasts indefinitely and does not depend on magic for its existence.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>치료: </b><span>Certain 신성 소환술 치료 creatures or even bring them back to life.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Summoning:</b><span>
                A summoning spell instantly brings a creature or object to a place you designate. When the spell ends or
                is dispelled, a summoned creature is instantly sent back to where it came from, but a summoned object is
                not sent back unless the spell 묘사 specifically indicates this. A summoned creature also goes away if
                it is killed or if its 히트 포인트 drop to 0 or lower. It is not really 죽음. It takes 24 hours for the
                creature to reform, during which time it can’t be summoned again.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              When the spell that summoned a creature ends and the creature disappears, all 주문 it has cast expire. A
              summoned creature cannot use any innate summoning 능력 it may have, and it refuses to cast any 주문 that
              would cost it XP, or to use any 유사주문 능력 that would cost XP if they were 주문.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Teleportation:</b><span>
                A teleportation spell 운송수단 one or more creatures or objects a great distance. The most powerful of
                these 주문 can cross planar boundaries. Unlike summoning 주문, the transportation is (unless otherwise
                noted) one-way and not dispellable.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Teleportation is instantaneous travel through 영적 세계. Anything that blocks astral travel also blocks
              teleportation.

            <div class="original-headline">Divination</div>
            <p>
              점술 주문 enable you to learn secrets long forgotten, to predict the future, to find hidden things, and to
              foil deceptive 주문.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many 점술 주문 have cone-shaped 범위. These 이동 with you and extend in the direction you look. The cone
              defines 범위 that you can sweep each round. If you study the same 범위 for multiple rounds, you can often
              gain additional information, as noted in 설명 문구 for the spell.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>염탐:</b><span>
                A 염탐 spell creates an invisible magical sensor that sends you information. Unless noted otherwise, the
                sensor has the same powers of sensory acuity that you possess. This 레벨 of acuity includes any 주문 or
                effects that target you, but not 주문 or effects that emanate from you. However, the sensor is treated
                as a separate, independent sensory organ of yours, and thus it functions normally even if you have been
                blinded, deafened, or otherwise suffered sensory impairment.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Any creature with an 지능 score of 12 or higher can notice the sensor by making a DC 20 지능 check. The
              sensor can be dispelled as if it were an active spell.
            </p>
            <p>Lead sheeting or magical protection blocks a 염탐 spell, and you sense that the spell is so blocked.</p>

            <p>
              강신술 주문 manipulate energy or tap an unseen source of power to produce a desired end. In effect, they
              create something out of nothing. Many of these 주문 produce spectacular effects, and 강신술 주문 can deal
              large amounts of 피해.

            <p>
              환영술 주문 deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, not
              see things that are there, hear phantom noises, or remember things that never happened.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Figment:</b><span>
                A figment spell creates a false sensation. Those who perceive the figment perceive the same thing, not
                their own slightly different versions of the figment. (It is not a personalized mental impression.)
                Figments cannot make something seem to be something else. A figment that includes audible effects cannot
                duplicate intelligible speech unless the spell 묘사 specifically says it can. If intelligible speech is
                possible, it must be in a language you can 말하기. If you try to duplicate a language you cannot 말하기,
                the image produces gibberish. Likewise, you cannot make a visual copy of something unless you know what
                it looks like.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Because figments and glamers (see below) are unreal, they cannot produce real effects the way that other
              types of 환영술 can. They cannot cause 피해 to objects or creatures, support weight, provide nutrition, or
              provide protection from the elements. Consequently, these 주문 are useful for confounding or delaying
              foes, but useless for attacking them directly.
            </p>
            <p>A figment의 AC is equal to 10 + its size 수정치.</p>
            <p>
              <b>Glamer:</b><span>
                A glamer spell changes a subject의 sensory qualities, making it look, feel, taste, smell, or sound like
                something else, or even seem to disappear.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Pattern:</b><span>
                Like a figment, a pattern spell creates an image that others can see, but a pattern also affects the
                minds of those who see it or are caught in it. All patterns are 정신영향계 주문.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Phantasm: </b><span>A phantasm spell creates a mental image that usually only the caster and the subject (or subjects) of
                the spell can perceive. This impression is totally in the minds of the subjects. It is a personalized
                mental impression. (It의 all in their heads and not a fake picture or something that they actually see.)
                Third parties viewing or studying the scene don’t notice the phantasm. All phantasms are 마음에 영향을
                미치는 주문.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>어둠:</b><span>
                A 어둠 spell creates something that is partially real from extradimensional energy. Such 환영술 can have
                real effects. 피해 dealt by a 어둠 환영술 is real.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>내성 굴림 and 환영술(Disbelief ): </b><span>Creatures encountering an 환영술 usually do not receive 내성 굴림 to recognize it as illusory until
                they study it carefully or interact with it in some fashion.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              A successful 내성 굴림 against an 환영술 reveals it to be false, but a figment or phantasm remains as a
              translucent outline.
            </p>
            <p>
              A failed 내성 굴림 indicates that a character fails to notice something is amiss. A character faced with
              proof that an 환영술 isn’t real needs no 내성 굴림. If any viewer successfully disbelieves an 환영술 and
              communicates this fact to others, each such viewer gains a 내성 굴림 with a +4 보너스.

            Appearing on the same line as 학파 and subschool, when applicable, is a descriptor that further categorizes
            the spell in some way. Some 주문 have more than one descriptor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The descriptors are acid, air, chaotic, cold, 암흑, death, earth, electricity, evil, 공포, fire, force,

          </p>
          <p>
            Most of these descriptors have no game effect by themselves, but they govern how the spell interacts with

            relative power. This number is preceded by an abbreviation for the class whose members can cast the spell.
            레벨 entry also indicates whether a spell is a domain spell and, if so, what its domain and its 레벨 as a

          <div class="original-headline">COMPONENTS</div>
          <p>
            A spell의 구성요소 are what you must do or possess to cast it. 구성요소 entry in a spell 묘사 includes
            abbreviations that tell you what type of 구성요소 it has. Specifics for material, focus, and XP 구성요소 are
            given at the end of 설명 문구. Usually you don’t worry about 구성요소, but when you can’t use a component
            for some reason or when a material or focus component is expensive, then 구성요소 are important.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Verbal (V):</b><span>
              A verbal component is a spoken incantation. To provide a verbal component, you must be able to 말하기 in a
              strong voice. A <i>침묵 </i>spell or a gag spoils the incantation (and
              thus the spell). A spellcaster who has been deafened has a 20% chance to spoil any spell with a verbal
              component that he or she tries to cast.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Somatic (S):</b><span>
              A somatic component is a measured and precise 이동 of the hand. You must have at least one hand free to
              provide a somatic component.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Material (M):</b><span>
              A material component is one or more physical substances or objects that are annihilated by the spell
              energies in the casting process. Unless a cost is given for a material component, the cost is negligible.
              Don’t bother to keep 추적 of material 구성요소 with negligible cost. Assume you have all you need as long
              as you have your spell component pouch.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Focus (F): </b><span>A focus component is a prop of some sort. Unlike a material component, a focus is not consumed when the
              spell is cast and can be reused. As with material 구성요소, the cost for a focus is negligible unless a
              price is given. Assume that focus 구성요소 of negligible cost are in your spell component pouch.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>신성 Focus (DF):</b><span>
              A 신성 focus component is an item of spiritual significance. 신성 focus for a 사제 or a 성기사 is a holy
              symbol appropriate to the character의 faith.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If 구성요소 line includes F/DF or M/DF, the arcane version of the spell has a focus component or a material
            component (the abbreviation before the slash) and 신성 version has a 신성 focus component (the abbreviation
            after the slash).

            <b>XP Cost (XP):</b><span>
              Some powerful 주문 entail an 경험치 비용 to you. No spell can restore the XP lost in this manner. You
              cannot spend so much XP that you lose a 레벨, so you cannot cast the spell unless you have enough XP to
              spare. However, you may, on gaining enough XP to attain a new 레벨, use those XP for casting a spell
              rather than keeping them and advancing a 레벨. The XP are treated just like a material component—expended
              when you cast the spell, whether or not the casting succeeds.</span>

          <h3>시전 시간</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">CASTING TIME</div>
          <p>
            Most 주문 have a 시전 시간 of 1 standard action. Others take 1 round or more, while a few require only a
            free action.
          </p>
          <p>
            A spell that takes 1 round to cast is a full-round action. It comes into effect just before the beginning of
            your turn in the round after you began casting the spell. You then act normally after the spell is
            completed.
          </p>
          <p>
            A spell that takes 1 minute to cast comes into effect just before your turn 1 minute later (and for each of
            those 10 rounds, you are casting a spell as a full-round action, just as noted above for 1- round 시전
            시간). These actions must be consecutive and uninterrupted, or the spell automatically fails.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you begin a spell that takes 1 round or longer to cast, you must continue 집중 from the current round
            to just before your turn in the next round (at least). If you lose 집중 before the casting is complete, you
            lose the spell.
          </p>
          <p>
            A spell with a 시전 시간 of 1 free action doesn’t count against your normal limit of one spell per round.
            However, you may cast such a spell only once per round. Casting a spell with a 시전 시간 of 1 free action
            doesn’t provoke 기회 공격.

            You make all pertinent decisions about a spell (거리, target, 범위, effect, version, and so forth) when the

          <h3>거리</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">RANGE</div>
          <p>
            A spell의 거리 indicates how far from you it can reach, as defined in 거리 entry of the spell 묘사. A
            spell의 거리 is the maximum distance from you that the spell의 effect can occur, as well as the maximum
            distance at which you can designate the spell의 point of origin. If any portion of the spell의 범위 would
            extend beyond this 거리, that 범위 is wasted. Standard 거리 include the following.
          </p>
          <p><b>Personal:</b><span> The spell affects only you.</span></p>
          <p>
            <b>Touch:</b><span>
              You must touch a creature or object to affect it. A touch spell that deals 피해 can score a critical hit
              just as a weapon can. A touch spell threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double 피해
              on a successful critical hit. Some touch 주문 allow you to touch multiple targets. You can touch as many
              willing targets as you can reach as part of the casting, but all targets of the spell must be touched in
              the same round that you finish casting the spell.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Close:</b><span>
              The spell reaches as far as 25 feet away from you. The maximum 거리 increases by 5 feet for every two full

          <p>
            <b>Medium:</b><span> The spell reaches as far as 100 feet + 10 feet per 시전자 레벨.</span>

          <h3>주문 조준하기</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">AIMING A SPELL</div>
          <p>
            You must make some choice about whom the spell is to affect or where the effect is to originate, depending
            on the type of spell. The next entry in a spell 묘사 defines the spell의 target (or targets), its effect, or
            its 범위, as appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Target or 목표물:</b><span>
              Some spellshave a target or targets. You cast these 주문 on creatures or objects, as defined by the spell
              itself. You must be able to see or touch the target, and you must specifically choose that target. You do
              not have to select your target until you finish casting the spell.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If the target of a spell is yourself (the spell 묘사 has a line that reads Target: You), you do not receive
            a 내성 굴림, and 주문 저항 does not apply. 내성 굴림 and 주문 저항 lines are omitted from such 주문.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some 주문 restrict you to willing targets only. Declaring yourself as a willing target is something that can
            be done at any time (even if you’re flat-footed or it isn’t your turn). Unconscious creatures are
            automatically considered willing, but a character who is conscious but immobile or helpless (such as one who
            is bound, cowering, grappling, paralyzed, pinned, or stunned) is not automatically willing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some 주문 allow you to redirect the effect to new targets or 범위 after you cast the spell. Redirecting a
            spell is a 이동 action that does not provoke 기회 공격.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>효과:</b><span> Some 주문 create or summon things rather than affecting things that are already present.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            You must designate the location where these things are to appear, either by seeing it or defining it. 거리
            determines how far away an effect can appear, but if the effect is mobile it can 이동 regardless of the
            spell의 거리.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Ray: </i><span>Some effects are 광선. You aim a ray as if using a ranged weapon, though typically you make a ranged
              touch 공격 rather than a normal ranged 공격. As with a ranged weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an
              invisible creature and hope you hit something. You don’t have to see the creature you’re trying to hit, as
              you do with a targeted spell. Intervening creatures and obstacles, however, can block your line of sight
              or provide 엄폐 for the creature you’re aiming at.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If a ray spell has a 지속시간, it의 지속시간 of the effect that the ray causes, not the length of time the
            ray itself persists.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a ray spell deals 피해, you can score a critical hit just as if it were a weapon. A ray spell threatens a
            critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double 피해 on a successful critical hit.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Spread: </i><span>Some effects, notably clouds and 안개, spread out from a point of origin, which must be a grid
              intersection. The effect can extend around corners and into 범위 that you can’t see. Figure distance by
              actual distance traveled, taking into account turns the spell effect takes. When determining distance for
              spread effects, count around 벽, not through them. As with 이동, do not trace diagonals across corners.
              You must designate the point of origin for such an effect, but you need not have line of effect (see
              below) to all portions of the effect.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>범위:</b><span>
              Some 주문 affect an 범위. Sometimes a spell 묘사 specifies a specially defined 범위, but usually an 범위
              falls into one of the categories defined below.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of the shape of 범위, you select the point where the spell originates, but otherwise you don’t
            control which creatures or objects the spell affects. The point of origin of a spell is always a grid
            intersection. When determining whether a given creature is within 범위 of a spell, count out the distance
            from the point of origin in squares just as you do when moving a character or when determining the 거리 for
            a ranged 공격. The only difference is that instead of counting from the center of one square to the center
            of the next, you count from intersection to intersection.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can count diagonally across a square, but remember that every second diagonal counts as 2 squares of
            distance. If the far edge of a square is within the spell의 범위, anything within that square is within the
            spell의 범위. If the spell의 범위 only touches the near edge of a square, however, anything within that
            square is unaffected by the spell.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>폭발, Emanation, or Spread: </i><span>Most 주문 that affect an 범위 function as a 폭발, an emanation, or a spread. In each case, you select the
              spell의 point of origin and measure its effect from that point.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            A 폭발 spell affects whatever it catches in its 범위, even including creatures that you can’t see. It can’t
            affect creatures with total 엄폐 from its point of origin (in other words, its effects don’t extend around
            corners). The default shape for a 폭발 effect is a sphere, but some 폭발 주문 are specifically described as
            cone-shaped. A 폭발의 범위 defines how far from the point of origin the spell의 effect extends.
          </p>
          <p>
            An emanation spell functions like a 폭발 spell, except that the effect continues to radiate from the point
            of origin for 지속시간 of the spell. Most emanations are cones or spheres.
          </p>
          <p>
            A spread spell spreads out like a 폭발 but can turn corners. You select the point of origin, and the spell
            spreads out a given distance in all directions. Figure 범위 the spell effect fills by taking into account
            any turns the spell effect takes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Cone, Cylinder, Line, or Sphere: </i><span>Most 주문 that affect an 범위 have a particular shape, such as a cone, cylinder, line, or sphere.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            A cone-shaped spell shoots away from you in a quarter-circle in the direction you designate. It starts from
            any corner of your square and widens out as it goes. Most cones are either 폭발 or emanations (see above),
            and thus won’t go around corners.
          </p>
          <p>
            When casting a cylinder-shaped spell, you select the spell의 point of origin. This point is the center of a
            horizontal circle, and the spell shoots down from the circle, filling a cylinder. A cylinder-shaped spell
            ignores any obstructions within its 범위.
          </p>
          <p>
            A line-shaped spell shoots away from you in a line in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner
            of your square and extends to the limit of its 거리 or until it strikes a barrier that blocks line of
            effect. A line-shaped spell affects all creatures in squares that the line passes through.
          </p>
          <p>
            A sphere-shaped spell expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical 범위. Spheres may be 폭발,
            emanations, or spreads.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Creatures: </i><span>A spell with this kind of 범위 affects creatures directly (like a targeted spell), but it affects all
              creatures in an 범위 of some kind rather than individual creatures you select. 범위 might be a spherical
              폭발 , a cone-shaped 폭발, or some other shape.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Many 주문 affect “living creatures,” which means all creatures other than constructs and undead. Creatures
            in the spell의 범위 that are not of the appropriate type do not count against the creatures affected.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Objects: </i><span>A spell with this kind of 범위 affects objects within an 범위 you select (as Creatures, but affecting
              objects instead).</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Other: </i><span>A spell can have a unique 범위, as defined in its 묘사.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>(S) Shapeable: </i><span>If an 범위 or Effect entry ends with “(S),” you can shape the spell. A shaped effect or 범위 can have no
              dimension smaller than 10 feet. Many effects or 범위 are given as cubes to make it easy to model irregular
              shapes. Three-dimensional volumes are most often needed to define aerial or underwater effects and
              범위.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Line of 효과:</b><span>
              A line of effect is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what a spell can affect. A line of effect is
              canceled by a solid barrier. It의 like line of sight for ranged 무기, except that it의 not blocked by
              안개, 암흑, and other factors that limit normal sight.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            You must have a clear line of effect to any target that you 주문 시전 on or to any space in which you 소원
            to create an effect. You must have a clear line of effect to the point of origin of any spell you cast<i>.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            A 폭발, cone, cylinder, or emanation spell affects only an 범위, creatures, or objects to which it has line
            of effect from its origin (a spherical 폭발의 center point, a cone-shaped 폭발의 starting point, a
            cylinder의 circle, or an emanation의 point of origin).
          </p>
          <p>
            An otherwise solid barrier with a hole of at least 1 square foot through it does not block a spell의 line of
            effect. Such an opening means that the 5-foot length of wall containing the hole is no longer considered a
            barrier for 목적 of a spell의 line of effect.

          <p>A spell의 지속시간 entry tells you how long the magical energy of the spell lasts.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Timed 지속시간: </b><span>Many 지속시간 are measured in rounds, minutes, hours, or some other increment. When the time is up, the
              magic goes away and the spell ends. If a spell의 지속시간 is variable 지속시간 is rolled secretly (the

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Instantaneous:</b><span>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Permanent: </b><span>The energy remains as long as the effect does. This means the spell is vulnerable to

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>집중:</b><span>
              The spell lasts as long as you concentrate on it. Concentrating to maintain a spell is a standard action
              that does not provoke 기회 공격. Anything that could break your 집중 when casting a spell can also break
              your 집중 while you’re maintaining one, causing the spell to end.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can’t 주문 시전 while concentrating on another one. Sometimes a spell lasts for a short time after you
            cease concentrating.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Subjects, Effects, and 범위:</b><span>
              If the spell affects creatures directly the result travels with the subjects for the spell의 지속시간. If
              the spell creates an effect, the effect lasts for 지속시간. The effect might 이동 or remain still. Such an
              effect can be destroyed prior to when its 지속시간 ends. If the spell affects an 범위 then the spell stays
              with that 범위 for its 지속시간.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Creatures become subject to the spell when they enter 범위 and are no longer subject to it when they leave.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Touch 주문 and Holding 돌격:</b><span>
              In most cases, if you don’t discharge a touch spell on the round you cast it, you can hold 돌격 (postpone
              the discharge of the spell) indefinitely. You can make touch 공격 round after round. If you cast another
              spell, the touch spell dissipates.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Some touch spellsallow you to touch multiple targets as part of the spell. You can’t hold 돌격 of such a
            spell; you must touch all targets of the spell in the same round that you finish casting the spell.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Discharge:</b><span> Occasionally a 주문 lasts for a set 지속시간 or until triggered or discharged.</span>

          <p>
            <b>(D) Dismissible:</b><span>
              If 지속시간 line ends with “(D),” you can dismiss the spell at will. You must be within 거리 of the
              spell의 effect and must 말하기 words of 차원 강제퇴거, which are usually a modified form of the spell의
              verbal component. If the spell has no verbal component, you can dismiss the effect with a gesture.
              Dismissing a spell is a standard action that does not provoke 기회 공격.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            A spell that depends on 집중 is dismissible by its very nature, and dismissing it does not take an action,

            <b>Partial:</b><span>
              The spell causes an effect on its subject. A successful 내성 굴림 means that some 하급 effect
              occurs.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Half:</b><span> The spell deals 피해, and a successful 내성 굴림 halves 피해 taken (round down).</span>

          <p>
            <b>(object):</b><span>
              The spell can be cast on objects, which receive 내성 굴림 only if they are magical or if they are attended
              (held, worn, grasped, or the like) by a creature resisting the spell, in which case the object uses the
              creature의 내성 굴림 보너스 unless its own 보너스 is 상급. (This notation does not mean that a spell can
              be cast only on objects. Some 주문 of this sort can be cast on creatures or objects.) A magic item의 내성
              굴림 보너스 are each equal to 2 + one-half the item의 시전자 레벨.
            </span>

          <p>
            <b>(harmless):</b><span>
              The spell is usually beneficial, not harmful, but a targeted creature can attempt a 내성 굴림 if it

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>내성 굴림 난이도 등급:</b><span>
              A 내성 굴림 against your spell has a DC of 10 + 레벨 of the spell + your 보너스 for the relevant ability
              (지능 for a 마법사, 매력 for a 소서러 or 음유시인, or 지혜 for a 사제, 드루이드, 성기사, or 레인저). A

          <p>
            <b>Succeeding on a 내성 굴림: </b><span>A creature that successfully 내성 굴림 against a spell that has no obvious physical effects feels a

              succeeds against a targeted spell you sense that the spell has failed. You do not sense when creatures
              succeed on 내성 굴림 against effect and 범위 주문.</span>

          <p>
            <b>Automatic Failures and Successes:</b><span>
              A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a 내성 굴림 is always a failure, and the spell may cause 피해 to
              exposed items (see Items Surviving after a 내성 굴림, below). A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always
              a success.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Voluntarily Giving up a 내성 굴림:</b><span>
              A creature can voluntarily forego a 내성 굴림 and willingly accept a spell의 result. Even a character with
              a special 저항 to magic can suppress this quality.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Items Surviving after a 내성 굴림:</b><span>
              Unless 설명 문구 for the spell specifies otherwise, all items carried or worn by a creature are assumed to
              survive a magical 공격. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its 내성 굴림 against the effect, however, an
              exposed item is harmed (if 공격 can 해악 objects). Refer to 표: Items Affected by Magical 공격. Determine
              which four objects carried or worn by the creature are most likely to be affected and roll randomly among
              them. The randomly determined item must make a 내성 굴림 against 공격 form and take whatever 피해 공격
              deal.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If an item is not carried or worn and is not magical, it does not get a 내성 굴림. It simply is dealt the
            appropriate 피해.

          <div class="original-headline">SPELL RESISTANCE</div>
          <p>
            주문 저항 is a special defensive ability. If your spell is being resisted by a creature with 주문 저항, you
            must make a 시전자 레벨 check (1d20 + 시전자 레벨) at least equal to the creature의 주문 저항 for the spell
            to affect that creature. The defender의 주문 저항 is like an 방어도 against magical 공격. Include any
            adjustments to your 시전자 레벨 to this 시전자 레벨 check.
          </p>
          <p>
            주문 저항 entry and 설명 문구 of a spell 묘사 tell you whether 주문 저항 protects creatures from the spell.
            In many cases, 주문 저항 applies only when a resistant creature is targeted by the spell, not when a
            resistant creature encounters a spell that is already in place.
          </p>
          <p>
            The terms “object” and “harmless” mean the same thing for 주문 저항 as they do for 내성 굴림. A creature
            with 주문 저항 must voluntarily lower 저항(a standard action) in order to be affected by a spell noted as
            harmless. In such a case, you do not need to make 시전자 레벨 check described above.

          <p>
            A 마법사의 레벨 limits the number of 주문 she can prepare and cast. Her high 지능 score might allow her to
            prepare a few extra 주문. She can prepare the same spell more than once, but each preparation counts as one
            spell toward her daily limit. To prepare a spell 마법사 must have an 지능 score of at least 10 + the spell의
            레벨.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Rest: </b><span>To prepare her daily 주문, a 마법사 must first 수면 for 8 hours. 마법사 does not have to slumber for
              every minute of the time, but she must refrain from 이동, 전투, spellcasting, skill use, conversation, or
              any other fairly demanding physical or mental task during the rest period. If her rest is interrupted,
              each interruption adds 1 hour to the total amount of time she has to rest in order to clear her mind, and
              she must have at least 1 hour of uninterrupted rest immediately prior to preparing her 주문. If the
              character does not need to 수면 for some reason, she still must have 8 hours of restful calm before
              preparing any 주문.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Recent Casting Limit/Rest Interruptions:</b><span>
              If a 마법사 has cast 주문 recently, the drain on her resources reduces her capacity to prepare 새로운
              주문. When she prepares 주문 for the coming day, all 주문 she has cast within the last 8 hours count
              against her daily limit.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Preparation 환경:</b><span>
              To prepare any spell, a 마법사 must have enough peace, quiet, and comfort to allow for proper 집중. The
              마법사의 surroundings need not be luxurious, but they must be free from overt distractions. Exposure to
              inclement 날씨 prevents the necessary 집중, as does any injury or failed 내성 굴림 the character might
              experience while studying. 마법사 also must have access to their spellbooks to study from and sufficient
              빛 to read them by. There is one major exception: A 마법사 can prepare a
              <i>마법 읽기 </i>spell even without a spellbook.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Spell Preparation Time:</b><span>
              After resting, a 마법사 must study her spellbook to prepare any 주문 that day. If she wants to prepare all
              her 주문, the process takes 1 hour. Preparing some smaller portion of her daily capacity takes a
              proportionally smaller amount of time, but always at least 15 minutes, the minimum time required to
              achieve the proper mental state.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Spell Selection and Preparation:</b><span>
              Until she prepares 주문 from her spellbook, the only 주문 a 마법사 has available to cast are the ones that
              she already had prepared from the previous day and has not yet used. During the study period, she chooses
              which 주문 to prepare. If a 마법사 already has 주문 prepared (from the previous day) that she has not
              cast, she can abandon some or all of them to make room for 새로운 주문.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            When preparing 주문 for the day, a 마법사 can leave some of these spell slots open. Later during that day,
            she can repeat the preparation process as often as she likes, time and circumstances permitting. During
            these extra sessions of preparation, 마법사 can fill these unused spell slots. She cannot, however, abandon
            a previously prepared spell to replace it with another one or fill a slot that is empty because she has 주문
            시전 in the meantime. That sort of preparation requires a mind fresh from rest. Like the first session of
            the day, this preparation takes at least 15 minutes, and it takes longer if 마법사 prepares more than
            one-quarter of her 주문.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Spell Slots:</b><span>
              The various character class tables show how many 주문 of each 레벨 a character can cast per day. These
              openings for daily 주문 are called spell slots. A spellcaster always has the option to fill a higher-레벨
              spell slot with a lower-레벨 spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high enough ability score to cast 주문 that
              would otherwise be his or her due still gets the slots but must fill them with 주문 of lower 레벨.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Prepared Spell Retention:</b><span>
              Once a 마법사 prepares a spell, it remains in her mind as a nearly cast spell until she uses the
              prescribed 구성요소 to complete and 트리거 it or until she abandons it. Certain other events, such as the
              effects of 마법 아이템 or 특수 공격 from 몬스터, can wipe a prepared spell from a character의 mind.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Death and Prepared Spell Retention:</b><span>
              If a spellcaster dies, all prepared 주문 stored in his or her mind are wiped away. Potent magic (such as
              <i>시체 되살리기, 부활, </i>or
              <i>진정한 부활</i>) can recover the lost energy when it recovers the
              character.</span>

          <h3>비전 마법 작성</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">ARCANE MAGICAL WRITINGS</div>
          <p>
            To record an arcane spell in written form, a character uses complex notation that describes the magical
            forces involved in the spell. The writer uses the same system no matter what her native language or culture.
            However, each character uses the system in her own way. Another person의 magical writing remains
            incomprehensible to even the most powerful 마법사 until she takes time to study and decipher it.
          </p>
          <p>
            To decipher an arcane magical writing (such as a single spell in written form in another의 spellbook or on a
            scroll), a character must make a 주문학 check (DC 20 + the spell의 레벨). If the skill check fails, the
            character cannot attempt to read that particular spell again until the next day. A
            <i>마법 읽기 </i>spell automatically deciphers a magical writing without a
            skill check. If the person who created the magical writing is on hand to help the reader, success is also
            automatic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a character deciphers a particular magical writing, she does not need to decipher it again. Deciphering
            a magical writing allows the reader to 식별 the spell and gives some idea of its effects (as explained in
            the spell 묘사). If the magical writing was a scroll and the reader can cast 비전 주문, she can attempt to
            use the scroll.
          </p>
          <p>마법사 주문 and Borrowed Spellbooks</p>
          <p>
            A 마법사 can use a borrowed spellbook to prepare a spell she already knows and has recorded in her own
            spellbook, but preparation success is not assured. First, 마법사 must decipher the writing in the book (see
            비전 마법 작성, above). Once a spell from another spellcaster의 book is deciphered, the reader must make a
            주문학 check (DC 15 + spell의 레벨) to prepare the spell. If the check succeeds, 마법사 can prepare the
            spell. She must repeat the check to prepare the spell again, no matter how many times she has prepared it
            before. If the check fails, she cannot try to prepare the spell from the same source again until the next
            day. (However, as explained above, she does not need to repeat a check to decipher the writing.)
          </p>
          <p>Adding 주문 to a 마법사의 Spellbook</p>
          <p>
            마법사 can add 새로운 주문 to their spellbooks through several methods. If a 마법사 has chosen to specialize
            in a 학파 of magic, she can learn 주문 only from 학파 whose 주문 she can cast.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>주문 Gained at a New 레벨: </b><span>마법사 공연 a certain amount of spell research between adventures. Each time a character attains a new
              마법사 레벨, she gains two 주문 of her choice to add to her spellbook. The two free 주문 must be of spell
              레벨 she can cast. If she has chosen to specialize in a 학파 of magic, one of the two free 주문 must be
              from her specialty 학파.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>주문 Copied from Another의 Spellbook or a Scroll:</b><span>
              A 마법사 can also add a spell to her book whenever she encounters one on a magic scroll or in another
              마법사의 spellbook. No matter what the spell의 source, 마법사 must first decipher the magical writing (see
              비전 마법 작성, above). Next, she must spend a day studying the spell. At the end of the day, she must
              make a 주문학 check (DC 15 + spell의 레벨). A 마법사 who has specialized in a 학파 of 주문 gains a +2
              보너스 on 주문학 check if the new spell is from her specialty 학파. She cannot, however, learn any 주문
              from her prohibited 학파. If the check succeeds, 마법사 understands the spell and can copy it into her
              spellbook (see Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook, below). The process leaves a spellbook that was
              copied from unharmed, but a spell successfully copied from a magic scroll disappears from the
              parchment.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If the check fails, 마법사 cannot understand or copy the spell. She cannot attempt to learn or copy that
            spell again until she gains another rank in 주문학. A spell that was being copied from a scroll does not
            vanish from the scroll.
          </p>
          <p>
            In most cases, 마법사 돌격 a fee for the privilege of copying 주문 from their spellbooks. This fee is
            usually equal to the spell의 레벨 × 50 gp.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Independent Research:</b><span>
              A 마법사 also can research a spell independently, duplicating an existing spell or creating an entirely
              new one.</span>

            <b>Space in the Spellbook:</b><span>
              A spell takes up one page of the spellbook per spell 레벨. Even a 0-레벨 spell (cantrip) takes one page. A
              spellbook has one hundred pages.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Materials and Costs:</b><span> Materials for writing the spell cost 100 gp per page.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that a 마법사 does not have to pay these costs in time or gold for 주문 she gains for free at each new
            레벨.
          </p>
          <p>Replacing and Copying Spellbooks</p>
          <p>
            A 마법사 can use the procedure for learning a spell to reconstruct a lost spellbook. If she already has a
            particular spell prepared, she can write it directly into a new book at a cost of 100 gp per page (as noted
            in Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook, above). The process wipes the prepared spell from her mind, just as
            casting it would. If she does not have the spell prepared, she can prepare it from a borrowed spellbook and
            then write it into a new book.
          </p>
          <p>
            Duplicating an existing spellbook uses the same procedure as replacing it, but the task is much easier. The
            time requirement and cost per page are halved.
          </p>
          <p>Selling a Spellbook</p>
          <p>
            Captured spellbooks can be sold for a gp amount equal to one-half the cost of purchasing and inscribing the
            주문 within (that is, one-half of 100 gp per page of 주문). A spellbook entirely filled with 주문(that is,
            with one hundred pages of 주문 inscribed in it) is worth 5,000 gp.

          <p>
            소서러와 음유시인 cast 비전 주문, but they do not have spellbooks and do not prepare their 주문. A 소서러의
            or 음유시인의 직업 레벨 limits the number of 주문 he can cast (see these class 묘사). His high 매력 score
            might allow him to cast a few extra 주문. A member of either class must have a 매력 score of at least 10 + a
            spell의 레벨 to cast the spell.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Daily Readying of 주문:</b><span>
              Each day, 소서러와 음유시인 must focus their minds on the task of casting their 주문. A 소서러 or 음유시인
              needs 8 hours of rest (just like a 마법사), after which he spends 15 minutes concentrating. (A 음유시인
              must sing, recite, or play an instrument of some kind while concentrating.) During this period, 소서러 or
              음유시인 readies his mind to cast his daily allotment of 주문. Without such a period to refresh himself,
              the character does not regain the spell slots he used up the day before.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Recent Casting Limit: </b><span>As with 마법사, any 주문 cast within the last 8 hours count against 소서러의 or 음유시인의 daily

            <b>Adding 주문 to a 소서러의 or 음유시인의 Repertoire:</b><span>
              A 소서러 or 음유시인 gains 주문 each time he attains a new 레벨 in his class and never gains 주문 any
              other way. When your 소서러 or 음유시인 gains a new 레벨, consult 표: 음유시인 주문 Known or 표: 소서러
              주문 Known to learn how many 주문 from the appropriate spell list he now knows. With permission, 소서러와
              음유시인 can also select 주문 they gain from new and unusual 주문 that they have gained some understanding
              of.</span>

        <p>
          사제, 드루이드, experienced 성기사, and experienced 레인저 can cast 신성 주문. Unlike 비전 주문, 신성 주문
          draw power from a 신성 source. 사제 gain spell power from deities or from 신성 forces. 신성 force of nature
          powers 드루이드 and 레인저 주문. 신성 forces of law and good power 성기사 주문. 신성 주문 tend to focus on
          치료 and protection and are less flashy, destructive, and disruptive than 비전 주문.

          <h3>신성 주문 준비</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">PREPARING DIVINE SPELLS</div>
          <p>
            신성 spellcasters prepare their 주문 in largely the same manner as 마법사 do, but with a few differences.
            The relevant ability for 신성 주문 is 지혜. To prepare a 신성 spell, a character must have a 지혜 score of
            10 + the spell의 레벨. Likewise, 보너스 주문 are based on 지혜.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Time of Day:</b><span>
              A 신성 spellcaster chooses and prepares 주문 ahead of time, just as a 마법사 does. However, a 신성
              spellcaster does not require a period of rest to prepare 주문. Instead, the character chooses a particular
              part of the day to pray and receive 주문. The time is usually associated with some daily event. If some
              event prevents a character from praying at the proper time, he must do so as soon as possible. If the
              character does not stop to pray for 주문 at the first opportunity, he must wait until the next day to
              prepare 주문.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Spell Selection and Preparation:</b><span>
              A 신성 spellcaster selects and prepares 주문 ahead of time through 기도 and meditation at a particular
              time of day. The time required to prepare 주문 is the same as it is for a 마법사(1 hour), as is the
              requirement for a relatively peaceful 환경. A 신성 spellcaster does not have to prepare all his 주문 at
              once. However, the character의 mind is considered fresh only during his or her first daily spell
              preparation, so a 신성 spellcaster cannot fill a slot that is empty because he or she has 주문 시전 or
              abandoned a previously prepared spell.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            신성 spellcasters do not require spellbooks. However, such a character의 spell selection is limited to the
            주문 on the list for his or her class. 사제, 드루이드, 성기사, and 레인저 have separate spell lists. A 사제
            also has access to two domains determined during his character creation. Each domain gives him access to a
            domain spell at each spell 레벨 from 1st to 9th, as well as a special granted power. With access to two
            domain 주문 at each spell 레벨—one from each of his two domains—a 사제 must prepare, as an 추가 계열 spell,
            one or the other each day for each 레벨 of spell he can cast. If a domain spell is not on 사제 spell list,
            it can be prepared only in a domain spell slot.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Spell Slots:</b><span> The character class tables show how many 주문 of each 레벨 a character can cast per day.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            These openings for daily 주문 are called spell slots. A spellcaster always has the option to fill a
            higher-레벨 spell slot with a lower 레벨 spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high enough ability score to cast
            주문 that would otherwise be his or her due still gets the slots but must fill them with 주문 of lower 레벨.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Recent Casting Limit:</b><span>
              As with 비전 주문, at the time of preparation any 주문 cast within the previous 8 hours count against the

            <b>주문 Gained at a New 레벨: </b><span>Characters who can cast 신성 주문 undertake a certain amount of study between adventures. Each time such

          <p>
            <b>Independent Research:</b><span>
              A 신성 spellcaster also can research a spell independently, much as an arcane spellcaster can. Only the
              creator of such a spell can prepare and cast it, unless he decides to share it with others.</span>

          <b>유사주문 능력:</b><span>
            Usually, a 유사주문 ability works just like the spell of that 이름. A few 유사주문 능력 are unique;
            these are explained in the text where they are described.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          A 유사주문 ability has no verbal, somatic, or material component, nor does it require a focus or have an XP
          cost. The user activates it mentally. 갑옷 never affects a 유사주문 ability의 use, even if the ability
          resembles an arcane spell with a somatic component.
        </p>
        <p>
          A 유사주문 ability has a 시전 시간 of 1 standard action unless noted otherwise in the ability or spell 묘사.
          In all other ways, a 유사주문 ability functions just like a spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          유사주문 능력 are subject to 주문 저항 and to being dispelled by
          <i>마법 무효화</i>. They do not function in 범위 where magic is suppressed or
          negated. 유사주문 능력 cannot be used to counterspell, nor can they be counterspelled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some creatures are actually 소서러 of a sort. They cast 비전 주문 as 소서러 do, using 구성요소 when required.
          In fact, an individual creature could have some 유사주문 능력 and also cast other 주문 as a 소서러.

            범위 that negate or disrupt magic have no effect on extraordinary 능력. They are not subject to dispelling,
            and they function normally in an <i>대마법 보호장. </i>Indeed,
