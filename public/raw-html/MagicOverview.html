      <div class="original-headline">MAGIC OVERVIEW</div>
      <p>
        A spell is a one-time magical effect. 주문 come in two types: arcane (cast by 음유시인, 소서러, and 마법사) and
        신성(cast by 사제, 드루이드, and experienced 성기사 and 레인저). Some spellcasters select their 주문 from a
        limited list of 주문 known, while others have access to a wide variety of options.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most spellcasters prepare their 주문 in advance—whether from a spellbook or through devout 기도 and meditation—
        while some cast 주문 spontaneously without preparation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite these different ways that characters use to learn or prepare their 주문, when it comes to casting them,
        주문 are very much alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cutting across the categories of arcane and 신성 주문 are the eight 학파 of magic. These 학파 represent the
        different ways that 주문 take effect.
      </p>

        <h2>주문 시전하기</h2>
        <div class="original-headline">CASTING SPELLS</div>
        <p>
          Whether a spell is arcane or 신성, and whether a character prepares 주문 in advance or chooses them on the
          감지, casting a spell works the same way.
        </p>
        <section id="h3-2-choosing-a-spell">
          <h3>주문 선택하기</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">CHOOSING A SPELL</div>
          <p>
            First you must choose which spell to cast. If you’re a 사제, 드루이드, experienced 성기사, experienced
            레인저, or 마법사, you select from among 주문 prepared earlier in the day and not yet cast (see 마법사 주문
            준비 and 신성 주문 준비).
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re a 음유시인 or 소서러, you can select any spell you know, provided you are capable of 주문 시전하기
            of that 레벨 or higher.
          </p>
          <p>
            To 주문 시전, you must be able to 말하기(if the spell has a verbal component), gesture (if it has a somatic
            component), and manipulate the material 구성요소 or focus (if any). Additionally, you must concentrate to
            주문 시전.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a spell has multiple versions, you choose which version to use when you cast it. You don’t have to
            prepare (or learn, in the case of a 음유시인 or 소서러) a specific version of the spell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you’ve cast a prepared spell, you can’t cast it again until you prepare it again. (If you’ve prepared
            multiple copies of a single spell, you can cast each copy once.) If you’re a 음유시인 or 소서러, casting a
            spell counts against your daily limit for 주문 of that spell 레벨, but you can cast the same spell again if
            you haven’t reached your limit.
          </p>

        <section id="h3-3-concentration">
          <h3>집중</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">CONCENTRATION</div>
          <p>
            To 주문 시전, you must concentrate. If something interrupts your 집중 while you’re casting, you must make a
            집중 check or lose the spell. The more distracting the interruption and the higher 레벨 of the spell you
            are trying to cast, the higher the DC is. If you fail the check, you lose the spell just as if you had cast
            it to no effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700">Injury:</span
            ><span>
              If while trying to 주문 시전 you take 피해, you must make a 집중 check (DC 10 + points of 피해 taken + the
              레벨 of the spell you’re casting). If you fail the check, you lose the spell without effect. The
              interrupting event strikes during spellcasting if it comes between when you start and when you complete a
              spell (for a spell with a 시전 시간 of 1 full round or more) or if it comes in response to your casting
              the spell (such as an 공격 of opportunity provoked by the spell or a contingent 공격, such as a readied
              action).</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are taking continuous 피해 half 피해 is considered to take place while you are casting a spell.
            You must make a 집중 check (DC 10 + 1/2 피해 that the continuous source last dealt + 레벨 of the
            spell you’re casting). If the last 피해 dealt was the last 피해 that the effect could deal then 피해 is
            over, and it does not 주의산만 you.
          </p>
          <p>Repeated 피해 does not count as continuous 피해.</p>

            If the spell interferes with you or 주의산만 you in some other way, the DC is the spell’s 내성 굴림 DC + the
            레벨 of the spell you’re casting. For a spell with no 내성 굴림, it’s the DC that the spell’s 내성 굴림
            would have if a save were allowed.

          <h3>주문 무효화</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">COUNTERSPELLS</div>
          <p>
            It is possible to cast any spell as a counterspell. By doing so, you are using the spell’s energy to disrupt
            the casting of the same spell by another character. Counterspelling works even if one spell is 신성 and the
            other arcane.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700">How 주문 무효화 Work: </span
            ><span
              >To use a counterspell, you must select an opponent as the target of the counterspell. You do this by
              choosing 준비 action. In doing so, you elect to wait to complete your action until your opponent tries
              to 주문 시전. (You may still 이동 your 속도, since 준비 is a standard action.)</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            If the target of your counterspell tries to 주문 시전, make a 주문학 check (DC 15 + the spell’s 레벨). This
            check is a free action. If the check succeeds, you correctly 식별 the opponent’s spell and can attempt to
            counter it. If the check fails, you can’t do either of these things.
          </p>
          <p>
            To complete the action, you must then cast the correct spell. As a general rule, a spell can only counter
            itself. If you are able to cast the same spell and you have it prepared (if you prepare 주문), you cast it,
            altering it slightly to create a counterspell effect. If the target is within 거리, both 주문 automatically
            negate each other with no other results.

          <div class="original-headline">CASTER LEVEL</div>
          <p>
            A spell’s power often depends on its 시전자 레벨, which for most spellcasting characters is equal to your
            class 레벨 in the class you’re using to cast the spell.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can 주문 시전 at a lower 시전자 레벨 than normal, but 시전자 레벨 you choose must be high enough for
            you to cast the spell in question, and all 레벨-dependent features must be based on the same 시전자 레벨.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event that a class feature, domain granted power, or other special ability provides an adjustment to
            your 시전자 레벨, that adjustment applies not only to effects based on 시전자 레벨(such as 거리, 지속시간,
            and 피해 dealt) but also to your 시전자 레벨 check to overcome your target’s 주문 저항 and to 시전자
            레벨 used in dispel checks (both the dispel check and the DC of the check).

              circumstance 보너스, and racial 보너스, only the better 보너스 works (see 주문 효과 조합하기, below). The

              회피술 are protective 주문. They create physical or magical barriers, negate magical or physical 능력,
              해악 trespassers, or even banish the subject of the spell to another plane of existence.
            </p>
            <p>
              If one 회피술 spell is active within 10 feet of another for 24 hours or more, the magical fields interfere
              with each other and create barely visible energy fluctuations. The DC to find such 주문 with 탐색
              skill drops by 4.
            </p>
            <p>
              If an 회피술 creates a barrier that keeps certain types of creatures at bay, that barrier cannot be used
              to push away those creatures. If you force the barrier against such a creature, you feel a discernible
              pressure against the barrier. If you continue to apply pressure, you end the spell.

              always, obey your 명령.
            </p>
            <p>
              A creature or object brought into being or transported to your location by a 소환술 spell cannot appear
              inside another creature or object, nor can it appear floating in an empty space. It must arrive in an open
              location on a surface capable of supporting it.

                circumstances under which this is possible. Creatures who are called actually die when they are killed;
                they do not disappear and reform, as do those brought by a summoning spell (see below). 지속시간 of
                a calling spell is instantaneous, which means that the called creature can’t be dispelled.</span

                A summoning spell instantly brings a creature or object to a place you designate. When the spell ends or
                is dispelled, a summoned creature is instantly sent back to where it came from, but a summoned object is
                not sent back unless the spell 묘사 specifically indicates this. A summoned creature also goes away if
                it is killed or if its 히트 포인트 drop to 0 or lower. It is not really 죽음. It takes 24 hours for the

              A summoned creature cannot use any innate summoning 능력 it may have, and it refuses to cast any 주문 that
              would cost it XP, or to use any spell-like 능력 that would cost XP if they were 주문.

                A 염탐 spell creates an invisible magical sensor that sends you information. Unless noted otherwise, the

                effects that target you, but not 주문 or effects that emanate from you. However, the sensor is treated
                as a separate, independent sensory organ of yours, and thus it functions normally even if you have been
                blinded, deafened, or otherwise suffered sensory impairment.</span

                Figments cannot make something seem to be something else. A figment that includes audible effects cannot
                duplicate intelligible speech unless the spell 묘사 specifically says it can. If intelligible speech is
                possible, it must be in a language you can 말하기. If you try to duplicate a language you cannot 말하기,

          <p>
            Most of these descriptors have no game effect by themselves, but they govern how the spell interacts with

            A language-dependent spell uses intelligible language as a medium for communication. If the target cannot
            understand or cannot hear what the caster of a language-dependant spell says the spell fails.

            The next line of a spell 묘사 gives the spell’s 레벨, a number between 0 and 9 that defines the spell’s
            relative power. This number is preceded by an abbreviation for the class whose members can cast the spell.
            레벨 entry also indicates whether a spell is a domain spell and, if so, what its domain and its 레벨 as
            a domain spell are. A spell’s 레벨 affects the DC for any save allowed against the effect.

          <p>
            A spell’s 구성요소 are what you must do or possess to cast it. 구성요소 entry in a spell 묘사 includes
            abbreviations that tell you what type of 구성요소 it has. Specifics for material, focus, and XP 구성요소 are
            given at the end of 설명 문구. Usually you don’t worry about 구성요소, but when you can’t use a
            component for some reason or when a material or focus component is expensive, then 구성요소 are
            important.

              strong voice. A <span style="font-style: italic">침묵 </span>spell or a gag spoils the incantation (and
              thus the spell). A spellcaster who has been deafened has a 20% chance to spoil any spell with a verbal
              component that he or she tries to cast.</span

              cannot spend so much XP that you lose a 레벨, so you cannot cast the spell unless you have enough XP to
              spare. However, you may, on gaining enough XP to attain a new 레벨, use those XP for casting a spell
              rather than keeping them and advancing a 레벨. The XP are treated just like a material component—expended

          <div class="original-headline">CASTING TIME</div>
          <p>
            Most 주문 have a 시전 시간 of 1 standard action. Others take 1 round or more, while a few require only a
            free action.
          </p>
          <p>
            A spell that takes 1 round to cast is a full-round action. It comes into effect just before the beginning of
            your turn in the round after you began casting the spell. You then act normally after the spell is
            completed.
          </p>
          <p>
            A spell that takes 1 minute to cast comes into effect just before your turn 1 minute later (and for each of
            those 10 rounds, you are casting a spell as a full-round action, just as noted above for 1- round 시전
            시간). These actions must be consecutive and uninterrupted, or the spell automatically fails.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you begin a spell that takes 1 round or longer to cast, you must continue 집중 from the current
            round to just before your turn in the next round (at least). If you lose 집중 before the casting is
            complete, you lose the spell.
          </p>
          <p>
            A spell with a 시전 시간 of 1 free action doesn’t count against your normal limit of one spell per round.
            However, you may cast such a spell only once per round. Casting a spell with a 시전 시간 of 1 free action
            doesn’t provoke 기회 공격.
          </p>
          <p>
            You make all pertinent decisions about a spell (거리, target, 범위, effect, version, and so forth) when the

          <div class="original-headline">RANGE</div>
          <p>
            A spell’s 거리 indicates how far from you it can reach, as defined in 거리 entry of the spell 묘사. A
            spell’s 거리 is the maximum distance from you that the spell’s effect can occur, as well as the maximum
            distance at which you can designate the spell’s point of origin. If any portion of the spell’s 범위 would
            extend beyond this 거리, that 범위 is wasted. Standard 거리 include the following.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 700">Personal:</span><span> The spell affects only you.</span></p>

            ><span>
              You must touch a creature or object to affect it. A touch spell that deals 피해 can score a critical hit
              just as a weapon can. A touch spell threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double 피해
              on a successful critical hit. Some touch 주문 allow you to touch multiple targets. You can touch as many
              willing targets as you can reach as part of the casting, but all targets of the spell must be touched in
              the same round that you finish casting the spell.</span

          <h3>주문 조준하기</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">AIMING A SPELL</div>
          <p>
            You must make some choice about whom the spell is to affect or where the effect is to originate, depending
            on the type of spell. The next entry in a spell 묘사 defines the spell’s target (or targets), its effect, or
            its 범위, as appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700">Target or 목표물:</span
            ><span>
              Some spellshave a target or targets. You cast these 주문 on creatures or objects, as defined by the spell
              itself. You must be able to see or touch the target, and you must specifically choose that target. You do
              not have to select your target until you finish casting the spell.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            If the target of a spell is yourself (the spell 묘사 has a line that reads Target: You), you do not receive
            a 내성 굴림, and 주문 저항 does not apply. 내성 굴림 and 주문 저항 lines are omitted from such 주문.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some 주문 restrict you to willing targets only. Declaring yourself as a willing target is something that can
            be done at any time (even if you’re flat-footed or it isn’t your turn). Unconscious creatures are
            automatically considered willing, but a character who is conscious but immobile or helpless (such as one who
            is bound, cowering, grappling, paralyzed, pinned, or stunned) is not automatically willing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some 주문 allow you to redirect the effect to new targets or 범위 after you cast the spell. Redirecting a
            spell is a 이동 action that does not provoke 기회 공격.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700">효과:</span
            ><span> Some 주문 create or summon things rather than affecting things that are already present.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            You must designate the location where these things are to appear, either by seeing it or defining it. 거리
            determines how far away an effect can appear, but if the effect is mobile it can 이동 regardless of the
            spell’s 거리.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-style: italic">Ray: </span
            ><span
              >Some effects are 광선. You aim a ray as if using a ranged weapon, though typically you make a ranged
              touch 공격 rather than a normal ranged 공격. As with a ranged weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an
              invisible creature and hope you hit something. You don’t have to see the creature you’re trying to hit, as
              you do with a targeted spell. Intervening creatures and obstacles, however, can block your line of sight
              or provide 엄폐 for the creature you’re aiming at.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            If a ray spell has a 지속시간, it’s 지속시간 of the effect that the ray causes, not the length of time
            the ray itself persists.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a ray spell deals 피해, you can score a critical hit just as if it were a weapon. A ray spell threatens a
            critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double 피해 on a successful critical hit.
          </p>

            <span style="font-style: italic">Spread: </span
            ><span
              >Some effects, notably clouds and 안개, spread out from a point of origin, which must be a grid
              intersection. The effect can extend around corners and into 범위 that you can’t see. Figure distance by
              actual distance traveled, taking into account turns the spell effect takes. When determining distance for
              spread effects, count around 벽, not through them. As with 이동, do not trace diagonals across corners.
              You must designate the point of origin for such an effect, but you need not have line of effect (see
              below) to all portions of the effect.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700">범위:</span
            ><span>
              Some 주문 affect an 범위. Sometimes a spell 묘사 specifies a specially defined 범위, but usually an 범위
              falls into one of the categories defined below.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of the shape of 범위, you select the point where the spell originates, but otherwise you
            don’t control which creatures or objects the spell affects. The point of origin of a spell is always a grid
            intersection. When determining whether a given creature is within 범위 of a spell, count out the
            distance from the point of origin in squares just as you do when moving a character or when determining the
            거리 for a ranged 공격. The only difference is that instead of counting from the center of one square to the
            center of the next, you count from intersection to intersection.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can count diagonally across a square, but remember that every second diagonal counts as 2 squares of
            distance. If the far edge of a square is within the spell’s 범위, anything within that square is within the
            spell’s 범위. If the spell’s 범위 only touches the near edge of a square, however, anything within that
            square is unaffected by the spell.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-style: italic">폭발, Emanation, or Spread: </span
            ><span
              >Most 주문 that affect an 범위 function as a 폭발, an emanation, or a spread. In each case, you select the
              spell’s point of origin and measure its effect from that point.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            A 폭발 spell affects whatever it catches in its 범위, even including creatures that you can’t see. It can’t
            affect creatures with total 엄폐 from its point of origin (in other words, its effects don’t extend around
            corners). The default shape for a 폭발 effect is a sphere, but some 폭발 주문 are specifically described as
            cone-shaped. A 폭발’s 범위 defines how far from the point of origin the spell’s effect extends.
          </p>
          <p>
            An emanation spell functions like a 폭발 spell, except that the effect continues to radiate from the point
            of origin for 지속시간 of the spell. Most emanations are cones or spheres.
          </p>
          <p>
            A spread spell spreads out like a 폭발 but can turn corners. You select the point of origin, and the spell
            spreads out a given distance in all directions. Figure 범위 the spell effect fills by taking into
            account any turns the spell effect takes.

          </p>
          <p>
            A cone-shaped spell shoots away from you in a quarter-circle in the direction you designate. It starts from
            any corner of your square and widens out as it goes. Most cones are either 폭발 or emanations (see above),
            and thus won’t go around corners.
          </p>
          <p>
            When casting a cylinder-shaped spell, you select the spell’s point of origin. This point is the center of a
            horizontal circle, and the spell shoots down from the circle, filling a cylinder. A cylinder-shaped spell
            ignores any obstructions within its 범위.
          </p>
          <p>
            A line-shaped spell shoots away from you in a line in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner
            of your square and extends to the limit of its 거리 or until it strikes a barrier that blocks line of
            effect. A line-shaped spell affects all creatures in squares that the line passes through.
          </p>
          <p>
            A sphere-shaped spell expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical 범위. Spheres may be 폭발,
            emanations, or spreads.

              cast only on objects. Some 주문 of this sort can be cast on creatures or objects.) A magic item’s 내성

              however, an exposed item is harmed (if 공격 can 해악 objects). Refer to 표: Items Affected by
              Magical 공격. Determine which four objects carried or worn by the creature are most likely to be affected
              and roll randomly among them. The randomly determined item must make a 내성 굴림 against 공격 form and

          <p>
            주문 저항 is a special defensive ability. If your spell is being resisted by a creature with 주문 저항, you
            must make a 시전자 레벨 check (1d20 + 시전자 레벨) at least equal to the creature’s 주문 저항 for the spell
            to affect that creature. The defender’s 주문 저항 is like an 방어도 against magical 공격. Include any
            adjustments to your 시전자 레벨 to this 시전자 레벨 check.
          </p>
          <p>
            주문 저항 entry and 설명 문구 of a spell 묘사 tell you whether 주문 저항 protects creatures from the
            spell. In many cases, 주문 저항 applies only when a resistant creature is targeted by the spell, not when a
            resistant creature encounters a spell that is already in place.
          </p>
          <p>
            The terms “object” and “harmless” mean the same thing for 주문 저항 as they do for 내성 굴림. A creature
            with 주문 저항 must voluntarily lower 저항(a standard action) in order to be affected by a spell noted
            as harmless. In such a case, you do not need to make 시전자 레벨 check described above.

            A 마법사’s 레벨 limits the number of 주문 she can prepare and cast. Her high 지능 score might allow her to
            prepare a few extra 주문. She can prepare the same spell more than once, but each preparation counts as one
            spell toward her daily limit. To prepare a spell 마법사 must have an 지능 score of at least 10 + the
            spell’s 레벨.

              any other fairly demanding physical or mental task during the rest period. If her rest is interrupted,
              each interruption adds 1 hour to the total amount of time she has to rest in order to clear her mind, and
              she must have at least 1 hour of uninterrupted rest immediately prior to preparing her 주문. If the
              character does not need to 수면 for some reason, she still must have 8 hours of restful calm before
              preparing any 주문.

            ><span>
              To prepare any spell, a 마법사 must have enough peace, quiet, and comfort to allow for proper 집중. The
              마법사’s surroundings need not be luxurious, but they must be free from overt distractions. Exposure to
              inclement 날씨 prevents the necessary 집중, as does any injury or failed 내성 굴림 the character might
              experience while studying. 마법사 also must have access to their spellbooks to study from and sufficient
              빛 to read them by. There is one major exception: A 마법사 can prepare a
              <span style="font-style: italic">마법 읽기 </span>spell even without a spellbook.
            </span>

            <span style="font-weight: 700">Spell Preparation Time:</span
            ><span>
              After resting, a 마법사 must study her spellbook to prepare any 주문 that day. If she wants to prepare all
              her 주문, the process takes 1 hour. Preparing some smaller portion of her daily capacity takes a
              proportionally smaller amount of time, but always at least 15 minutes, the minimum time required to
              achieve the proper mental state.</span

            <span style="font-weight: 700">Spell Selection and Preparation:</span
            ><span>
              Until she prepares 주문 from her spellbook, the only 주문 a 마법사 has available to cast are the ones that
              she already had prepared from the previous day and has not yet used. During the study period, she chooses
              which 주문 to prepare. If a 마법사 already has 주문 prepared (from the previous day) that she has not
              cast, she can abandon some or all of them to make room for 새로운 주문.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            When preparing 주문 for the day, a 마법사 can leave some of these spell slots open. Later during that day,
            she can repeat the preparation process as often as she likes, time and circumstances permitting. During
            these extra sessions of preparation, 마법사 can fill these unused spell slots. She cannot, however,
            abandon a previously prepared spell to replace it with another one or fill a slot that is empty because she
            has 주문 시전 in the meantime. That sort of preparation requires a mind fresh from rest. Like the first
            session of the day, this preparation takes at least 15 minutes, and it takes longer if 마법사 prepares
            more than one-quarter of her 주문.

              The various character class tables show how many 주문 of each 레벨 a character can cast per day. These
              openings for daily 주문 are called spell slots. A spellcaster always has the option to fill a higher-레벨
              spell slot with a lower-레벨 spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high enough ability score to cast 주문 that
              would otherwise be his or her due still gets the slots but must fill them with 주문 of lower 레벨.</span

              prescribed 구성요소 to complete and 트리거 it or until she abandons it. Certain other events, such as the
              effects of 마법 아이템 or 특수 공격 from 몬스터, can wipe a prepared spell from a character’s mind.</span

          <h3>비전 마법 작성</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">ARCANE MAGICAL WRITINGS</div>
          <p>
            To record an arcane spell in written form, a character uses complex notation that describes the magical
            forces involved in the spell. The writer uses the same system no matter what her native language or culture.
            However, each character uses the system in her own way. Another person’s magical writing remains
            incomprehensible to even the most powerful 마법사 until she takes time to study and decipher it.
          </p>
          <p>
            To decipher an arcane magical writing (such as a single spell in written form in another’s spellbook or on a
            scroll), a character must make a 주문학 check (DC 20 + the spell’s 레벨). If the skill check fails, the
            character cannot attempt to read that particular spell again until the next day. A
            <span style="font-style: italic">마법 읽기 </span>spell automatically deciphers a magical writing without a
            skill check. If the person who created the magical writing is on hand to help the reader, success is also
            automatic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a character deciphers a particular magical writing, she does not need to decipher it again. Deciphering
            a magical writing allows the reader to 식별 the spell and gives some idea of its effects (as explained in
            the spell 묘사). If the magical writing was a scroll and the reader can cast 비전 주문, she can attempt to
            use the scroll.
          </p>
          <p>마법사 주문 and Borrowed Spellbooks</p>
          <p>
            A 마법사 can use a borrowed spellbook to prepare a spell she already knows and has recorded in her own
            spellbook, but preparation success is not assured. First, 마법사 must decipher the writing in the book
            (see 비전 마법 작성, above). Once a spell from another spellcaster’s book is deciphered, the reader must
            make a 주문학 check (DC 15 + spell’s 레벨) to prepare the spell. If the check succeeds, 마법사 can
            prepare the spell. She must repeat the check to prepare the spell again, no matter how many times she has
            prepared it before. If the check fails, she cannot try to prepare the spell from the same source again until
            the next day. (However, as explained above, she does not need to repeat a check to decipher the writing.)
          </p>
          <p>Adding 주문 to a 마법사’s Spellbook</p>
          <p>
            마법사 can add 새로운 주문 to their spellbooks through several methods. If a 마법사 has chosen to specialize
            in a 학파 of magic, she can learn 주문 only from 학파 whose 주문 she can cast.

              >마법사 공연 a certain amount of spell research between adventures. Each time a character attains a new

              레벨 she can cast. If she has chosen to specialize in a 학파 of magic, one of the two free 주문 must be
              from her specialty 학파.</span

            ><span>
              A 마법사 can also add a spell to her book whenever she encounters one on a magic scroll or in another
              마법사’s spellbook. No matter what the spell’s source, 마법사 must first decipher the magical writing
              (see 비전 마법 작성, above). Next, she must spend a day studying the spell. At the end of the day, she
              must make a 주문학 check (DC 15 + spell’s 레벨). A 마법사 who has specialized in a 학파 of 주문 gains a +2
              보너스 on 주문학 check if the new spell is from her specialty 학파. She cannot, however, learn any 주문
              from her prohibited 학파. If the check succeeds, 마법사 understands the spell and can copy it into her
              spellbook (see Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook, below). The process leaves a spellbook that was
              copied from unharmed, but a spell successfully copied from a magic scroll disappears from the
              parchment.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            If the check fails, 마법사 cannot understand or copy the spell. She cannot attempt to learn or copy that
            spell again until she gains another rank in 주문학. A spell that was being copied from a scroll does not
            vanish from the scroll.
          </p>
          <p>
            In most cases, 마법사 돌격 a fee for the privilege of copying 주문 from their spellbooks. This fee is
            usually equal to the spell’s 레벨 × 50 gp.

            ><span>
              A spell takes up one page of the spellbook per spell 레벨. Even a 0-레벨 spell (cantrip) takes one page. A

          </p>
          <p>
            Note that a 마법사 does not have to pay these costs in time or gold for 주문 she gains for free at each
            new 레벨.
          </p>
          <p>Replacing and Copying Spellbooks</p>
          <p>
            A 마법사 can use the procedure for learning a spell to reconstruct a lost spellbook. If she already has a
            particular spell prepared, she can write it directly into a new book at a cost of 100 gp per page (as noted
            in Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook, above). The process wipes the prepared spell from her mind, just as
            casting it would. If she does not have the spell prepared, she can prepare it from a borrowed spellbook and
            then write it into a new book.
          </p>
          <p>
            Duplicating an existing spellbook uses the same procedure as replacing it, but the task is much easier. The
            time requirement and cost per page are halved.
          </p>
          <p>Selling a Spellbook</p>
          <p>
            Captured spellbooks can be sold for a gp amount equal to one-half the cost of purchasing and inscribing the
            주문 within (that is, one-half of 100 gp per page of 주문). A spellbook entirely filled with 주문(that is,
            with one hundred pages of 주문 inscribed in it) is worth 5,000 gp.

            신성 spellcasters prepare their 주문 in largely the same manner as 마법사 do, but with a few differences.
            The relevant ability for 신성 주문 is 지혜. To prepare a 신성 spell, a character must have a 지혜 score of

              A 신성 spellcaster chooses and prepares 주문 ahead of time, just as a 마법사 does. However, a 신성
              spellcaster does not require a period of rest to prepare 주문. Instead, the character chooses a particular
              part of the day to pray and receive 주문. The time is usually associated with some daily event. If some
              event prevents a character from praying at the proper time, he must do so as soon as possible. If the

              A 신성 spellcaster selects and prepares 주문 ahead of time through 기도 and meditation at a particular
              time of day. The time required to prepare 주문 is the same as it is for a 마법사(1 hour), as is the
              requirement for a relatively peaceful 환경. A 신성 spellcaster does not have to prepare all his 주문 at
              once. However, the character’s mind is considered fresh only during his or her first daily spell
              preparation, so a 신성 spellcaster cannot fill a slot that is empty because he or she has 주문 시전 or
              abandoned a previously prepared spell.</span

            신성 spellcasters do not require spellbooks. However, such a character’s spell selection is limited to the
            주문 on the list for his or her class. 사제, 드루이드, 성기사, and 레인저 have separate spell lists. A 사제
            also has access to two domains determined during his character creation. Each domain gives him access to a
            domain spell at each spell 레벨 from 1st to 9th, as well as a special granted power. With access to two
            domain 주문 at each spell 레벨—one from each of his two domains—a 사제 must prepare, as an 추가 계열 spell,
            one or the other each day for each 레벨 of spell he can cast. If a domain spell is not on 사제 spell
            list, it can be prepared only in a domain spell slot.

          <p>
            These openings for daily 주문 are called spell slots. A spellcaster always has the option to fill a
            higher-레벨 spell slot with a lower 레벨 spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high enough ability score to cast
            주문 that would otherwise be his or her due still gets the slots but must fill them with 주문 of lower 레벨.

            신성 주문 can be written down and deciphered just as 비전 주문 can (see 비전 마법 작성, above). Any
            character with 주문학 skill can attempt to decipher 신성 magical writing and 식별 it. However, only
            characters who have the spell in question (in its 신성 form) on their class spell list can cast a 신성 spell
            from a scroll.

              A 신성 spellcaster also can research a spell independently, much as an arcane spellcaster can. Only the

          <span style="font-weight: 700">Spell-Like 능력:</span
          ><span>
            Usually, a spell-like ability works just like the spell of that 이름. A few spell-like 능력 are unique;
            these are explained in the text where they are described.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          A spell-like ability has no verbal, somatic, or material component, nor does it require a focus or have an XP
          cost. The user activates it mentally. 갑옷 never affects a spell-like ability’s use, even if the ability
          resembles an arcane spell with a somatic component.
        </p>
        <p>
          A spell-like ability has a 시전 시간 of 1 standard action unless noted otherwise in the ability or spell 묘사.
          In all other ways, a spell-like ability functions just like a spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spell-like 능력 are subject to 주문 저항 and to being dispelled by
          <span style="font-style: italic">마법 무효화</span>. They do not function in 범위 where magic is suppressed or
          negated. Spell-like 능력 cannot be used to counterspell, nor can they be counterspelled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some creatures are actually 소서러 of a sort. They cast 비전 주문 as 소서러 do, using 구성요소 when required.
          In fact, an individual creature could have some spell-like 능력 and also cast other 주문 as a 소서러.

            These 능력 cannot be disrupted in 전투, as 주문 can, and they generally do not provoke 기회 공격.
            Supernatural 능력 are not subject to 주문 저항, 주문 무효화, or to being dispelled by
            <span style="font-style: italic">마법 무효화</span>, and do not function in 범위 where magic is suppressed
            or negated.</span

          ><span>
            These 능력 cannot be disrupted in 전투, as 주문 can, and they generally do not provoke 기회 공격. Effects or
            범위 that negate or disrupt magic have no effect on extraordinary 능력. They are not subject to dispelling,
            and they function normally in an <span style="font-style: italic">대마법 보호장. </span>Indeed,
            extraordinary 능력 do not qualify as magical, though they may break the laws of physics.</span

          <span style="font-weight: 700">Natural 능력:</span

            This category includes 능력 a creature has because of its physical nature. Natural 능력 are those not
            otherwise designated as extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like.</span
