      <p>Kobolds are short, reptilian humanoids with cowardly and sadistic tendencies.</p>
      <p>
        A kobold’s scaly skin ranges from dark rusty brown to a rusty black color. It has glowing red eyes. Its tail is
        nonprehensile. Kobolds wear ragged clothing, favoring red and orange. A kobold is 2 to 2-1/2 feet tall and
        weighs 35 to 45 pounds. Kobolds speak Draconic with a voice that sounds like that of a yapping dog.
      </p>
      <section id="h2-2-combat">
        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>
          Kobolds like to attack with overwhelming odds—at least two to one—or trickery; should the odds fall below this
          threshold, they usually flee. However, they attack gnomes on sight if their numbers are equal.
        </p>
        <p>
          They begin a fight by slinging bullets, closing only when they can see that their foes have been weakened.
          Whenever they can, kobolds set up ambushes near trapped areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>빛에 민감함 (범):</strong> Kobolds are dazzled in bright sunlight or within the radius of a
          <i>daylight</i> spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>스킬:</strong> Kobolds have a +2 racial bonus on Craft (trapmaking), Profession (miner), and Search
          checks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The kobold warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11,
          Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>도전 지수:</strong> Kobolds with levels in NPC classes have a CR equal to their character level –3.

        Six of the beast’s tentacles are shorter arms about 30 feet long; the remaining two are nearly 60 feet long and
        covered with barbs. Its beaklike mouth is located where the tentacles meet the lower portion of its body.
      </p>
      <p>Krakens speak Common and Aquan.</p>
      <section id="h2-5-combat">
        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>
          Krakens strike their opponents with their barbed tentacles, then grab and crush with their arms or drag
          victims into their huge jaws. An opponent can make sunder attempts against a kraken’s tentacles or arms as if
          they were weapons. A kraken’s tentacles have 20 hit points, and its arms have 10 hit points. If a kraken is
          currently grappling a target with one tentacle or arm, it usually uses another limb to make its attack of
          opportunity against the sunder attempt. Severing a kraken’s tentacle or arm deals damage to the kraken equal
          to half the limb’s full normal hit points. A kraken usually withdraws from combat if it loses both tentacles
          or three of its arms. A kraken regrows severed limbs in 1d10+10 days.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>향상된 잡아채기 (범):</strong> To use this ability, the kraken must hit with an arm or tentacle
          attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If
          it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>수축 (범):</strong> A kraken deals automatic arm or tentacle damage with a successful grapple check.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>분출 (범):</strong> A kraken can jet backward once per round as a full-round action, at a speed of 280
          feet. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>먹물 구름 (범):</strong> A kraken can emit a cloud of jet-black ink in an 80-foot spread once per
          minute as a free action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the kraken normally uses to escape a
          fight that is going badly. Creatures within the cloud are considered to be in darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>유사주문 능력:</strong> 1/day—<i>control weather, control winds, dominate animal</i> (DC 18),
          <i>resist energy.</i> Caster level 9th. The save DC is Charisma-based.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>스킬:</strong> A kraken has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or
          avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
          the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

        The krenshar is a strange, catlike carnivore with extremely flexible skin on its head. A typical krenshar
        measures 4 or 5 feet in length with a long, narrow head. It weighs about 175 pounds.
      </p>

        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>
          Krenshars use solitary scouts to drive prey into the waiting clutches of the pride. The scout appears from
          hiding, uses its scare ability, then chases the fleeing target to join the attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>겁주기 (범, 초):</strong> As a standard action, a krenshar can pull the skin back from its head,
          revealing the musculature and bony structures of its skull. This alone is usually sufficient to scare away
          foes (treat as a Bluff check with a +3 bonus).
        </p>
        <p>
          Combining this scare ability with a loud screech produces an unsettling effect that works like a
          <i>scare</i> spell from a 3rd-level caster (Will DC 13 partial). A creature that successfully saves cannot be
          affected again by the same krenshar’s scare ability for 24 hours. The shriek does not affect other krenshars.
          This is a supernatural, sonic mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
        </p>
        <p><strong>스킬:</strong> Krenshars have a +4 racial bonus on Jump and Move Silently checks.</p>

          Though a lamia is powerful and dangerous in close combat, it has no stomach for a fair fight. It uses its
          illusion abilities to lure heroes into perilous situations, and then uses its Spring Attack feat to bound out
          of the shadows and drain Wisdom from its opponents. When it has sapped the will of its victim, it uses its
          enchantment abilities to beguile and ensnare the unfortunate soul. A lamia forced into physical combat attacks
          with a dagger in one of its human hands and a pair of lion-like claws.

        <h4>전투</h4>
        <p>
          Leonals like their battles as straightforward as can be. They begin with a roar to put their foes off balance,
          then follow up with a frenzy of claw and bite attacks. They closely coordinate with others in their pride,
          watching one another’s flanks and setting up devastating attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          A leonal’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of
          overcoming damage reduction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>포효 (초):</strong> A leonal can roar up to three times per day. Each roar releases a blast in a
          60-foot cone that duplicates the effects of a <i>holy word</i> spell and deals an extra 2d6 points of sonic
          damage (Fortitude DC 20 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>덮치기 (범):</strong> If a leonal charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake
          attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>향상된 잡아채기 (범):</strong> To use this ability, a leonal must hit with its bite attack. It can
          then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
          grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.
        </p>
        <p><strong>갈퀴질 (범):</strong> Attack bonus +20 melee, damage 1d6+8.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>유사주문 능력:</strong> At will—<i>detect thoughts, fireball</i> (DC 15), <i>hold monster</i> (DC
          17)<i>, polymorph, wall of force;</i> 3/day—<i>cure critical wounds</i> (DC 16)<i
            >, neutralize poison, remove disease;</i
          >
          1/day—<i>heal</i> (DC 18). Caster level 10th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>치유의 손길 (초):</strong> As the paladin class feature, except that each day, a leonal can heal an
          amount of damage equal to its full normal hit points.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>보호 오라 (초):</strong> Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability
          provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of
          the leonal. Otherwise, it functions as a <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect and a
          <i>lesser globe of invulnerability,</i> both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals leonal’s HD). (The
          defensive benefits from the circle are not included in a leonal’s statistics block.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>동물과 대화 (초):</strong> This ability works like <i>speak with animals</i> (caster level 8th) but is
          a free action and does not require sound.
        </p>
        <p><strong>스킬:</strong> Leonals have a +4 racial bonus on Balance, Hide, and Move Silently checks.</p>

      <h1>리치</h1>
      <p>
        A lich is an undead spellcaster, usually a wizard or sorcerer but sometimes a cleric or other spellcaster, who
        has used its magical powers to unnaturally extend its life.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lich is a gaunt and skeletal humanoid with withered flesh stretched tight across horribly visible bones. Its
        eyes have long ago been lost to decay, but bright pinpoints of crimson light burn on in the empty sockets.
      </p>
      <p>Liches speak Common plus any other languages they knew in life.</p>
      <section id="h2-18-creating-a-lich">
        <h2>리치 만들기</h2>
        <p>
          “Lich” is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid creature (referred to hereafter as the base
          creature), provided it can create the required phylactery; see The Lich’s Phylactery, below.
        </p>
        <p>A lich has all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>크기와 유형:</strong> The creature’s type changes to undead. Do not recalculate base attack bonus,
          saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged.
        </p>
        <p><strong>히트 다이스:</strong> Increase all current and future Hit Dice to d12s.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>방어도:</strong> A lich has a +5 natural armor bonus or the base creature’s natural armor bonus,
          whichever is better.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>공격:</strong> A lich has a touch attack that it can use once per round. If the base creature can use
          weapons, the lich retains this ability. A creature with natural weapons retains those natural weapons. A lich
          fighting without weapons uses either its touch attack or its primary natural weapon (if it has any). A lich
          armed with a weapon uses its touch or a weapon, as it desires.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>전력 공격:</strong> A lich fighting without weapons uses either its touch attack (see above) or its
          natural weapons (if it has any). If armed with a weapon, it usually uses the weapon as its primary attack
          along with a touch as a natural secondary attack, provided it has a way to make that attack (either a free
          hand or a natural weapon that it can use as a secondary attack).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>피해:</strong> A lich without natural weapons has a touch attack that uses negative energy to deal
          1d8+5 points of damage to living creatures; a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 lich’s HD + lich’s Cha modifier) halves
          the damage. A lich with natural weapons can use its touch attack or its natural weaponry, as it prefers. If it
          chooses the latter, it deals 1d8+5 points of extra damage on one natural weapon attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>특수 공격:</strong> A lich retains all the base creature’s special attacks and gains those described
          below. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 lich’s HD + lich’s Cha modifier unless otherwise noted.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>공포 오라 (초):</em> Liches are shrouded in a dreadful aura of death and evil. Creatures of less than 5 HD
          in a 60-foot radius that look at the lich must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by a
          <i>fear</i> spell from a sorcerer of the lich’s level. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected
          again by the same lich’s aura for 24 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>마비의 손길 (초):</em> Any living creature a lich hits with its touch attack must succeed on a Fortitude
          save or be permanently paralyzed. <i>Remove paralysis</i> or any spell that can remove a curse can free the
          victim (see the <i>bestow curse</i> spell description).
        </p>
        <p>
          The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a lich seems dead, though a DC 20 Spot check or a DC 15
          Heal check reveals that the victim is still alive..
        </p>
        <p><em>주문:</em> A lich can cast any spells it could cast while alive.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>특성:</strong> A lich retains all the base creature’s special qualities and gains those described
          below.
        </p>
        <p><strong>구마 저항 (범):</strong> A lich has +4 turn resistance.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>피해 축소 (초):</strong> A lich’s undead body is tough, giving the creature damage reduction
          15/bludgeoning and magic. Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming
          damage reduction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>면역 (범):</strong> Liches have immunity to cold, electricity, polymorph (though they can use
          polymorph effects on themselves), and mind-affecting attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>능력:</strong> Increase from the base creature as follows: Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +2. Being undead, a
          lich has no Constitution score.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>스킬:</strong> Liches have a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and
          Spot checks. Otherwise same as the base creature.
        </p>
        <p><strong>집단:</strong> Solitary or troupe (1 lich, plus 2–4 vampires and 5–8 vampire spawn).</p>
        <p><strong>도전 지수:</strong> Same as the base creature + 2.</p>
        <p><strong>전리품:</strong> Standard coins; double goods; double items.</p>
        <p><strong>성향:</strong> Any evil.</p>
        <p><strong>성장:</strong> By character class.</p>
        <p><strong>레벨 보정:</strong> Same as the base creature +4.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="h2-19-lich-characters">
        <h2>리치 캐릭터</h2>
        <p>
          The process of becoming a lich is unspeakably evil and can be undertaken only by a willing character. A lich
          retains all class abilities it had in life.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="h2-20-the-lichs-phylactery">
        <h2>리치의 부적</h2>
        <p>
          An integral part of becoming a lich is creating a magic phylactery in which the character stores its life
          force. As a rule, the only way to get rid of a lich for sure is to destroy its phylactery. Unless its
          phylactery is located and destroyed, a lich reappears 1d10 days after its apparent death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each lich must make its own phylactery, which requires the Craft Wondrous Item feat. The character must be
          able to cast spells and have a caster level of 11th or higher. The phylactery costs 120,000 gp and 4,800 XP to
          create and has a caster level equal to that of its creator at the time of creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most common form of phylactery is a sealed metal box containing strips of parchment on which magical
          phrases have been transcribed. The box is Tiny and has 40 hit points, hardness 20, and a break DC of 40.
        </p>
        <p>Other forms of phylacteries can exist, such as rings, amulets, or similar items.</p>

        A typical lillend’s coils are 20 feet long. The creature weighs about 3,800 pounds. A few lillends have male
        torsos.

          Lillends are generally peaceful unless they intend vengeance against someone they believe guilty of harming,
          or even threatening, a favored art form, artwork, or artist. Then they become implacable foes. They use their
          spells and spell-like abilities to confuse and weaken opponents before entering combat. A covey of lillends
          usually discusses strategy before a battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lillend’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned
          for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>수축 (범):</strong> A lillend deals 2d6+5 points of damage with a successful grapple check.
          Constricting uses the entire lower portion of its body, so it cannot take any move actions when constricting,
          though it can still attack with its sword.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>향상된 잡아채기 (범):</strong> To use this ability, a lillend must hit with its tail slap attack. It
          can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins
          the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

        A lizardfolk is usually 6 to 7 feet tall with green, gray, or brown scales. Its tail is used for balance and is

          Lizardfolk fight as unorganized individuals. They prefer frontal assaults and massed rushes, sometimes trying
          to force foes into the water, where the lizardfolk have an advantage. If outnumbered or if their territory is
          being invaded, they set snares, plan ambushes, and make raids to hinder enemy supplies. Advanced tribes use
          more sophisticated tactics and have better traps and ambushes.

        <p>
          <strong>숨 참기:</strong> A lizardfolk can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to four times its

          <strong>스킬:</strong> Because of their tails, lizardfolk have a +4 racial bonus on Jump, Swim, and Balance

        Although humanoid in shape, locathahs are clearly more fish than human. The average locathah stands 5 feet tall
        and weighs 175 pounds. Females and males look very much alike, although the former can be recognized by the two
        ochre stripes marking their egg sacs.

          Any battle with locathahs usually begins with the creatures loosing volleys of bolts from their crossbows;
          underwater, their crossbows have a range increment of 20 feet. If they have managed to set up an ambush or
          other trap, they continue to employ crossbows for as long as possible. Otherwise, they close to bring their
          longspears into play. Although primarily used for fishing, these spears make formidable weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Locathahs lack teeth, claws, and other natural weapons, so they are not especially dangerous if unarmed. A

      <h1>라이칸스로프</h1>
      <p>
        Lycanthropes are humanoids or giants who can transform themselves into animals. In its natural form, a
        lycanthrope looks like any other members of its kind, though natural lycanthropes and those who have been
        afflicted for a long time tend to have or acquire features reminiscent of their animal forms. In animal form, a
        lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of the normal animal, but on close inspection, its eyes (which often
        glow red in the dark) show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lycanthropy can be spread like a disease. Sometimes a lycanthrope begins life as a normal humanoid or giant who
        subsequently contracts lycanthropy after being wounded by a lycanthrope. Such a creature is called an afflicted
        lycanthrope. Other lycanthropes are born as lycanthropes, and are known as natural lycanthropes.
      </p>
      <section id="h4-29-combat">
        <h4>전투</h4>
        <p>
          A lycanthrope in its humanoid (or giant) form uses whatever tactics and weapons are favored by others of its
          kind, though it tends to be slightly more aggressive. A lycanthrope possesses the senses of its animal form,
          including scent and low-light vision, and it has a deep empathy for (and ability to communicate with) animals
          of its animal form. An afflicted lycanthrope damaged in combat may be overwhelmed by rage, causing it to
          change to its animal form involuntarily.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lycanthrope in animal form fights like the animal it resembles, although its bite carries the disease of
          lycanthropy. It is preternaturally cunning and strong, and possesses damage reduction that is overcome only by
          silvered weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, a natural lycanthrope (or an afflicted lycanthrope that has become aware of its affliction) can
          assume a hybrid form that is a mix of its humanoid and animal forms. A hybrid has hands and can use weapons,
          but it can also attack with its teeth and claws. A hybrid can spread lycanthropy with its bite, and it has the
          same damage reduction that its animal form possesses.

          Werebears in humanoid form tend to be stout, well-muscled, and hairy. Their brown hair is thick, and males
          usually wear beards. They may have reddish, blond, ivory, or black hair, matching the color of the ursine
          form. They dress in simple cloth and leather garments that are easy to remove, repair, or replace
        </p>

          <h4>전투</h4>
          <p>
            Werebears fight just as brown bears do in animal form. In humanoid or hybrid form, they favor large, heavy
            weapons such as greataxes or greatswords. The werebear’s greataxe is a Medium weapon, so it can wield the
            axe in one hand in hybrid form.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>형태 대체 (초):</strong> A werebear can assume the form of a brown bear or a bear-humanoid hybrid.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>곰과의 교감 (범):</strong> Communicate with bears and dire bears, and +4 racial bonus on
            Charisma-based checks against bears and dire bears.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>늑대인간화 저주 (초):</strong> Any humanoid or giant hit by a werebear’s bite attack in animal or
            hybrid form must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract lycanthropy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>향상된 잡아채기 (범):</strong> To use this ability, a werebear must be in bear form and must hit
            with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
            opportunity.
          </p>
          <p><strong>스킬:</strong> Werebears have a +4 racial bonus on Swim checks in any bear form.</p>
          <p>
            The werebear presented here is a 1st-level human warrior and natural lycanthrope, using the following base
            ability scores: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

          A wererat in humanoid form tends to be a thin, wiry individual of shorter than average height. The eyes
          constantly dart around, and the nose and mouth may twitch if he or she is excited. Males often have thin,
          ragged mustaches.

          Werewolf lords can assume a hybrid form as well as an animal form. In dire wolf form, they can trip just as
          normal wolves do. In hybrid form, they can wield weapons or fight with their claws.

          Dire wereboars in giant form look much like normal hill giants, though slightly stockier, and with coarser,
          stiffer hair and stiff. The dire wereboar described here is based on a hill giant and natural lycanthrope with
          normal ability scores for a hill giant.

        <h2>라이칸스로프 만들기</h2>
        <p>
          “Lycanthrope” is a template that can be added to any humanoid or giant (referred to hereafter as the base
          creature). The lycanthrope template can be inherited (for natural lycanthropes) or acquired (for afflicted
          lycanthropes). Becoming a lycanthrope is very much like multiclassing as an animal and gaining the appropriate
          Hit Dice.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>크기와 유형:</strong> The base creature’s type does not change, but the creature gains the
          shapechanger subtype. The lycanthrope takes on the characteristics of some type of carnivorous or omnivorous
          creature of the animal type (referred to hereafter as the base animal).
        </p>
        <p>
          This animal can be any predator, scavenger, or omnivore whose size is within one size category of the base
          creature’s size (Small, Medium, or Large for a Medium base creature). Lycanthropes can also adopt a hybrid
          shape that combines features of the base creature and the base animal. A lycanthrope’s hybrid form is the same
          size as the base animal or the base creature, whichever is larger.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lycanthrope uses either the base creature’s or the base animal’s statistics and special abilities in
          addition to those described here.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>히트 다이스 및 히트 포인트:</strong> Same as the base creature plus those of the base animal. To
          calculate total hit points, apply Constitution modifiers according to the score the lycanthrope has in each
          form.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>속도:</strong> Same as the base creature or base animal, depending on which form the lycanthrope is
          using. Hybrids use the base creature’s speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>방어도:</strong> The base creature’s natural armor bonus increases by +2 in all forms. In hybrid form,
          the lycanthrope’s natural armor bonus is equal to the natural armor bonus of the base animal or the base
          creature, whichever is better.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>기본 공격/그래플:</strong> Add the base attack bonus for the base animal to the base attack bonus for
          the base creature. The lycanthrope’s grapple bonus uses its attack bonus and modifiers for Strength and size
          depending on the lycanthrope’s form.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>공격:</strong> Same as the base creature or base animal, depending on which form the lycanthrope is
          using. A lycanthrope in hybrid form gains two claw attacks and a bite attack as natural weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
          These weapons deal damage based on the hybrid form’s size. A hybrid may attack with a weapon and a bite, or
          may attack with its natural weapons. The bite attack of a hybrid is a secondary attack.

          lycanthrope more feats than a character of its total Hit Dice would normally be entitled to; if this occurs,
          any “extra” feats are denoted as bonus feats.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s possible that a lycanthrope cannot meet the prerequisites for all its feats when in humanoid form. If
          this occurs, the lycanthrope still has the feats, but cannot use them when in humanoid form. A lycanthrope
          receives Iron Will as a bonus feat.

          This is a reflection of how these animals are perceived, not any innate quality of the animal itself, so the

        <h2>병으로서의 늑대인간화</h2>
        <p>
          When a character contracts lycanthropy through a lycanthrope’s bite (see above), no symptoms appear until the
          first night of the next full moon. On that night, the afflicted character involuntarily assumes animal form
          and forgets his or her own identity, temporarily becoming an NPC. The character remains in animal form,
          assuming the appropriate alignment, until the next dawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          The character’s actions during this first episode are dictated by the alignment of its animal form. The
          character remembers nothing about the entire episode (or subsequent episodes) unless he succeeds on a DC 15
          Wisdom check, in which case he becomes aware of his lycanthropic condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thereafter, the character is subject to involuntary transformation under the full moon and whenever damaged in
          combat. He or she feels an overwhelming rage building up and must succeed on a Control Shape check (see below)
          to resist changing into animal form. Any player character not yet aware of his or her lycanthropic condition
          temporarily becomes an NPC during an involuntary change, and acts according to the alignment of his or her
          animal form.
        </p>
        <p>
          A character with awareness of his condition retains his identity and does not lose control of his actions if
          he changes. However, each time he changes to his animal form, he must make a Will save (DC 15 + number of
          times he has been in animal form) or permanently assume the alignment of his animal form in all shapes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a character becomes aware of his affliction, he can now voluntarily attempt to change to animal or hybrid
          form, using the appropriate Control Shape check DC. An attempt is a standard action and can be made each
          round. Any voluntary change to animal or hybrid form immediately and permanently changes the character’s
          alignment to that of the appropriate lycanthrope.
        </p>
        <section id="h4-46-changing-form">
          <h4>형태 변환</h4>
          <p>
            Changing form is a standard action. If the change is involuntary, the character performs the change on his
            next turn following the triggering event. Changing to animal or hybrid form ruins the character’s armor and
            clothing (including any items worn) if the new form is larger than the character’s natural form; carried
            items are simply dropped. Characters can hastily doff clothing while changing, but not armor. Magic armor
            survives the change if it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. An afflicted character who is not aware of his
            condition remains in animal form until the next dawn. An afflicted character who is aware of his or her
            condition (see above) can try to resume humanoid form following a change (voluntary or involuntary) with a
            Control Shape check, but if he fails his check, he remains in animal (or hybrid) form until the following
            dawn.

        <section id="h4-47-curing-lycanthropy">
          <h4>늑대인간화 치유</h4>
          <p>
            An afflicted character who eats a sprig of belladonna (also called wolfsbane) within 1 hour of a
            lycanthrope’s attack can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save to shake off the affliction. If a healer administers
            the herb, use the character’s save bonus or the healer’s Heal modifier, whichever is higher. The character
            gets only one chance, no matter how much belladonna is consumed. The belladonna must be reasonably fresh
            (picked within the last week).
          </p>
          <p>
            However, fresh or not, belladonna is toxic. The character must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or take 1d6
            points of Strength damage. One minute later, the character must succeed on a second DC 13 save or take an
            additional 2d6 points of Strength damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <i>remove disease</i> or <i>heal</i> spell cast by a cleric of 12th level or higher also cures the
            affliction, provided the character receives the spell within three days of the lycanthrope’s attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only other way to remove the affliction is to cast <i>remove curse</i> or <i>break enchantment</i> on
            the character during one of the three days of the full moon. After receiving the spell, the character must
            succeed on a DC 20 Will save to break the curse (the caster knows if the spell works). If the save fails,
            the process must be repeated.

          <p>Characters undergoing this cure are often kept bound or confined in cages until the cure takes effect.</p>
          <p>Only afflicted lycanthropes can be cured of lycanthropy.</p>

        <p>
          Becoming a lycanthrope does not change a character’s favored class but usually changes alignment (see above).
          This alignment change may cause characters of certain classes to lose some of their class features.
        </p>
        <p>Lycanthrope characters possess the following racial traits.</p>
        <p>
          — +2 Wisdom. Physical abilities are increased by the animal form’s ability modifiers when a lycanthrope
          changes to its hybrid or animal forms.
        </p>
        <p>—Size same as the base creature or the base animal form.</p>
        <p>—Low-light vision in any form.</p>
        <p>—Scent in any form.</p>
        <p>
          —Racial Hit Dice: A lycanthrope adds the Hit Dice of its animal form to its base Hit Dice for race, level, and
          class. These additional Hit Dice modify the lycanthrope’s base attack bonus and base saving throw bonuses
          accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          —Racial Skills: A lycanthrope adds skill points for its animal Hit Dice much as if it had multiclassed into
          the animal type. It gains skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die of the animal form.
          Any skills that appear in the animal’s description are treated as class skills for the lycanthrope’s animal
          levels. The lycanthrope’s maximum skill ranks are equal to its animal form Hit Dice + its racial Hit Dice (if
          any) + its class levels + 3. Any racial skill adjustments of the lycanthrope’s base race and its animal form
          (but not conditional adjustments) are added to its skill modifiers in any form.
        </p>
        <p>
          —Racial Feats: Add the animal’s Hit Dice to the base character’s own Hit Dice to determine how many feats the
          character has. All lycanthropes gain Iron Will as a bonus feat.
        </p>
        <p>— +2 natural armor bonus in any form.</p>
        <p>
          —Special Qualities (see above): Alternate form, lycanthropic empathy, curse of lycanthropy (in animal or
          hybrid form only).
        </p>
        <p>—Afflicted lycanthrope: damage reduction 5/silver (in animal or hybrid form only).</p>
        <p>—Natural lycanthrope: damage reduction 10/silver (in animal or hybrid form only).</p>
        <p>—Automatic Languages: As base creature.</p>
        <p>—Favored Class: Same as the base creature.</p>
        <p>—Level adjustment: Same as the base creature +2 (afflicted) or +3 (natural).</p>

          Any character who has contracted lycanthropy and is aware of his condition can learn Control Shape as a class
          skill. (An afflicted lycanthrope not yet aware of his condition can attempt Control Shape checks untrained.)
          This skill determines whether an afflicted lycanthrope can control his shape. A natural lycanthrope does not
          need this skill, since it has full control over its shape.

        <p>
          <strong>판정 (비자발적 변경):</strong> An afflicted character must make a check at moonrise each night of the
          full moon to resist involuntarily assuming animal form. An injured character must also check for an
          involuntary change after accumulating enough damage to reduce his hit points by one-quarter and again after
          each additional one-quarter lost.

          On a failed check, the character must remain in animal form until the next dawn, when he automatically returns
          to his base form. A character aware of his condition may make one attempt to return to humanoid form (see
