          Your body automatically adapts to hostile 환경. You can adapt to underwater, extremely hot, extremely cold, or
          airless 환경, allowing you to survive as if you were a creature native to that 환경. You can breathe and 이동
          (though 페널티 to 이동 and 공격, if any for a particular 환경, remain), and you take no 피해 simply from
          being in that 환경. You need not specify what 환경 you are adapting to when you manifest this power; simply
          activate it, and your body will instantly adapt to any hostile 환경 as needed throughout 지속시간.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can somewhat adapt to extreme environmental features such as acid, lava, fire, and electricity. Any
          environmental feature that normally directly deals 1 or more 주사위 of 피해 per round deals you only half the
          usual amount of 피해.

          You create an affinity feedback loop with all creatures within 범위. While 지속시간 lasts, affected
          creatures take all 피해(including ability 피해) as you do and 치료 all wounds as you do. 히트 포인트 gained
          or lost persist after this power ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creatures in 거리 are also subject to magical and psionic effects of 3rd 레벨 or lower. Creatures that have an
          affinity to you gain a 내성 굴림 against each new power transferred through the
          <span style="font-style: italic">친화의 장 </span>as if the power were manifested upon them normally. All
          magical and psionic effects transferred to subjects fade at the end of this power’s 지속시간, although
          instantaneous effects remain. If you suddenly become immune to a particular effect or power, the effect or
          power to which you are immune cannot be transferred to creatures that have affinity to you.

          You know where you are in relation to a fixed starting point, which is essential for setting up a mishap-free

          distance and route (physical or psychoportive) back to a fixed starting point. The “anchored” starting point
          is your exact location when you manifest the power. To designate other anchored starting points, you must
          manifest this power multiple times and be present at the desired locations when you do so.

          You forge a psychometabolic affinity with an idealized animal form, thereby boosting one of your 능력 점수
          (choose either 근력, 민첩, 건강, 지능, 지혜, or 매력). The power grants a +4 enhancement 보너스 to the ability
          score you choose, adding the usual benefits provided by a high ability 보너스. Because you are emulating the
          idealized form of an animal, you also take on minor aspects of the animal you choose. If you choose to
          increase the ability you use to manifest powers, you do not gain the benefit of an increased ability score
          long enough to gain any 보너스 파워 포인트 for a high ability score, but the save DCs of your powers increase
          for 지속시간 of this power.

          Your pointing finger turns black as obsidian. A creature touched by you is partially assimilated into your
          form and takes 20d6 points of 피해. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer 히트 포인트 by this power is killed,
          entirely assimilated into your form, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. An assimilated creature’s 장비
          is unaffected.

        <p>
          A creature that is partially assimilated into your form (that is, a creature that has at least 1 hit point

          1 hour.

          A creature that is completely assimilated grants you a number of 임시 히트 포인트 equal to 피해 you dealt
          and a +4 보너스 to each of your 능력 점수 for 1 hour. If the assimilated creature knows 사이오닉 파워, you gain
          지식 of one of its powers for 1 hour. You gain some semblance of a creature you completely 동화 for 1 hour,
          granting you a +10 보너스 on 변장 checks made to appear as that creature during that time.

        <p>
          You lead a caravan into 영적 세계, leaving 물질 세계 behind. Since 영적 세계 touches upon other 이세계, you
          can travel astrally to any of these other 이세계 as you 소원, but only if you know your way (see below).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can bring other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects have each manifested
          <span style="font-style: italic">영적 여행자 </span>and are linked hand to hand with you at the time of the
          <span style="font-style: italic">영적 마차</span>’s manifestation. These fellow travelers are dependent upon
          you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey that causes you to
          break hand-to-hand contact, your companions are stranded wherever you leave them. Because 이세계 are a
          dangerous place, those who lead <span style="font-style: italic">영적 마차 </span>usually choose to manifest
          this power only if they have a large party of travelers assembled. Sometimes groups of lower-레벨 adventurers
          may hire you to lead forays beyond 물질 세계.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <span style="font-style: italic">영적 마차 </span>power lasts while you and your fellow travelers maintain
          your original formation, until (1) you reach your intended destination plane, (2) you desire to end the power
          while still traversing 영적 세계, (3) you or anyone traveling with you breaks the hand-to-hand chain
          connecting the travelers for 2 consecutive rounds, or (4) the power is terminated by some outside means, such
          as <span style="font-style: italic">사이오닉 무효화</span>. When the power ends, you and your fellow travelers
          halt in whatever portion of 영적 세계 you happen to be traversing (영적 세계 is in many ways subjective in
          location; in any event, one place on the Astral looks much like any other).
        </p>
        <p>
          While you are traveling through 영적 세계, those natives who happen to glimpse you and your fellow travelers
          perceive you to be moving at a 속도 of 30 feet (you can’t 달리기), with you flying in the lead and your fellow
          travelers strung out behind you, each linked to the next by one hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on your 지식 of 이세계, your journey through the subjective space that is 영적 세계 may take a
          longer or shorter period of time. For each 24 hours you travel, make a 지식(이세계) check. Unless a
          location is particularly hard to find and well guarded, or conversely easy to find and well advertised, the
          average DC for an <span style="font-style: italic">영적 마차 </span>journey should be set at 20. You cannot
          take 20 on this check, though you can take 10. Each check may be modified by your degree of familiarity with
          the destination or by some connection you have with the place; see the tables below.

          Each successful check indicates that you are one step closer to your goal. To finally arrive at your location,

          first 12 days, you can continue to make one check per day until you get the requisite six successes within a
          span of 12 consecutive days). When you successfully make the requisite number of checks, the journey ends, and

            those adjacent to each other in the caravan (being linked by hand is not required if this membrane is used).
            You remain visible within the translucent, amorphous enclosure. You can pick up or drop willing passengers,
            easily reaching through the film. Anything you hold is enveloped by the film. Any 공격 made through the

          This power creates one 1 레벨 영적 구조물 of solidified ectoplasm that 공격 your enemies. It appears where you
          designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It 공격 your opponents to the best of its ability. As a free
          action, you can mentally direct it not to 공격, to 공격 particular enemies, or to 공연 other actions. 영적
          구조물 acts normally on the last round of the power’s 지속시간 and dissipates at the end of its turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          영적 구조물 are not summoned; they are created on the plane you inhabit (using ectoplasm drawn from 영적

          This power weaves strands of astral ectoplasm into a crystal containing the seed of your living mind (hardness
          1 and 1 hit point). You can have only one <span style="font-style: italic">영적 씨앗 </span>in existence at
          any one time. Until such time as you perish, the <span style="font-style: italic">영적 씨앗 </span>(also
          called the storage crystal) is utterly inert. If you are slain at some later date, your soul transfers into
          the storage crystal, which begins to dimly glow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon transference, your physical remains (should they still exist) become inert matter and cannot thereafter
          be restored to life. The transfer from the slain body to the
          <span style="font-style: italic">영적 씨앗 </span>works over any distance, physical or extradimensional.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once your body’s physical demise activates the storage crystal, you have 능력 of a 정신결정 of the appropriate
          레벨, plus all the powers you knew and the maximum 파워 포인트 you possessed when
          <span style="font-style: italic">영적 씨앗 </span>was manifested—but you also have a negative 레벨 that cannot
          be healed and that does not convert to real 레벨 손실 in your current crystalline form. You have thirty days
          to grow an organic body, after which time your sentience fades and your soul passes on if it hasn’t entered a
          new body.
        </p>
        <p>
          To grow a body, you (in the storage crystal) must spend ten days in uninterrupted solitude. The body’s
          constituent parts are pulled as ectoplasm from 영적 세계, then slowly molded and transformed into a living,
          breathing body that is an exact duplicate of your body at the time you manifested
          <span style="font-style: italic">영적 씨앗 </span>(the crystal itself breaks down and becomes a part of the
          new organic body). When the tenth day ends, you completely and totally inhabit the new body. You possess all
          능력 you possessed when <span style="font-style: italic">영적 씨앗 </span>was manifested, at one 레벨 lower,
          but you have none of your 장비.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the body is struck for any amount of 피해 during the ten-day period when it is growing, it is destroyed and
          your soul passes on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conceivably, you could manifest <span style="font-style: italic">정신 개폐 </span>to utilize a temporary body,
          but only an evil creature would smash his own temporarily empty storage crystal to permanently usurp a
          subject’s organic body (unless the subject is itself irredeemably evil).

          This power allows you or a creature you touch to participate in an 영적 마차 created through use of the
          <span style="font-style: italic">영적 마차 </span>power. While participating in a journey allowed by the
          <span style="font-style: italic">영적 마차 </span>power, you must hold the hand of both your fellow passenger
          ahead of you (or the caravan leader) and your fellow passenger behind you (unless you happen to be the last in
          the hand-linked line). If you or any one of your fellow passengers breaks the hand-to-hand link for 2
          consecutive rounds, the impetus through 영적 세계 provided by
          <span style="font-style: italic">영적 마차 </span>fails. See the

        <p>
          All those who are part of the caravan who are capable of performing purely mental actions, such as manifesting
          a power, may do so while maintaining hand-to-hand contact with their fellow travelers. When 영적 여행자 begin
          their journey, each one is connected to 물질 세계 by an insubstantial silvery cord. Very few 무기 exist that
          can 피해 a silvery cord.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last creature in the line of those making up the caravan is sometimes referred to as the rear guard,
          because he or she has one hand free and can use it to wield a weapon without relinquishing his or her grip on
          the next traveler in line. The weightless, subjective 환경 of 영적 세계 allows the caravan to flex and bend as
          necessary to bring the rear guard’s weapon to bear.

          You plant a compelling 끌림 in the mind of the subject. 끌림 can be toward a particular person or an
          object. The subject will take reasonable steps to meet, get close to, attend, or find the object of its
          implanted 끌림. For 목적 of this power, “reasonable” means that, while attracted, the subject doesn’t
          suffer from blind obsession. He will act on this 끌림 only when not engaged in 전투. The subject won’t 공연
          obviously suicidal actions. He can still recognize danger but will not flee unless the threat is immediate. If

          highest 기본 공격 보너스 on 명중 굴림, and you can apply your full 근력 보너스 to 피해. If you bite in
          addition to making other 공격, the bite is a secondary 공격.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are not a Medium creature, your bite 공격’s base 피해 varies as follows: Fine 1d2, Diminutive 1d3, Tiny

          By manifesting this power, you generate psychic static, interfering with the ability of other psionic
          characters to manifest their powers or use 유사사이오닉 능력(you are not affected by your own
          <span style="font-style: italic">캐텁시 </span>manifestation). All psionic activity within 범위 requires 4
          more 파워 포인트 to manifest than normal, unless a character makes a Will save each time he attempts to
          manifest a power. Using a psi-like ability becomes a full-round action, instead of a standard action, in a
          <span style="font-style: italic">캐텁시 </span>field. If two or more fields of
          <span style="font-style: italic">캐텁시 </span>overlap, the effects are not cumulative.

        <p>
          The limit on the number of 파워 포인트 a subject can spend on a power remains in effect; thus, a subject may
          not be able to manifest its highest-레벨 powers. If manifesting a power would cause the manifester to exceed
          his available 파워 포인트 or his spending limits, the manifestation fails automatically, but no 파워 포인트
          are expended.

          You can see and hear a distant location almost as if you were there. You don’t need line of sight or line of
          effect, but the locale must be known—a place familiar to you or an obvious one, such as behind a door, around
          a corner, or in a grove of trees. Once you have selected the locale, the focus of your
          <span style="font-style: italic">투시 감각 </span>doesn’t 이동, but you can rotate it in all directions to
          view 범위 as desired. Unlike other 염탐 powers, this power does not allow psionically or supernaturally
          enhanced senses to work through it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the chosen locale is magically or psionically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you
          can see in a 10- foot radius around the center of the power’s effect or out to the extent of your natural
          암흑시야. The power does not work across 이세계.

          If you have a claw 공격(either from an actual natural weapon or from an effect such as
          <span style="font-style: italic">야수의 발톱</span>), you can use this power to energize that weapon. The claw
          공격 deals an extra 1d6 points of cold, electricity, or fire 피해(as chosen by you at the time of
          manifestation) on a successful hit. On a critical hit, it deals an extra 1d10 points of energy 피해. If the
          claw’s critical multiplier is x3, add 2d10 points of energy 피해 instead; if the multiplier is x4, add 3d10
          points of energy 피해.
        </p>
        <p>
          This power can be manifested on a claw 공격 that already deals energy 피해, but if the claw already deals the
          same type of 피해 as the power, the effects stack. If this power is manifested on a claw 공격 already
          benefiting from the effect of the power, the newer manifestation supersedes the older manifestation, even if
          both manifestations are of different energy types.
        </p>
        <p>This power’s subtype is the same as the type of energy infused in the natural weapon.</p>

        <p>
          You call forth the aggressive nature of the beast inherent in yourself, psionically transforming your hands
          into deadly claws. You gain two natural 공격 with your claws, each dealing 1d4 points of 피해(1d6 if you are
          Large, or 1d3 if you are Small) plus your 근력 보너스.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your claws are natural 무기, so you are considered armed when attacking with them, and they can be affected by
          powers, 주문, and effects that enhance or improve natural. You can choose to deal 비치명적인 피해 with your
          claws, taking the standard –4 페널티 on your 명중 굴림.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your claws work just like the natural 무기 of many 몬스터. You can make an 공격 with one claw or a 전력 공격
          with two claws at your normal 공격 보너스, replacing your normal 공격 routine. You take no 페널티 for 쌍수
          무기 전투술, and neither 공격 is a secondary 공격. If your 기본 공격 보너스 is +6 or higher, you do not gain
          any additional 공격—you simply have two claw 공격 at your normal 공격 보너스.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain the benefit of the power on your
          turn before you 공격. Manifesting this power is a swift action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it
          counts toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round. You cannot manifest this power when it isn’t
          your turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can call or dismiss the claws as a swift action during 지속시간 of the power. If you 공격 with a
          manufactured weapon or another natural 공격, you can’t make any claw 공격 in that round. You can still hold
          and manipulate items with your claws or cast 주문 just as well as you could with your hands.

          You do not 치료 피해 if your 공격 deals 비치명적인 피해, such as when you 공격 a creature that has 재생
          ability. Moreover, you gain no 치료 from attacking any creature that is under the effect of

          You make yourself completely undetectable to the subject by erasing all awareness of your presence from its
          mind. This power has the following effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, you are invisible and inaudible to the creature. It cannot even detect your presence by means of
          blindsense, blindsight, 냄새, or 열감지. It cannot pinpoint your location by any means.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the subject remains unaware of your actions, provided you do not make any 공격 or cause any obvious or
          directly threatening changes in the subject’s 환경. If you 공격 the subject creature, the effect ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you take an action that creates a sustained and obvious change in the subject’s 환경—for example, attacking
          a creature aside from the subject or moving a large or attended object the subject can see—the subject
          immediately gains a new 내성 굴림 against the power. An ally of the subject creature that is able to see or
          perceive you can use a 이동 action to warn the subject and thereby grant it a new 내성 굴림.

          This power causes instant diminution, halving your height, length, and width and dividing your weight by 8.
          This decrease changes your size category to the next smaller one. You gain a +2 size 보너스 to 민첩, a –2 size
          페널티 to 근력(to a minimum effective 근력 score of 1), a +1 size 보너스 on 명중 굴림, and a +1 size 보너스 to
          방어도 due to your reduced size. If your new size is Tiny, you have a space of 2 1/2 feet and a natural reach
          of 0 feet (meaning that you must enter an opponent’s square to 공격). If your new size is Diminutive, you have
          a space of 1 foot and a natural reach of 0 feet. This power doesn’t change your 속도.
        </p>
        <p>
          All your 장비, worn or carried, is similarly reduced by the power. Melee and projectile 무기 deal less 피해.
          Other psionic or magical properties are not affected by this power. Any affected item that leaves your
          possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that
          thrown 무기 deal their normal 피해(projectiles deal 피해 based on the size of the weapon that fired them).
          Multiple effects that reduce size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can’t use a second
          manifestation of this power to further reduce yourself.

        <p>
          You pyrokinetically control the intensity or 이동 of one fire source. A nonmagical fire source can be
          controlled if it is equal to or smaller than the maximum size of fire you can control according to your 구현자
          레벨, as noted on the accompanying table. You can freely switch control between fire sources, or change the
          nature of your control, while you maintain 집중, but only one specified change (keeping a fire burning,
          animating it, or altering its size) can be made to one fire source in a round. When your control over a fire
          source lapses, that fire immediately returns to its original state (or goes out if it has no fuel or has been
          moved away from its original location). With this power, you can artificially keep a fire burning that would
          normally expire for lack of fuel; even dousing a controlled flame with water does not put it out (though
          completely submerging the flame would). Normally, a creature at risk of 불 붙음 can avoid this fate by making
          a DC 15 Reflex 내성 굴림, with success indicating that the fire has gone out. If the fire is one that has been
          kept burning by the use of <span style="font-style: italic">화염 조종, </span>then the DC of the Reflex save
          needed to put out the flames increases to 25.
        </p>
        <p>
          This power also enables you to make a fire 이동 as if it were a living creature. You can animate only a
          naturally burning fire; if you attempt to animate one that has been increased or decreased in size by your
          augmentation of this power, the fire immediately returns to its original size. An animated fire 이동 at a 속도
          of 30 feet. A fire that 이동 away from its fuel or its original location dies as soon as your control over it
          lapses.
        </p>
        <p>
          An animated fire can enter any square, even if a creature already occupies it. If an animated fire enters a
          square occupied by a creature, that creature can make a Reflex save to get out of the way (DC 11 + the number
          of 주사위 of 피해 the fire does + your Int 수정치 if you are a 사이언 or your Cha 수정치 if you are a
          와일더). A successful Reflex save 이동 the creature to the nearest unoccupied square. The flames deal the
          indicated 피해 to any creature that is either on fire or surrounded by the flames (in the fire’s space); see
          the accompanying table).
        </p>
        <p>
          At the start of your turn, the animated fire deals 피해 to any creature in its space, and the creature catches
          on fire unless it makes a Reflex save (DC as noted above). A victim on fire takes 1d6 points of 피해 each
          round. Additional rounds in the same space as the animated fire occupies mean additional chances of ignition.
          피해 from multiple normal fires stacks, but the victim gets a 내성 굴림 each round to negate each fire. It
          is possible to switch control from the animated fire (causing it to disappear) to intensify f lames that are
          already burning (thus denying the foe Ref lex 내성 굴림 after the first).

          You telekinetically “bring to life” an inanimate object. Though it is not actually alive, the object 이동
          under your control. Live vegetation cannot be controlled in this fashion, nor can already 살아 움직이는 물체
          or undead. The controlled object 이동 like a puppet, with jerky and clumsy 이동, at a 속도 of up to 20 feet.

          You shape and alter existing sounds. You can target one sound, such as a person speaking or singing, or a
          group of related sounds, such as the patter of many raindrops or the tramp of soldiers passing by. A sound as
          quiet as a snapping finger can be controlled. You can substitute any sound you have heard for the target
          sound. If you attempt to exactly duplicate the voice of a specific individual, or an inherently terrifying
          sound (such as a 드래곤’s roar), you must succeed on a 허세 check with a +5 circumstance 보너스 opposed by the
          intended listener’s 의도 파악 check to avoid arousing suspicion.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can entirely muffle a noise or magnify a sound to such loudness that it drowns out all other conversation
          in the immediate 범위. In this way, you can provide yourself or any with a +4 circumstance 보너스 on 조용히
          이동 and 듣기 checks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, you can use up the power in an instant. You do this by modulating a sound into a one-time
          destructive impetus that 분쇄 nonmagical/nonpsionic, unattended objects of crystal, glass, ceramics, or
          porcelain (vials, bottles, flasks, jugs, mirrors, and so forth) in 범위.

          You forge a passive mental link with a creature with which you have previously had physical or mental contact.
          The subject need not be within sight or even on the same plane as you are. The subject recognizes you, and you
          can mentally communicate with it for 지속시간(though nothing forces the subject to respond to you),
          exchanging 통보 of twenty-five words or less once per round. Receiving a 통보 is not an action and does not
          provoke 기회 공격; however, 송신 a 통보 is equivalent to a standard action that can provoke 기회 공격.

          You create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what
          type of sound the power creates when manifesting it and cannot thereafter change its basic character. The
          volume of sound created, however, depends on your 레벨. You can produce as much noise as four normal 인간 per
          구현자 레벨(maximum twenty 인간). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can
          be created. The noise produced can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of 시궁쥐
          running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight 인간 running and shouting. A roaring 사자 is equal to
          the noise from sixteen 인간, while a roaring 흉폭한 사자 is equal to the noise from twenty 인간.

          You compel the subject to purge its entire store of air in one explosive exhalation, and thereby disrupt the
          subject’s autonomic breathing cycle. The subject’s lungs do not automatically function again while the power’s
          지속시간 lasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the target succeeds on a Will save when <span style="font-style: italic">위기의 숨결 </span>is manifested,
          it is unaffected by this power. If it fails its Will save, it can still continue to breathe by taking a
          standard action in each round to gasp for breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          An affected creature can attempt to take actions normally (instead of consciously controlling its breathing),
          but each round it does so, beginning in the round when it failed its Will save, the subject risks blacking out
          from lack of oxygen. It must succeed on a Fortitude save at the end of any of its turns in which it did not
          consciously take a breath. The DC of this save increases by 1 in every consecutive round after the first one
          that goes by without a breath; the DC drops back to its original value if the subject spends an action to take
          a breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a subject fails a Fortitude save, it is 행동 불능(0 hp). In the following round, it drops to –1 히트
          포인트 and is 죽어가고 있음. Curing powers or 주문 can revive a 죽어가고 있음 subject normally, so long as
          this power’s 지속시간 has expired; if the power is still in effect, a revived creature is still subject to
          Fortitude 내성 굴림 in each round when it does not consciously breathe.
