      <p>In addition to 마법 아이템 created with 주문, some substances have innate special properties.</p>
      <p>
        If you make a suit of 갑옷 or weapon out of more than one special material, you get the benefit of only the most
        prevalent material. However, you can build a 쌍날 무기 with each head made of a different special material.

        <p>
          Each of 특수 재료 described below has a definite game effect. Some creatures have 피해 축소 based on their
          creature type or core concept. Some are resistant to all but a special type of 피해, such as that dealt by
          evil-aligned 무기 or bludgeoning 무기. Others are vulnerable to 무기 of a particular material. Characters may
          choose to carry several different types of 무기, depending upon the campaign and types of creatures they most
          commonly encounter.

        <p>
          <b>Adamantine:</b><span>
            This ultrahard metal adds to the quality of a weapon or suit of 갑옷. 무기 fashioned from adamantine have a
            natural ability to 바이패스 hardness when sundering 무기 or attacking objects, ignoring hardness less than
            20. 갑옷 made from adamantine grants its wearer 피해 축소 of 1/– if it의 경량 갑옷, 2/– if it의 medium 갑옷,
            and 3/– if it의 heavy 갑옷. Adamantine is so costly that 무기 and 갑옷 made from it are always of 명품
            quality; the 명품 cost is included in the prices given below. Thus, adamantine 무기 and ammunition
            have a +1 enhancement 보너스 on 명중 굴림, and 갑옷 판정 페널티 of adamantine 갑옷 is lessened by 1
            compared to ordinary 갑옷 of its type. Items without metal parts cannot be made from adamantine. An arrow
            could be made of adamantine, but a quarterstaff could not.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Only 무기, 갑옷, and 방패 normally made of metal can be fashioned from adamantine. 무기, 갑옷 및 방패 normally
          made of steel that are made of adamantine have one-third more 히트 포인트 than normal. Adamantine has 40 히트
          포인트 per inch of thickness and hardness 20.

        <p>
          <b>Darkwood:</b><span>
            This rare magic wood is as hard as normal wood but very 빛. Any wooden or mostly wooden item (such as a bow,
            an arrow, or a spear) made from darkwood is considered a 명품 item and weighs only half as much as a
            normal wooden item of that type. Items not normally made of wood or only partially of wood (such as a
            battleaxe or a mace) either cannot be made from darkwood or do not gain any special benefit from being made
            of darkwood. 갑옷 판정 페널티 of a darkwood 방패 is lessened by 2 compared to an ordinary 방패 of its type.
            To determine the price of a darkwood item, use the original weight but add 10 gp per pound to the price of a
            명품 version of that item.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Darkwood has 10 히트 포인트 per inch of thickness and hardness 5.</p>
        <p>
          <b>드래곤둥지:</b><span>
            Armorsmiths can work with 숨기 of 드래곤 to produce 갑옷 or 방패 of 명품 quality. One 드래곤 produces
            enough 숨기 for a single suit of 명품 숨기 갑옷 for a creature one size category smaller than 드래곤.
            By selecting only choice scales and bits of 숨기, an armorsmith can produce one suit of 명품 banded
            mail for a creature two sizes smaller, one suit of 명품 half-plate for a creature three sizes smaller,
            or one 명품 breastplate or suit of full plate for a creature four sizes smaller. In each case, enough
            숨기 is available to produce a small or large 명품 방패 in addition to 갑옷, provided that 드래곤 is
            Large or larger.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Because 드래곤둥지 갑옷 isn’t made of metal, 드루이드 can wear it without 페널티.</p>
        <p>
          드래곤둥지 갑옷 costs double what 명품 갑옷 of that type ordinarily costs, but it takes no longer to make than
          ordinary 갑옷 of that type.
        </p>
        <p>드래곤둥지 has 10 히트 포인트 per inch of thickness and hardness 10.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Iron, Cold:</b><span>
            This iron, mined deep underground, known for its effectiveness against fey creatures, is forged at a lower
            temperature to preserve its delicate properties. 무기 made of cold iron cost twice as much to make as their
            normal counterparts. Also, any magical enhancements cost an additional 2,000 gp.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Items without metal parts cannot be made from cold iron. An arrow could be made of cold iron, but a
          quarterstaff could not.
        </p>
        <p>A 쌍날 무기 that has only half of it made of cold iron increases its cost by 50%.</p>
        <p>Cold iron has 30 히트 포인트 per inch of thickness and hardness 10.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Mithral:</b><span>
            Mithral is a very rare silvery, glistening metal that is lighter than iron but just as hard. When worked
            like steel, it becomes a wonderful material from which to create 갑옷 and is occasionally used for other
            items as well. Most mithral 갑옷 are one category lighter than normal for 목적 of 이동 and other
            limitations. Heavy 갑옷 are treated as medium, and medium 갑옷 are treated as 빛, but 경량 갑옷 are still
            treated as 빛. 주문 실패 chances for 갑옷 and 방패 made from mithral are decreased by 10%, maximum 민첩
            보너스 is increased by 2, and 갑옷 판정 페널티 are lessened by 3 (to a minimum of 0).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          An item made from mithral weighs half as much as the same item made from other metals. In the case of 무기,
          this lighter weight does not change a weapon의 size category or the ease with which it can be wielded (whether
          it is 빛, one-handed, or two-handed). Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being
          partially made of mithral. (A longsword can be a mithral weapon, while a scythe cannot be.)
        </p>
        <p>
          무기 or 갑옷 fashioned from mithral are always 명품 아이템 as well; the 명품 cost is included in the
          prices given below.
        </p>
        <p>Mithral has 30 히트 포인트 per inch of thickness and hardness 15.</p>

          <b>Silver, Alchemical:</b><span>
            A complex process involving metallurgy and alchemy can bond silver to a weapon made of steel so that it
            바이패스 피해 축소 of creatures such as 라이칸스로프.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          On a successful 공격 with a silvered weapon, the wielder takes a –1 페널티 on 피해 roll (with the usual
          minimum of 1 point of 피해). The alchemical silvering process can’t be applied to nonmetal items, and it
          doesn’t work on rare metals such as adamantine, cold iron, and mithral.
        </p>
        <p>Alchemical silver has 10 히트 포인트 per inch of thickness and hardness 8.</p>
