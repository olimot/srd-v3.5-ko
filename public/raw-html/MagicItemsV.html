          <b>특성:</b><span>
            Roll d%. An 01 result indicates the wondrous item is intelligent, 02–31 indicates that something (a design,
            inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32–100 indicates no 특성. 지능있는 아이템
            have extra 능력 and sometimes extraordinary powers and special 목적.</span>

          <b>아뮬렛 of 이세계:</b><span>
            This device usually appears to be a black circular 아뮬렛, although any character looking closely at it sees
            a dark, moving swirl of color. 아뮬렛 allows its wearer to utilize
            <i>이세계 전이</i>. However, this is a difficult item to master. The user
            must make a DC 15 지능 check in order to get 아뮬렛 to take her to the plane (and the specific location on
            that plane) that she wants. If she fails, 아뮬렛 운송수단 her and all those traveling with her to a random

            wearer, the caster of 점술 must succeed on a 시전자 레벨 check (1d20 + 시전자 레벨) against a DC of 19 (as
            if the caster had cast <i>탐지방어 </i>on herself ).</span>

            opens a hatch in one end. Anyone who crawls inside finds ten (unlabeled) levers: The device has the

          Operating a lever is a full-round action, and no lever may be operated more than once per round. However,
          since two Medium characters can fit inside, the apparatus can 이동 and 공격 in the same round. The device can
          function in water up to 900 feet deep. It holds enough air for a crew of two to survive 1d4+1 hours (twice as
          long for a single occupant). When activated, the apparatus looks something like a 거인 lobster.

          <b>Bag of Holding:</b><span>
            This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The
            <i>bag of holding </i>opens into a nondimensional space: Its inside is
            larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs a fixed amount. This
            weight, and the limits in weight and volume of the bag의 contents, depend on the bag의 type, as shown on the

          If the bag is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag ruptures and is
          ruined. All contents are lost forever. If a <i>bag of holding </i>is turned
          inside out, its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If
          living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they
          suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a <i>bag of holding </i>is a 이동
          action—unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific
          item is a full-round action.

        <p>
          If a <i>bag of holding </i>is placed within a
          <i>portable hole</i> a rift to 영적 세계 is torn in the space: Bag and hole
          alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a <i>portable hole </i>is
          placed within a <i>bag of holding, </i>it opens a 관문 to 영적 세계: The
          hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the
          <i>portable hole </i>and
          <i>bag of holding </i>in the process.

          <b>Bag of Tricks: </b><span>This small sack appears normal and empty. However, anyone reaching into the bag feels a small, fuzzy ball.
            If the ball is removed and tossed up to 20 feet away, it turns into an animal. The animal serves the
            character who drew it from the bag for 10 minutes (or until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which
            point it disappears. It can follow any of 명령 described in 동물 조련 skill. Each of the three kinds of a
            <i>bag of tricks </i>produces a different set of animals. Use the following
            tables to determine what animals can be drawn out of each.</span>

          The heavy warhorse appears with harness and tack and accepts the character who drew it from the bag as a
          rider.
        </p>
        <p>
          Animals produced are always random, and only one may exist at a time. Up to ten animals can be drawn from the
          bag each week.

          <b>Bead of Force:</b><span>
            This small black sphere appears to be a lusterless pearl. You can throw it up to 60 feet with no 거리
            페널티. Upon sharp impact, the bead explodes, 송신 forth a 폭발 that deals 5d6 points of force 피해 to all
            creatures within a 10-foot radius.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          It functions like a<i> 탄성의 구 </i>spell (Reflex DC 16 negates) with a
          radius of 10 feet and a 지속시간 of 10 minutes. A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the
          latter is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the
          spell의 지속시간. The sphere is not subject to 피해 of any sort except from a
          <i>rod of cancellation, </i>a
          <i>rod of negation, 분해, </i>or a targeted
          <i>마법 무효화 </i>spell. These effects destroy the sphere without 해악 to
          the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The
          subject may struggle, but the globe cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles
          of those within.
        </p>
        <p>The explosion completely consumes the bead, making this a one-use item.</p>

            A folding boat looks like a small wooden box—about 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It can

            a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second 명령 word causes it to unfold to a ship 24
            feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or
            ship.</span>

          In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. In its larger form,

          <b>Candle of Invocation: </b><span>Each of these special tapers is dedicated to one of 아홉 종류의 성향. Simply burning the candle generates a
            favorable aura for the individual so doing if the candle의 성향 matches that of the character. Characters of
            the same 성향 as the burning candle add a +2 의욕 보너스 on 명중 굴림, 내성 굴림, and 스킬 판정 while within
            30 feet of the flame.</span>

          A 사제 whose 성향 matches the candle의 operates as if two 레벨 higher for 목적 of determining 주문 per day if
          he burns the candle during or just prior to his spell preparation time. He can even cast 주문 normally
          unavailable to him, as if he were of that higher 레벨, but only so long as the candle continues to burn.
          Except in special cases (see below), a candle burns for 4 hours.

        <p>
          In addition, burning a candle also allows the owner to cast a
          <i>관문 </i>spell, the respondent being of the same 성향 as the candle, but
          the taper is immediately consumed in the process. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply by blowing it
          out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect it from drafts and the like. Doing this doesn’t interfere
          with its magical properties.

            A <i>chime of opening </i>is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When
            struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, 문, valves, and portals to open. The
            device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, 화살복제, and so on. A
            <i>chime of opening </i>also automatically dispels a

        <p>
          The chime must be pointed at the item or 관문 to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the
          user). The chime is then struck, a clear tone 반지 forth, and in 1 round the target lock is unlocked, the
          shackle is loosed, the secret door is opened, or the lid of the chest is lifted. Each sounding only opens one
          form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and
          <i>arcane locked, </i>it takes four uses of a
          <i>chime of opening </i>to get it open. A

          <b>Cube of Frost 저항:</b><span>
            This cube is activated or deactivated by pressing one side. When activated, it creates a cube-shaped 범위 10
            feet on a side centered on the possessor (or on the cube itself, if the item is later placed on a
            surface)<i>. </i>The temperature within this 범위 is always at least 65°F.
            The field absorbs all cold-based 공격. However, if the field is subjected to more than 50 points of cold
            피해 in 1 round (from one or multiple 공격), it collapses into its portable form and cannot be reactivated
            for 1 hour. If the field absorbs more than 100 points of cold 피해 in a 10-round period, the cube is
            destroyed.</span>

          <b>Cubic 관문: </b><span>This item is fashioned from carnelian. Each of the six sides of the cube is keyed to a plane, one of which
            is 물질 세계. The character creating the item should choose 이세계 to which the other five sides are
            keyed.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          If a side of the <i>cubic 관문 </i>is pressed once, it opens a
          <i>관문 </i>to a random point on the plane keyed to that side. There is a 10%
          chance per minute that an outsider from that plane (determine randomly) comes through it looking for food,
          fun, or trouble. Pressing the side a second time closes the <i>관문</i>. It
          is impossible to open more than one <i>관문 </i>at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a side is pressed twice in quick succession, the character so doing is transported to a random point on the
          other plane, along with all creatures in adjacent squares. (The other creatures may avoid this fate by
          succeeding on DC 23 Will 내성 굴림).

        <p>
          The geyser effect causes considerable back pressure, requiring the holder to make a DC 12 근력 check to avoid

          <b>Deck of 환영술:</b><span>
            This set of parchment cards is usually found in an ivory, leather, or wooden box. A full deck consists of
            thirty-four cards. When a card is drawn at random and thrown to the ground, a
            <i>상급 환영 </i>of a creature is formed. The figment lasts until
            dispelled. The illusory creature cannot 이동 more than 30 feet away from where the card landed, but
            otherwise 이동 and acts as if it were real. At all times it obeys the desires of the character who drew the
            card. When 환영술 is dispelled, the card becomes blank and cannot be used again. If the card is picked up,
            환영술 is automatically and instantly dispelled. The cards in a deck and 환영술 they bring forth are
            summarized on the following table. (Use one of the first two columns to simulate the contents of a full deck

            This fine powder appears to be a very fine, very 빛 metallic dust. A single handful of this substance flung
            into the air coats objects within a 10-foot radius, making them visible even if they are invisible. It
            likewise negates the effects of <i>흐릿함 </i>and

          <b>Dust of Disappearance:</b><span>
            This dust looks just like <i>dust of appearance </i>and is typically stored
            in the same manner. A creature or object touched by it becomes invisible (as
            <i>상급 투명화</i>). Normal 시야 can’t see dusted creatures or objects, nor
            can they be detected by magical means, including <i>투명상태 보기 </i>or

          <b>Dust of Dryness:</b><span>
            This special dust has many uses. If it is thrown into water, a volume of as much as 100 gallons is instantly
            transformed to nothingness, and the dust becomes a marble-sized pellet, floating or resting where it was
            thrown. If this pellet is hurled down, it breaks and releases the same volume of water. The dust affects
            only water (fresh, salt, alkaline), not other liquids.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          If the dust is employed against an 정령 with the water subtype, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save
          or be destroyed. The dust deals 5d6 points of 피해 to the creature even if its 내성 굴림 succeeds.

            creature is affected as if by a <i>변장 </i>glamer, with the individual who
            sprinkles the dust envisioning 환영술 desired. An unwilling target is allowed a DC 11 Reflex save to avoid
            the dust. The glamer lasts for 2 hours.</span>

          <b>Dust of Tracelessness:</b><span>
            This normal-외관변경 dust is actually a magic powder that can conceal the passage of its possessor and his
            companions. Tossing a handful of this dust into the air causes a chamber of up to 100 square feet of floor
            space to become as dusty, dirty, and cobweb-laden as if it had been abandoned and disused for a
            decade.</span>

          A handful of dust sprinkled along a trail causes evidence of the passage of as many as a dozen men and 말 to

          aura lingers afterward from this use of the dust. 생존 checks made to 추적 a quarry across an 범위 affected by
          this dust have a DC 20 higher than normal.

          <b>Efficient Quiver:</b><span>
            This appears to be a typical arrow container capable of holding about twenty arrows. It has three distinct
            portions, each with a nondimensional space allowing it to store far more than would normally be possible.
            The first and smallest one can contain up to sixty objects of the same general size and shape as an arrow.
            The second slightly longer compartment holds up to eighteen objects of the same general size and shape as a
            javelin. The third and longest portion of the case contains as many as six objects of the same general size
            and shape as a bow (spears, 마법지팡이, or the like). Once the owner has filled it, the quiver can produce
            any item she 소원, as if from a regular quiver or scabbard. The

            stream of smoke is often seen issuing from it. The bottle can be opened once per day. When opened, the
            이프리티 imprisoned within issues from the bottle instantly. There is a 10% chance (01–10 on d%) that the
            이프리티 is insane and 공격 immediately upon being released. There is also a 10% chance (91–100) that the
            이프리티 of the bottle grants three <i>소원</i>. In either case, the
            이프리티 afterward disappears forever. The other 80% of the time (11–90), the inhabitant of the bottle

            of smoke is great if the stopper is pulled out, pouring from the bottle and totally obscuring 시야 across a

          탈것 equal to that of a heavy 말 in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of one
          day each week—continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when 명령
          word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for not less than one day before it can again be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          • <i>The Goat of Travail: </i>This statuette becomes an enormous creature,
          larger than a bull, with the statistics of a 밤마귀 except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of
          exceptional size (피해 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to 공격, it may only use its horns (but add 6
          points of 피해 to each successful 공격 in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to

        <p>
          • <i>The Goat of Terror: </i>When called upon with the proper 명령 word, this
          statuette becomes a destrier-like 탈것, with the statistics of a 가벼운 전투마. However, its rider can
          employ the goat의 horns as 무기(one horn as a <i>+3 heavy lance, </i>the
          other as a <i>+5 longsword</i>). When ridden in an 공격 against an opponent,

            <i>에테리얼 기행. </i>The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the

          beam is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a DC 14 Fortitude save. This use of the gem expends 1 돌격.
        </p>
        <p>
          • The third 명령 word causes the gem to 섬광 in a blinding flash of 빛 that fills a 30-foot cone. Although

          <b>Handy Haversack:</b><span>
            A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It is constructed of finely
            tanned leather, and the straps have brass hardware and buckles. It has two side pouches, each of which
            appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a
            <i>bag of holding </i>and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic
            feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet
            or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even 상급 power in addition. When the wearer reaches into
          it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to
          find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a 이동 action, but it does
          not provoke 기회 공격 that retrieving a stored item usually does.

            ten diamonds, twenty rubies, thirty fire opals, and forty opals. When struck by bright 빛, the helm
            scintillates and sends forth reflective 광선 in all directions from its crownlike, gem-tipped spikes. The
            jewels’ functions are as follows:</span>
        </p>
        <p>• Diamond: <i>무지갯빛 분사 </i>(save DC 20)</p>
        <p>• Ruby: <i>불의 장벽</i></p>
        <p>• Fire opal: <i>화염구 </i>(10d6, Reflex DC 20 half )</p>
        <p>• Opal: <i>햇살</i></p>
        <p>
          The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can 공연 its 유사주문 power just once. Until all its
          jewels are depleted, a <i>helm of brilliance </i>also has the following
          magical properties when activated.
        </p>
        <p>
          • It emanates a bluish 빛 when undead are within 30 feet. This 빛 causes 1d6 points of 피해 per round to all
          such creatures within that 거리.
        </p>
        <p>
          • The wearer may 명령 any weapon he wields to become a flaming weapon. This is in addition to whatever 능력
          the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). 명령 takes 1 round to take
          effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          • The helm provides 저항 to fire 30. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other
          sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its powers and the gems turn to worthless powder.
          Removing a jewel destroys it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account)
          and fails an additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining
          diamonds become <i>무지갯빛 분사 </i>that each randomly target a creature
          within 거리(possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line
          <i>벽 of fire </i>extending outward in a random direction from the helm
          wearer, and fire opals become <i>화염구 </i>centered on the helm wearer. The
          opals and the helm itself are destroyed.

          When the proper 명령 word is spoken and the spherical iron device is hurled at an opponent, the bands expand

            These special containers are typically inlaid with 달리기 of silver and stoppered by a brass plug bearing a

          the user, unless it perceives a good reason not to.) Any attempt to force the same creature into the flask a

            These magic emulsions enable their possessor to create actual, permanent objects simply by depicting their
            form in two dimensions. The pigments are applied by a stick tipped with bristles, hair, or fur. The emulsion
            flows from the application to form the desired object as the artist concentrates on the desired image. One
            pot of <i>marvelous pigments </i>is sufficient to create a 1,000-cubic-foot
            object by depicting it two-dimensionally over a 100-square-foot surface.

        </p>
        <p>
          Only normal, inanimate objects can be created. Creatures can’t be created. The pigments must be applied to a

          <i>Marvelous pigments </i>cannot create 마법 아이템. Objects of value
          depicted by the pigments —precious metals, gems, jewelry, ivory, and so on— appear to be valuable but are

          <b>Mirror of Life Trapping:</b><span>
            This crystal device is usually about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. It can be hung or placed on
            a surface and then activated by giving a 명령 word. The same 명령 word deactivates the mirror. A
            <i>mirror of life trapping </i>has fifteen nonspatial extradimensional
            compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection
            must make a DC 23 Will save or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the
            nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection,
            and thus needing to make 내성 굴림, drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror 함정 life and
            seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze 공격).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and
          undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim의 장비(including 의류
          and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror의 owner knows the right 명령 word, he can call the
          reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation.
          Another 명령 word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of 명령 words is specific to each prisoner.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the mirror의 capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the
          latest one. If the mirror is broken, all victims currently trapped in it are freed.

          <b>Mirror of Mental 기량:</b><span>
            This mirror resembles an ordinary looking glass 5 feet tall by 2 feet wide. The possessor who knows the
            proper 명령 can cause it to 공연 as follows.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          • Read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, as long as the owner is within 25 feet of the mirror,
          even if those thoughts are in an unknown language.
        </p>
        <p>
          • View other places as if with <i>clairvoyance, </i>but 시야 extends even
          onto other 이세계 if the viewer is sufficiently familiar with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Use it as a portal to visit other places. The user first views the place with the
          <i>clairvoyance </i>function, then steps through the mirror to the place
          pictured. Others can follow her through the mirror if they like. An invisible portal remains on the other side
          where she arrives, and she can return through that portal. Once she returns, the portal closes. The portal
          closes on its own after 24 hours (trapping the user if she의 still in the other place), and the user can also
          close it with a 명령 word. Creatures with 지능 of 12 or higher might notice the portal just as they might
          notice a magical sensor from a <i>염탐 </i>spell. Any creature who steps
          through the portal appears in front of the mirror.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Once per week the mirror accurately answers one short question regarding a creature whose image is shown on
          its surface (giving answers similar to those from the
          <i>전설의 지식 </i>spell).

            This device appears to be nothing but beads on a string, sometimes with the ends tied together to form a
            necklace. (It does not count as an item worn around the neck for 목적 of determining which of a character의

            golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only
            by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its
            trajectory, it detonates as a <i>화염구 </i>spell (Reflex DC 14 half )<i>.</i></span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Spheres come in different 근력, ranging from those that deal 2d6 points of fire 피해 to those that deal 10d6.
          시장 가격 of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of 피해 it deals.

          shaken (except when she is in a totally silent 범위). This hypersensitivity is a curse and therefore hard to
          remove (see the <i>저주 부여 </i>spell).

            These wooden pipes appear ordinary, but if the possessor learns the proper tune, he can attract 1d3 시궁쥐
            떼 if 시궁쥐 are within 400 feet. For each 50-foot distance 시궁쥐 have to travel, there is a 1-round 지연.
            The piper must continue playing until 시궁쥐 appear, and when they do so, the piper must make a DC 10
            공연(wind instruments) check. Success means that they obey the piper의 telepathic 명령 so long as he
            continues to play. Failure indicates that they turn on the piper. If for any reason the piper ceases
            playing, 시궁쥐 leave immediately. If they are called again within a day, 공연 check DC is 15.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          If 시궁쥐 are under the control of another creature, add the HD of the controller to 공연 check DC. Once
          control is assumed, another check is required each round to maintain it if the other creature is actively
          seeking to reassert its control.

          <b>Portable Hole:</b><span>
            A portable hole is a circle of cloth spun from 거미줄 of a 위상 거미 interwoven with strands of ether and
            beams of starlight. When opened fully, a portable hole is 6 feet in diameter, but it can be folded up to be
            as small as a pocket handkerchief. When spread upon any surface, it causes an extradimensional space 10 feet
            deep to come into being. This hole can be picked up from inside or out by simply taking hold of the edges of
            the cloth and folding it up. Either way, the entrance disappears, but anything inside the hole
            remains.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The only air in the hole is that which enters when the hole is opened. It contains enough air to supply one
          Medium creature or two Small creatures for 10 minutes. The cloth does not accumulate weight even if its hole
          is filled. Each <i>portable hole </i>opens on its own particular
          nondimensional space. If a <i>bag of holding </i>is placed within a
          <i>portable hole</i>, a rift to 영적 세계 is torn in that place. Both the bag
          and the cloth are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a
          <i>portable hole </i>is placed within a
          <i>bag of holding, </i>it opens a 관문 to 영적 세계. The hole, the bag, and
          any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, the
          <i>portable hole </i>and
          <i>bag of holding </i>being destroyed in the process.

          <b>Tome of Understanding:</b><span>
            This thick book contains tips for improving instinct and perception, but entwined within the words is a
            powerful magical effect. If anyone reads this book, which takes a total of 48 hours over a minimum of six

          <b>Unguent of Timelessness:</b><span>
            When applied to any matter that was once alive this ointment allows that substance to resist the passage of
            time. Each year of actual time affects the substance as if only a day had passed. The coated object gains a
            +1 저항 보너스 on all 내성 굴림. The unguent never wears off, although it can be magically removed (by
            dispelling the effect, for instance). One flask contains enough material to coat eight Medium or smaller
            objects. A Large object counts as two Medium objects, and a Huge object counts as two Large objects.</span>

          <b>Well of Many Worlds:</b><span>
            This strange, interdimensional device looks just like a
            <i>portable hole. </i>Anything placed within it is immediately cast to
            another world—a parallel world, another planet, or a different plane (chosen randomly). If the well is
            moved, the random factor again comes into play. It can be picked up, folded, or rolled, just as a
            <i>portable hole </i>can be. Objects from the world the well touches can
            come through the opening just as easily as from the initiating place. (It is a two-way portal.)</span>

          <b>Wind Fan:</b><span>
            A <i>wind fan </i>appears to be nothing more than a wood and papyrus or
            cloth instrument with which to create a cooling breeze. By uttering 명령 word, its possessor causes the fan
            to generate air 이동 duplicating a <i>돌풍 </i>spell. The fan can be used
            once per day with no risk. If it is used more frequently, there is a 20% cumulative chance per usage during
            that day that the device tears into useless, nonmagical tatters.</span>

            A pair of these wings might appear to be nothing more than a plain cloak of old, black cloth, or they could
            be as elegant as a long cape of 파랑이 feathers. When the wearer 말하기 명령 word, the cloak turns into a
            pair of 박쥐 or bird wings that empower her to 비행 with a 속도 of 60 feet (good maneuverability).</span>
