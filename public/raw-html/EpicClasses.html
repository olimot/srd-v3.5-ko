        Epic level psionic characters follow the same epic progression as non-psionics epic characters, except as noted
        below.
      </p>
      <p>
        • For manifesters, manifester level continues to increase after 20th level. However, a manifester’s power points
        and powers known at each level do not increase automatically after 20th level.
      </p>
      <p>
        • The powers of psicrystals that are based on the creator’s level continue to increase as their owner gains
        levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        • Bonus feats for epic psionic classes can be chosen from among any epic feats for which the character meets the
        prerequisites or any psionic, metapsionic, or psionic item creation feat, as normal.

        <p>
          Epic psionic characters do not gain additional bonus power points above 20th. They may still gain more power
          points as their key ability score increases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Psionic characters can take the Improved Manifestation feat, which grants them additional power points each
          time they take the feat. Epic manifesters can also take Epic Expanded Knowledge or Power Knowledge, which give
          them access to additional powers, and Epic Psionic Focus, which allows manifesters to use more than one
          metapsionic power each time they expend their psionic focus.
