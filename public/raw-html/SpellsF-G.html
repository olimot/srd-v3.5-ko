          not benefit from 은폐 normally provided by 암흑(though a 2nd-레벨 or higher magical
          <i>암흑 </i>effect functions normally),
          <i>흐릿함</i>, 변위, 투명화, or similar effects. 빛 is too dim to have any

          An invisible cone of terror causes each living creature in 범위 to become panicked unless it succeeds on a

        <p>
          The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. <i>깃털 낙하 </i>instantly
          changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a
          few feet), and the subjects take no 피해 upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell
          지속시간 expires, a normal rate of 낙하 resumes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each
          creature의 maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts
          as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so
          forth.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall.
          Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of
          one quickened spell per round. You may even cast this spell when it isn’t your turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          This spell has no special effect on ranged 무기 unless they are 낙하 quite a distance. If the spell is cast on
          a 낙하 item the object does half normal 피해 based on its weight, with no 보너스 for the height of the drop.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>깃털 낙하 </i><span>works only upon free-물체 낙하. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.</span>

          If the target creature fails a Will 내성 굴림, its 지능 and 매력 scores each drop to 1. The affected creature
          is unable to use 지능- or 매력-based 스킬, cast 주문, understand language, or communicate coherently. Still,
          it knows who its friends are and can follow them and even protect them. The subject remains in this state
          until a <i>치유</i>, <i>제한된 소원</i>,
          <i>기적</i>, or <i>소원 </i>spell is used to
          cancel the effect of the <i>정신박약</i>. A creature that can cast 비전 주문,

          The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination, be
          it the way into or out of a locale. The locale can be outdoors, underground, or even inside a
          <i>미로 </i>spell. <i>길 찾기 </i>works with

          The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination,
          indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell
          enables the subject to sense 넘어뜨리기 wires or the proper word to 바이패스 a
          <i>수호의 문양. </i>The spell ends when the destination is reached or the
          지속시간 expires, whichever comes first. <i>길 찾기 </i>can be used to remove
          the subject and its companions from the effect of a <i>미로 </i>spell in a
          single round.

          A <i>화염구 </i>spell is an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar
          and deals 1d6 points of fire 피해 per 시전자 레벨(maximum 10d6) to every creature within 범위. Unattended
          objects also take this 피해. The explosion creates almost no pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          You point your finger and determine 거리(distance and height) at which the
          <i>화염구 </i>is to 폭발. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing
          digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed 거리,
          blossoms into the <i>화염구 </i>at that point. (An early impact results in an
          early detonation.) If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit,
          you must “hit” the opening with a ranged touch 공격, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates
          prematurely.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <i>화염구 </i>sets fire to combustibles and 피해 objects in 범위. It can
          melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If 피해 caused to an
          interposing barrier 분쇄 or breaks through it, the <i>화염구 </i>may continue
          beyond the barrier if 범위 permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

          or solid 벽 of force (your choice).

        <p>
          Creatures within 범위 are caught and contained unless they are too big to fit inside, in which case the spell
          automatically fails. Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide a means of escape, but the force
          벽 or bars extend into 에테리얼 세계, blocking ethereal travel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like a <i>힘의 장벽 </i>spell, a

            are confined. You can’t 공격 a creature in a barred cage with a weapon unless the weapon can fit between the

          Treat this 공격 as a 황소 쇄도 with a +14 보너스 on 근력 check (+8 for 근력 27, +4 for being Large, and a +2
          보너스 for charging, which it always gets). The hand always 이동 with the opponent to push that target back
          the full distance allowed, and it has no 속도 limit. Directing the spell to a new target is a 이동 action.

        <p>
          A very strong creature could not push the hand out of its way because the latter would instantly reposition

          This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself or another. Once
          <i>예언 </i>is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger
          or 해악 to the subject of the spell. You are never surprised or flat-footed. In addition, the spell gives you
          a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself and gives you a +2 insight 보너스 to AC
          and Reflex 내성 굴림. This insight 보너스 is lost whenever you would lose a 민첩 보너스 to AC.
        </p>
        <p>
          When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature. You must
          communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught
          unprepared in the absence of such a warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even
          telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the
          subject, provided you act on the warning without 지연. The subject, however, does not gain the insight 보너스
          to AC and Reflex 내성 굴림.

          liquid. It also can’t manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its 기체 형태.
          Continuously active items remain active, though in some cases their effects may be moot.

          Casting a <i>관문 </i>spell has two effects. First, it creates an
          interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between
          those two 이세계 in either direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the
          <i>관문.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The <i>관문 </i>itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in
          diameter (caster의 choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically
          vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the
          spell, and anyone or anything that 이동 through is shunted instantly to the other side.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <i>관문 </i>has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the
          <i>관문 </i>from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures
          moving through it from the back are not.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Planar Travel: </i><span>As a mode of planar travel, a <i>관문 </i>spell functions much like a
            <i>이세계 전이 </i>spell, except that the
            <i>관문 </i>opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect).
            Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a
            <i>관문 </i>from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so
            desire. Travelers need not join hands with you—anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported.
            A <i>관문 </i>cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the
            spell works only for interplanar travel.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          You may hold the <i>관문 </i>open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round
          per 시전자 레벨), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Calling Creatures: </i><span>The second effect of the <i>관문 </i>spell is to call an extraplanar
            creature to your 보조(a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the
            spell, you cause the <i>관문 </i>to open in the immediate vicinity of the
            desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no
            충동 to come through the <i>관문, </i>although they may choose to do so of
            their own accord. This use of the spell creates a <i>관문 </i>that remains
            open just long enough to 운송수단 the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see
            below).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual you may call either a single creature
          (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does
          not exceed your 시전자 레벨. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed
          twice your 시전자 레벨. A single creature with more HD than twice your 시전자 레벨 can’t be controlled.
          Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making
          the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          A controlled creature can be commanded to 공연 a service for you. Such services fall into two categories:
          immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that
          can be accomplished within 1 round per 시전자 레벨 counts as an immediate task; you need not make any
          agreement or pay any reward for the creature의 help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some
          fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised
          favor or reward; see the <i>하급 이세계 동료 소환 </i>spell for appropriate
          rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in “livestock” rather than in coin, which could involve
          complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you
          must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to
          return to its own plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by
          its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may 공격 you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Note: </i><span>When you use a calling spell such as <i>관문 </i>to call an air, chaotic,
            earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.</span>

          This spell functions similarly to <i>하급 geas, </i>except that it affects a
          creature of any HD and allows no 내성 굴림.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of taking 페널티 to 능력 점수(as with <i>하급 geas</i>), the subject
          takes 3d6 points of 피해 each day it does not attempt to follow the
          <i>기아스/임무</i>. Additionally, each day it must make a Fortitude 내성 굴림
          or become sickened. These effects end 24 hours after the creature attempts to resume the
          <i>geas/ quest</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <i>저주 제거 </i>spell ends a
          <i>기아스/임무 </i>spell only if its 시전자 레벨 is at least two higher than
          your 시전자 레벨. <i>부여술 파괴 </i>does not end a
          <i>기아스/임무</i>, but <i>제한된 소원</i>,
          <i>기적</i>, and <i>소원 </i>do.

        <p>
          음유시인, 소서러, and 마법사 usually refer to this spell as

          A <i>하급 geas </i>places a magical 명령 on a creature to carry out some
          service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or
          fewer 히트 다이스 and be able to understand you. While a <i>geas </i>cannot
          compel a creature to kill itself or 공연 acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any
          other course of activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <i>geased </i>creature must follow the given instructions until the
          <i>geas </i>is completed, no matter how long it takes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions
          the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per 시전자 레벨. A clever recipient can subvert some
          instructions:
        </p>
        <p>
          If the subject is prevented from obeying the <i>하급 geas </i>for 24 hours,
          it takes a –2 페널티 to each of its 능력 점수. Each day, another –2 페널티 accumulates, up to a total of –8.
          No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score 페널티 are removed 24 hours
          after the subject resumes obeying the <i>하급 geas.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          A <i>하급 geas </i>(and all ability score 페널티) can be ended by

          <i>저주 제거</i>, <i>기적</i>, or

          You preserve the remains of a 죽음 creature so that they do not decay. Doing so effectively extends the time
          limit on raising that creature from 죽음(see <i>시체 되살리기</i>). Days
          spent under the influence of this spell don’t count against the time limit. Additionally, this spell makes

          <i>유령의 소리 </i><span>allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You

        <p>
          The volume of sound created depends on your 레벨. You can produce as much noise as four normal 인간 per 시전자

          created. The noise a <i>유령의 소리 </i>spell produces can be virtually any
          type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of 시궁쥐 running and squeaking is about the same volume as
          eight 인간 running and shouting. A roaring 사자 is equal to the noise from sixteen 인간, while a roaring
          흉폭한 호랑이 is equal to the noise from twenty 인간.

          You turn three normal-sized centipedes, two normal-sized spiders, or a single normal-sized scorpion into

          of the effect must succeed on a 시전자 레벨 check (1d20 + 시전자 레벨) against a DC of 15 + your 시전자 레벨
          to succeed. Failure means the effect does not detect your lies or force you to 말하기 only the truth.

          This powerful inscription 해악 those who enter, pass, or open the warded 범위 or object. A
          <i>수호의 문양 </i>can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest
          or box, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          You set 상태이상 of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded 범위 or opening the warded object
          without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores.
          Alternatively or in addition to a password 트리거, <i>glyphs </i>can be set
          according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind.
          <i>Glyphs </i>can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or
          to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, 히트 다이스, or 레벨.
          <i>Glyphs </i>respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered
          by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple <i>glyphs </i>cannot be
          cast on the same 범위. However, if a cabinet has three drawers, each can be separately warded.
        </p>
        <p>
          When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A
          <i>glyph </i>can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of
          your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the <i>glyph </i>and
          tracery become nearly invisible.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Glyphs </i><span>cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled.
            <i>오도</i>, <i>변이</i>, and
            <i>탐지방어 </i>(and similar magical effects) can fool a
            <i>glyph</i>, though nonmagical 변장 and the like can’t.
            <i>마법 읽기 </i>allows you to 식별 a
            <i>수호의 문양 </i>with a DC 13 주문학 check. Identifying the
            <i>glyph </i>does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature
            of the <i>glyph </i>(version, type of 피해 caused, what spell is
            stored).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Note: </i><span>마법 함정 such as <i>수호의 문양 </i>are hard to detect and 행동불능화. A
            도적(only) can use 탐색 skill to find the <i>glyph </i>and 장치 무력화 to
            thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell 레벨, or 28 for
            <i>수호의 문양</i>.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on the version selected, a <i>glyph </i>either blasts the intruder
          or activates a spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Blast Glyph: </i><span>A <i>blast glyph </i>deals 1d8 points of 피해 per two 시전자 레벨(maximum

            sonic (caster의 choice, made at time of casting). Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take

          <i>Lost 문: </i><span>One door per 시전자 레벨 is covered by a <i>침묵의 환영 </i>to appear as
            if it were a plain wall. 내성 굴림: Will disbelief (if interacted with). 주문 저항: No.</span>
        </p>
        <p>In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects.</p>
        <p>
          1. <i>춤추는 빛 </i>in four 통로. You can designate a simple program that
          causes 빛 to repeat as long as the <i>방어와 수호 </i>spell lasts. 내성 굴림:
          None. 주문 저항: No.
        </p>
        <p>2. A <i>마법의 입 </i>in two places. 내성 굴림: None. 주문 저항: No.</p>
        <p>
          3. A <i>냄새나는 구름 </i>in two places. The vapors appear in the places you
          designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the
          <i>방어와 수호 </i>spell lasts. 내성 굴림: Fortitude negates; see text for
          <i>냄새나는 구름. </i>주문 저항: No.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. A <i>돌풍 </i>in one corridor or room. 내성 굴림: Fortitude negates. 주문
          저항: Yes.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. A <i>제안 </i>in one place. You select an 범위 of up to 5 feet square, and
          any creature who enters or passes through 범위 receives the
          <i>제안 </i>mentally. 내성 굴림: Will negates. 주문 저항: Yes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole warded 범위 radiates strong magic of 회피술 학파. A
          <i>마법 무효화 </i>cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only
          that effect. A successful <i>마법사의 분열 </i>destroys the entire
          <i>방어와 수호 </i>effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Material Component: </i><span>Burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, and a small amount of blood.</span>

          This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that originates from you, affecting all
          creatures in its path.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4x10 feet, taking 1d4 points of
          비치명적인 피해 per 10 feet. If flying, a Tiny or smaller creature is blown back 2d6x10 feet and takes 2d6
          points of 비치명적인 피해 due to battering and buffeting.
        </p>
        <p>Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6x10 feet.</p>
        <p>
          Medium creatures are unable to 이동 forward against the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6x5
          feet.
        </p>
        <p>Large or larger creatures may 이동 normally within a <i>돌풍 </i>effect.</p>
        <p>A <i>돌풍 </i>can’t 이동 a creature beyond the limit of its 거리.</p>
        <p>
          Any creature, regardless of size, takes a –4 페널티 on ranged 공격 and 듣기 checks in 범위 of a
          <i>돌풍</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The force of the <i>gust </i>automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and
          similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a
          50% chance to extinguish those 빛.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the effects noted, a <i>돌풍 </i>can do anything that a sudden
          blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire,
          overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its
          거리.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>돌풍 </i><span>can be made permanent with a <i>영구화 </i>spell.</span>
