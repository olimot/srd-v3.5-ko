Still, they all share a tiny spark of deific energy, which grants them the qualities described in below. (Note: deity rules are used, abominations are rank 0 deities.) </p><p><strong>면역 (범):</strong> Abominations are immune to polymorphing, petrification, or any form-altering attack. They are not subject to energy drain, ability drain, or ability damage. They are immune to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and are immune to one of five energy types (specific to the abomination). </p><p><strong>저항 (범):</strong> Abominations have fire resistance 20, cold resistance 20, and damage reduction of at least 10/epic (certain abominations have higher damage reduction). Abominations all have significant spell resistance. Abominations resist detection, and are all treated as if affected by a <i>nondetection</i> spell of a caster level equal to the abomination’s HD. </p><p><strong>특성 (범):</strong> All abominations have the spell-like ability to use <i>true seeing</i> at will. Abominations are not subject to death from massive damage, and they have maximum hit points per Hit Die. Abominations have the blindsight extraordinary ability to a range of 500 feet. Abominations can choose both nonepic and epic feats as part of their feat selection. </p><p><strong>정신감응 (초):</strong> Abominations can communicate telepathically with any creature within 1,000 feet that has a language. </p><p><strong><i>생명체 소환</i>(주):</strong> Abominations can summon creatures associated either with the portfolio of their godly progenitor or with their imprisonment. Summoned creatures serve the abomination without question. Summoned creatures automatically return whence they came after 1 hour, or sooner if slain. See specific abomination entries for additional details on summoning. </p><p><strong>빠른 치료 및 재생:</strong> Most abominations have some measure of fast healing and regeneration, ranging from 5 to 55 for both abilities. Usually, higher HD abominations have higher values for fast healing and regeneration, though this not always the case. If an abomination has regeneration, it is usually subject to normal damage from at least two sources, one of which is the antithesis for their subtype, and the other of which is somehow tied to some unique feature of the abomination. </p><p><strong>고유 갑옷:</strong> All abominations have some degree of natural armor bonus ranging from +10 to +100. Usually, higher HD abominations have higher natural armor bonuses, but this is not always the case. </p><p><strong>유사주문 능력:</strong> All abominations have access to a variety of spells in the form of spell-like abilities, which they can use as 20th- or higher-level casters, depending on the abomination. No rule governs how many or how few spell-like abilities an abomination may claim. </p><p><strong>유니크 능력:</strong> All abominations have at least one or more unique abilities tied to their godly parent’s portfolio, or to the manner of their incarceration. </p><p><strong>주문 저항:</strong> As a general rule of thumb, abominations have spell resistance equal to their CR +12. </p><p>Abominations speak Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, and often a language associated with their imprisonment. </p></section></section></section><section id="h1-4-anaxim"><h1>아낙심</h1><div class="table-container"><table style="min-width: 51.9501em;" data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td style="min-width: 10.875em;"></td><td style="min-width: 40.5751em;">중간-크기 Construct (이세계, 질서)</td></tr><tr><th>히트 다이스:</th><td>38d10 (420 hp)</td></tr><tr><th>선제권:</th><td>+7 (민)</td></tr><tr><th>속도:</th><td>60 ft., 비행 200 ft.

This is not an illusion or phantasm; the dream larva truly becomes, for just that instant, the subject’s worst nightmare. Even if simultaneously viewed by dozens of different creatures, the dream larva appears differently to each one of them. Creatures immune to fear or mind-affecting effects (or warded by <i>protection from evil</i> or <i>death ward</i> spells) are immune to worst nightmare; all others must make a Will save (DC 43) or die from the supernatural horror revealed. Survivors (and those resurrected) are immune to the effect from that individual dream larva in the future.

Dream larvae can use improved grab on a creature of any size. The dream larva has the option to conduct the grapple normally, simply use the claw or pincer to hold the opponent, or use sending (see below) on the opponent. Each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the damage listed for the attack that established the hold, unless it used sending on the victim.</p><p><strong>송신 (초):</strong> Grappled victims may be physically sent into a nightmare, at the dream larva’s option, on the dream larva’s next action after establishing the grapple. Victims must make a Will save (DC 43) or be apparently swarmed by thousands of worms making up the dream larva’s body. The victim is actually cast into a shrieking maelstrom of dream where it can take no actions but observe. The victim physically returns 2d4 rounds later, apparently ejected from the dream larva’s body (but appearing even if if the dream larva has left or is otherwise absent).

Of course, to the victim no time passes at all, but each apparent round experienced by the phane ages the victim 1d4 years, at the same time healing the phane of 20 hit points of damage.

The phane can never summon a past <i>time duplicate</i> of a creature with more than 25 HD (add sufficient negative levels to compensate for high foe HD, if necessary).

To use this power, it selects any target it can see within 300 feet. The target is allowed a Fortitude saving throw (DC 36). If the target makes its saving throw, it gains four negative levels (this does not count as a use of trap the soul). If the target fails its save, the soul of the target is instantly drawn from its body and trapped within one of the gems incorporated into the demilich’s form. The gem gleams for 24 hours, indicating the captive soul within. The soulless body collapses in a mass of corruption and molders in a single round, reduced to dust. If left to its own devices, the demilich slowly devours the soul over 24 hours—at the end of that time the soul is completely absorbed, and the victim is forever gone. If the demilich is overcome before the soul is eaten, crushing the gem releases the soul, after which time it is free to seek the afterlife or be returned to its body by the use of either <i>resurrection,</i><i>true resurrection, clone,</i> or <i>miracle.</i> A potential victim protected by a <i>death ward</i> spell is not immune to trap the soul, but receives a +5 bonus on its Fortitude saving throw andis effective against the level loss on a successful save.

(perfect) or the lich’s supernatural (not natural) fly speed, whichever is better. </p><p><strong>AC:</strong> The demilich retains the lich’s +5 natural armor bonus and gains an insight bonus equal to AC equal to its Hit Dice, as well as a probable size adjustment to AC. </p><p><strong>공격:</strong> The demilich gains an insight bonus equal to its Hit Dice as a bonus on its touch attacks.</p><p><strong>피해:</strong> The demilich gains an enhanced touch attack over that of its previous lich form (it now uses its entire flying skull to make the touch attack), including paralyzing touch. The demilich’s touch attack uses negative energy to deal 10d6+20 points of damage to living creatures (no saving throw). Liches with other natural attacks lose them. </p><p><strong>특수 공격:</strong> The demilich retains all the lich’s special attacks and also gains those described below. </p><p><strong><i>영혼의 덫 (초):</i></strong>A demilich can trap the souls of up to eight living creatures per day. To use this power, it selects any target it can see within 300 feet. The target is allowed a Fort saving throw (DC 10 + demilich’s HD + demilich’s Cha modifier). If the target makes its saving throw, it gains four negative levels (this does not count as a use of trap the soul). If the target fails its save, the soul of the target is instantly drawn from its body and trapped within one of the gems incorporated into the demilich’s form. The gem gleams wickedly for 24 hours, indicating the captive soul within. The soulless body collapses in a mass of corruption and molders in a single round, reduced to dust. If left to its own devices, the demilich slowly devours the soul over 24 hours—at the end of that time the soul is completely absorbed, and the victim is forever gone. If the demilich is overcome before the soul is eaten, crushing the gem releases the soul, after which time it is free to seek the afterlife or be returned to its body by the use of either <i>resurrection,</i><i>true resurrection, clone,</i> or <i>miracle.</i> If the demilich is overcome before the soul is eaten, crushing the gem releases the soul, after which time it is free to seek the afterlife or be returned to its body by the use of either <i>resurrection,</i><i>true resurrection, clone,</i> or <i>miracle.</i> A potential victim protected by a <i>death ward</i> spell is not immune to trap the soul, but receives a +5 bonus on its Fortitude saving throw andis effective against the level loss on a successful save. </p><p><strong><i>공포 오라 (초):</i> </strong>Demiliches are shrouded in a dreadful aura of death and evil. Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60- foot radius that look at the demilich must succeed at a Will save (DC 14 + demilich’s Cha modifier) or be affected as though by <i>fear</i> as cast by a 21st-level caster. </p><p><strong><i>마비의 손길 (초):</i> </strong>Any living creature a demilich touches must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + demilich’s HD + demilich’s Cha modifier) or be permanently paralyzed. <i>Remove paralysis</i> or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim. The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a demilich seems dead, though a successful Spot check (DC 20) or Heal check (DC 15) reveals that the victim is still alive. </p><p>Spells: The demilich can cast any spells it could cast as a lich. </p><p><em>완벽한 자동 부동 주문:</em> The demilich can cast all the spells it knows without gestures. </p><p><strong>유사주문 능력:</strong> At will—<i>alter self, astral projection, create greater undead, create undead, death knell, enervation, greater dispel magic, harm</i> (usually used to heal itself ), <i>summon monster I–IX, telekinesis,</i> and <i>weird;</i> 2/day— <i>greater planar ally.</i> Demiliches use these abilities as casters of a level equal to their spellcaster level, but the save DCs are equal to 10 + the demilich’s HD + the demilich’s Charisma modifier. </p><p><strong>특성:</strong> The demilich retains all the lich’s special qualities and also has those described below. </p><p><strong><i>마법 면역 (범):</i></strong>Demiliches are immune to all magical and supernatural effects, except as follows. A <i>shatter</i> spell affects a demilich as if it were a crystalline creature, but deals half the damage normally indicated. A <i>dispel evil</i> spell deals 3d6 points of damage (Fort save for half damage). <i>Holy smite</i> spells affect demiliches normally. </p><p><strong><i>부적 양도 (초):</i></strong>Headbands, belts, rings, cloaks, and other wearable items kept in close association with the demilich’s phylactery transfer all their benefits to the demilich no matter how far apart the demilich and the phylactery are located. The standard limits on types of items utilized simultaneously still apply. </p><p><strong><i>언데드 특성:</i></strong>Immune to poison, <i>sleep,</i> paralysis, stunning, disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, mind-affecting effects, and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Negative energy heals. Not at risk of death from massive damage, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less. Darkvision 60 ft. Cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature is willing. </p><p><strong><i>면역 (범):</i></strong>Demiliches are immune to cold, electricity, polymorph, and mind-affecting attacks. </p><p><strong><i>구마 저항 (범):</i> </strong>A demilich has turn resistance +20. </p><p><strong><i>피해 축소 (초):</i></strong>A demilich loses any previous damage reduction and instead has damage reduction 15/Epic and bludgeoning (15 points of damage is subtracted from all melee attacks unless the weapon used is both an epic and a bludgeoning weapon). Vorpal weapons, no matter their enhancement bonus, ignore this damage reduction but do only half damage to a demilich (demiliches cannot be beheaded). </p><p><strong><i>저항 (범):</i></strong>Demiliches have acid resistance 20, fire resistance 20, and sonic resistance 20. </p><p><strong>내성 굴림:</strong> Same as the lich. </p><p><strong>능력:</strong> A demilich gains +10 to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. </p><p><strong>스킬:</strong> Demiliches receive a +20 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks. Otherwise same as the lich (this overlaps with the previous racial bonus gained by the lich; it does not stack). </p><p><strong>특기:</strong> Same as the lich. </p><p><strong>에픽 특기:</strong> Demiliches gain the feats Blinding Speed, Tenacious Magic, and Automatic Quicken Spell. </p><p><strong>날씨/지형:</strong> Same as the lich. </p><p><strong>집단:</strong> Solitary or consistory (1 demilich and 3–6 liches). </p><p><strong>도전 지수:</strong> Same as the lich + 6. </p><p><strong>전리품:</strong> Same as the lich. </p><p><strong>성향:</strong> Any evil. </p><p><strong>성장:</strong> By character class. </p></section><section id="h2-41-demilich-characters"><h2>데밀리치 캐릭터</h2><p>The process of becoming a demilich can be undertaken only by a lich acting of its own free will.

Demiliches also have eight soul gems, each of which acts like a phylactery in its own right. If all the soul gems, as well as the demilich’s phylactery, are not destroyed after a demilich is downed, the demilich reappears 1d10 days after its apparent death. The soul gems also allow the demilich to use its most devastating ability, trap the soul (see above). Each demilich must make its own soul gems, which requires the Craft Wondrous Item feat. The lich must be a sorcerer, wizard, or cleric of at least 21st level. Each soul gem costs 120,000 gp and 4,800 XP to create and has a caster level equal to that of its creator at the time of creation. Soul gems appear as egg-shaped gems of wondrous quality. They are always incorporated directly into the concentrated form of the demilich. </p></section></section><section id="h1-43-devastation-vermin"><h1>황폐 해충</h1><p><strong>해충 특성:</strong> Immune to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). </p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><th style="min-width: 20.4001em;">황폐 지네</th><th style="min-width: 20.4001em;">황폐 거미</th></tr><tr><td>초대형 해충</td><td>초대형 해충</td></tr><tr><th>히트 다이스:</th><td>128d8+1,152 (1,728 hp)</td><td>128d8+1,280 (1,856 hp)</td></tr><tr><th>선제권:</th><td>+13 (민)</td><td>+14 (민)</td></tr><tr><th>속도:</th><td>80 ft.</td><td>60 ft., 등반 40 ft.

The following rules let dragons improve more than their Hit Dice as they progress to epic heights of power. </p><p><strong>나이 범주:</strong> A standard dragon gains one “virtual age category” for every 3 Hit Dice it gains beyond the great wyrm stage. Abilities that function once per day per age category or otherwise use the dragon’s age category as part of a calculation use this adjusted number. Epic dragons gain one age category per 5 Hit Dice beyond great wyrm. </p><p><strong>크기:</strong> One important element of dragon advancement is increasing size. The dragons that don’t reach Colossal size by the great wyrm stage can never reach it according to the standard advancement rules. When advancing a dragon, consider its basic size group: lesser (white, black, brass, and copper dragons), ordinary (green, blue, and bronze dragons), greater (silver, red, and gold), or epic (force and prismatic). A dragon that is Tiny as a wyrmling is in the lesser group, a dragon that is Small as a wyrmling and never reaches Colossal size is in the ordinary group, and a dragon that is Small to Large as a wyrmling and reaches Colossal by the great wyrm stage is in the greater group. A lesser dragon becomes Colossal when it gains two age categories (6 Hit Dice) beyond great wyrm. It increases to Colossal+ when it gains an additional four age categories (12 HD). An ordinary dragon becomes Colossal when it gains one age category (3 Hit Dice) beyond great wyrm. It increases to Colossal+ when it gains an additional four age categories (12 HD). A greater dragon becomes Colossal+ when it gains four age categories (12 HD) more than it needed to reach the Colossal size. </p><p>Epic dragons, already Colossal+ by the time they reach the great wyrm stage, do not increase in size thereafter. Use the information presented under the epic dragon entry, below, to determine the statistics of a Colossal+ dragon. </p><p><strong>방어도:</strong> A dragon’s natural armor bonus increases by +1 for every Hit Die it gains beyond the great wyrm stage. (This rule applies for lesser dragon advancement as well, since natural armor and Hit Dice always increase at the same rate.) </p><p><strong>브레스 무기:</strong> If a dragon’s breath weapon deals damage, the damage typically increases by 2 dice for every virtual age category the dragon gains. The two exceptions among standard dragonsare the brass and white dragons, whose breath weapon damage increases by only 1 die per age category. The saving throw DC against a dragon’s breath weapon remains 10 + 1/2 the dragon’s Hit Dice + its Constitution modifier. </p><p><strong>주문 저항:</strong> For standard advanced dragons, spell resistance increases by 2 per additional age category. For epic dragons, spell resistance increases by 3 (for force dragons) or 6 (for prismatic dragons) per additional age category. </p><p><strong>속도:</strong> When a dragon becomes Colossal, its fly speed increases by 50 feet and its maneuverability becomes clumsy. When it reaches Colossal+, its fly speed increases by another 50 feet, and its maneuverability remains clumsy. A dragon’s land speed and other special movement types (swim, burrow, and so on) do not change. </p><p><strong>능력치:</strong> A great wyrm’s Strength and Constitution scores both increase by +2 for every virtual age category the dragon gains. Its Dexterity remains unchanged. Its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma increase by +2 for every two age categories the dragon gains. </p><p><strong>특수 능력:</strong> Dragons do not gain additional spell-like abilities, but their damage reduction continues to increase as they gain Hit Dice. For most dragons (the exceptions being the force and prismatic dragons), the great wyrm’s damage reduction increases to 15/epic after exceeding the great wyrm age category and the dragon’s natural weapons count as epic weapons for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction.</p><p>Force and prismatic dragons have the following DR progression: wyrmling 10/magic, young 15/magic, young adult 15/epic, mature adult 20/epic, very old 25/epic.</p><p><em>시전자 레벨:</em> A great wyrm’s caster level increases by 2 for every virtual age category the dragon gains. As with the epic dragons described later, advanced dragons gain the Improved Spell Capacity feat as a bonus feat once for every three caster levels above 20th. </p><p><strong>특기:</strong> Like ordinary dragons, advanced dragons receive one feat for every 3 Hit Dice they have. Feats gained after the dragon attains great wyrm status can be epic feats. </p><p><strong>도전 지수:</strong> For standard dragons, CR increases by 2 per additional age category.

In this form, the elemental can move through the air or along a surface at its fly speed. A primal air whirlwind is 10 feet wide at the base, 40 feet wide at the top, and up to 80 feet tall. The elemental controls its exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet. Gargantuan or smaller creatures might take damage when caught in the whirlwind and may be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 53) when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take 4d8 points of damage. It must also succeed at a second Reflex save (DC 53) or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking 4d8 points of damage each round.

The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be. A summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures before returning to its home plane. If the whirlwind’s base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind’s height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have one-half concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud must succeed at a Concentration check (DC 53) to cast a spell.

A primal water elemental can be a serious threat to a ship that crosses its path. It can easily overturn even large craft (ships of up to 5 feet in length per Hit Dice of the elemental) and stop massive vessels (ships of less than 10 feet in length per HD). Even ocean-going behemoths (ships of less than 20 feet in length per HD) can be slowed to half speed. </p><p><strong>흠뻑 적시기 (범):</strong> The elemental’s touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of non-magical origin if these are Gargantuan or smaller.
