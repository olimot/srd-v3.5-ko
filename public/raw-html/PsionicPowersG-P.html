        <p>
          You create a finite plane with limited access: a demiplane. Demiplanes created by this power are very small,
          very minor 이세계. This power works best when manifested while you are on 영적 세계. Manifestation of this
          power creates a local density fluctuation that precipitates the creation of a demiplane. At first, the
          fledgling plane grows in radius at a rate of 1 foot per day to an initial maximum radius of 180 feet as it
          rapidly draws substance from the surrounding astral ectoplasm. Once the new demiplane reaches its maximum
          size, it doesn’t really stop growing, but its growth rate decreases to only 1 foot per week (approximately a
          50-foot increase in radius per year). Once your demiplane is created, you can travel to it using
          <i>영적 마차</i>, <i>이세계 전이</i>, or
          some other power or permanent link that you arrange for separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          You determine 환경 within the demiplane when you manifest
          <i>창세, </i>reflecting most any desire you can visualize. You determine
          factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the general shape of the terrain. This power cannot create
          life (including vegetation), nor can it create 제작(such as buildings, roads, wells, 던전, and so forth). You
          must add these details in some other fashion if you desire. You can’t create lingering psionic effects with
          this power; you have to add those separately, if desired. Similarly, you can’t create a demiplane out of
          esoteric material, such as silver or uranium; you’re limited to stone and dirt. You can’t manipulate the time
          trait on your demiplane; its time trait is as 물질 세계. Once your demiplane reaches 180 feet in radius, you
          can manifest this power again to gradually add another 180 feet of radius to it, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Antigenesis: If <i>창세 </i>is manifested on 물질 세계, the power takes
          effect and the demiplane begins to grow at the rate noted above, but it gets no larger than a radius of 1 foot
          per 레벨. The energies of the new plane are exactly canceled by the energies of the original plane, creating a
          죽음 감지 like a limited cancer on the original plane. The expanding boundary of 죽음 감지 wipes away all
          제작, crumbles natural land forms, and evaporates water, leaving behind a uniformly 레벨 범위 of inert dust.
          Living creatures that pass the boundary of the growing 죽음 감지 are not directly affected, but plants can
          find no 생활 유지 in the dust of 죽음 감지, water-breathing creatures die quickly when water turns to dust,
          and mobile animals know enough to leave 범위 alone. Once the wave of change passes, no special essence remains
          in 죽음 감지, and it may be colonized naturally over the course of several years by bacteria, plants, and
          animals.

          You attach any 근접 무기 you can use in one hand—mundane, psionic, or magical—onto the end of one of your
          arms. The weapon becomes a natural extension of your arm, and that hand blends seamlessly into the shaft,
          hilt, or head of the weapon. Now that the weapon and you are one, you gain a +1 적성 보너스 on all 공격
          and 피해 rolls while using the weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The grafted weapon is considered both a standard weapon and a natural weapon for 목적 of effects that
          distinguish between either weapon type. For instance, the grafted weapon is treated as a natural weapon for
          목적 of delivering a touch 공격 with a power in conjunction with the weapon 공격. As with any power (or spell)
          melee touch 공격 made in conjunction with a natural weapon 공격, the touch 공격 effect is not delivered unless
          the natural weapon strikes normally; on a failed 공격, the touch power (or spell) is wasted.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a 사이킥 군인 under the effect of the <i>야수의 발톱 </i>power, grafting
          a weapon means that 공격 with this hand deal the base 피해 of the weapon, instead of the claw upon which a
          사이킥 군인 normally relies.
        </p>
        <p>
          While your hand is grafted to a weapon, you lose the use of that hand and take a –2 페널티 on all 스킬 판정
          requiring the use of hands. Powers that temporarily 변이 or metamorph you can ignore the grafted weapon or
          alter it normally, at your discretion. If the weapon takes 피해, you take 피해 as well. If you are healed, so
          is your grafted weapon. If your weapon is destroyed, you permanently lose 2 points of 건강; the ability drain
          persists until you can restore your natural anatomy (by means of
          <i>재생 </i>or a similar effect).
        </p>
        <p>When this power의 지속시간 expires, the grafted weapon falls to the ground and your hand returns.</p>

          A tiny ectoplasmic crystal emanates from your outstretched hand and rapidly expands to a 2-foot-diameter ball
          of crystal as it 속도 toward the location you designate. You can choose to aim this crystal at a single target

          You are almost impossible to 이동. Your weight does not vary; instead, you mentally attach yourself to the
          underlying fabric of the plane. Thus, you could conceivably anchor yourself in midair. Any creature attempting
          to physically 이동 you must succeed on an opposed 근력 check, and you gain a +20 보너스 on the check. You
          can’t voluntarily 이동 to a new location unless you stop concentrating, which ends the power.
        </p>
        <p>You cannot apply your 민첩 보너스 to 방어도; however, your anchored body gains 피해 축소 15/–.</p>
        <p>
          You cannot make physical 공격 or 공연 any other large-scale 이동(you can make smallscale 이동, such as
          breathing, turning your head, moving your eyes, talking, and so on). Powers with the teleportation descriptor,
          or any telekinetic effect, manifested on you automatically fail.

          You generally know where you are. This power is useful to characters who end up at unfamiliar destinations
          after teleporting, using a <i>관문, </i>or traveling to or from other 이세계
          of existence. The power reveals general information about your location as a feeling or presentiment. The
          information is usually no more detailed than a summary that locates you according to a prominent local or
          regional site. Using this power also tells you what direction you are facing.

          You raise a field of potentiality that drains the vitality from powers that you successfully save against.
          When you succeed on a 내성 굴림 to negate the effect of a foe의 power on you, and the power is one that

          You link your psychic might with other 사이오닉 생명체, creating an entity more powerful than the sum of its
          parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you manifest this power, a number of 파워 포인트 you designate flows from each participant into a
          collective pool. One individual is chosen as the <i>메타콘서트 </i>conductor
          by mutual consent of the other participants (this is usually the manifester, but doesn’t have to be). Until
          the power ends, this conductor directs the efforts of the group. Misty strands of glowing power link the brows
          of all the participants in a complex and shifting pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the powers of each participant are known to the mental entity ccreated with
          <i>메타콘서트 </i>(which is under the conductor의 명령). This entity can’t
          take any more actions than a normal individual, but it manifests all its powers more effectively. Each
          participant contributing to the entity provides a cumulative +1 보너스 to save DCs that apply when manifesting
          a power or using a psi-like ability. Likewise, each individual provides a cumulative +1 보너스 when the entity
          makes its own 내성 굴림 in response to powers or 유사사이오닉 능력.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the psionic entity takes ability 피해 from a psionic attackthe total is divided among all the members as
          determined by the conductor.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the entity manifests a power that has an XP cost, all the participants pay an equal share (the conductor
          pays the remainder if the cost can’t be divided evenly).
        </p>
        <p>
          Once linked, the participants must remain within a 20-foot-radius 범위, and as a group can 이동 at a 속도 of
          10 feet. If a participant 이동 outside the 20-foot-radius 범위 occupied by the others (whether willingly or
          involuntarily), that individual drops out of the group, and the power point pool of the
          <i>메타콘서트 </i>is instantly recalculated.
        </p>
        <p>
          All participants who leave before a <i>메타콘서트 </i>ends or is dismissed
          reclaim a number of 파워 포인트 equal to the current power point pool divided by the number of members. If the
          conductor drops out, the power ends. That same number of points is removed from the power point pool.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a <i>메타콘서트 </i>ends normally or is dismissed, remaining 파워 포인트
          in the pool are divided among all the participants (the conductor receives the remainder if the points can’t
          be divided evenly).

        <p>
          You assume the form of a creature of the same type as your normal form, or any other type except construct,
          정령, outsider, and undead. The assumed form can have as many 히트 다이스 as your 구현자 레벨, to a maximum of
          15.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can’t assume a form smaller than Fine, nor can you assume an incorporeal, ectoplasmic, or 기체 형태. You
          cannot take the form of any creature that has a template. Your type and subtype (if applicable) change to
          match the new form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon changing, you regain lost 히트 포인트 as if you had rested for a night (though this 치료 does not restore
          ability 피해 and provide other benefits of resting; and changing back does not 치료 you further). If you are
          slain while under the effect of this power, you revert to your original form, though you remain 죽음. You gain
          근력, 민첩, and 건강 scores of the new form but retain your own 지능, 지혜, and 매력 scores. You also gain all
          extraordinary 특수 공격 possessed by the form (such as constrict, improved grab, and 독) but do not gain the
          extraordinary 특성 possessed by the new form (such as blindsense, 빠른 치료, 재생, and 냄새) or any
          supernatural, psionic, or spelllike 능력.
        </p>
        <p>
          You retain all supernatural and 유사주문 특수 능력과 특성 of your normal form, except for those requiring a
          body part that the new form does not have, if any. You keep all extraordinary 특수 능력과 특성 derived from
          직업 레벨, but you lose any benefits of the racial traits of your normal form. If you have a template, 특수
          능력 it provides are likewise not retained. If the assumed form is capable of speech, you can communicate
          normally. You retain any manifesting ability you had in your original form.
        </p>
        <p>
          You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind. Physical qualities include
          natural size, mundane 이동 capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with
          wings, to a maximum 속도 of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying 이동), 자연 갑옷 보너스, natural
          무기(such as claws or a bite), racial 보너스 on 스킬 판정, racial 보너스 특기, and any anatomical qualities
          (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow
          you to make more 공격(or more advantageous two-weapon 공격) than normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can freely designate the new form의 minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin
          color) within the normal 거리 for a creature of that type. The new form의 significant physical qualities (such
          as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new
          form의 species. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form의 race. If you use this
          power to create a 변장, you get a +10 보너스 on your 변장 check.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the change occurs, your 장비 either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or
          holding the item in question) or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to your
          normal form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they
          previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can’t wear
          in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body
          part common to both forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are still held in the same way.
          Any part of the body or piece of 장비 that is separated from the whole reverts to its normal form.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also use this power to assume the form of an inanimate object. You gain the object의 hardness and
          retain your own 히트 포인트. You can take the shape of almost any simple object you can think of. If you
          attempt to take the form of a complex object, you must make an appropriate skill check.. If you fail the
          check, your manifestation of the power does not succeed. Likewise, you cannot take the form of a complex
          mechanical mechanism unless you have some sort of skill associated with the object. You cannot use this power
          to assume the form of a psionic item or a magic item, or any object with a hardness of 15 or higher. You also
          cannot take the form of a psionically animated mechanism or any object formed of ectoplasm.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an inanimate object, you lose all 기동성. You retain your normal senses and your ability to 말하기. You can
          manifest a power if you make a 집중 check (DC 20 + power 레벨); however, doing so ends 지속시간 of this power.
          If you take 피해 while in the form of an object, your actual body also takes 피해(but the object의 hardness,
          if any, protects you).

          This power enables you to warp the consciousness and senses of one or more creatures, 송신 the victim into a
          catatonic state. When <i>소우주 </i>is manifested, you can target either a
          single creature within 거리 or a group of creatures all located within the power의 범위.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Single Target: </i><span>If <i>소우주 </i>targets a single creature, that creature의 senses are
            pinched off from the real world if it currently has 100 or fewer 히트 포인트. The subject의 senses are all
            completely fabricated from within its own mind, though it may not realize this. In reality, the subject
            sprawls limply, drooling and mewling, and eventually dies of thirst and starvation without care. The subject
            lives within its own made-up world until the time of its actual death.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>범위 Effect: </i><span>If <i>소우주 </i>is manifested on an 범위, it sends all affected creatures
            into a shared catatonia (the world is a construct, but within the world, the victims can interact with each
            other). It affects only creatures that currently have 30 or fewer 히트 포인트, and only up to a total of 300
            히트 포인트 of such creatures. The power affects creatures with the lowest hit point totals first.

        <p>
          Manifesting <i>소우주 </i>a second time on an affected creature turns its

          You impress the totality of your psyche into a subject의 subconscious. If successfully implanted, the seed of

          While the subject is initially your mental duplicate, the two personalities diverge over time. Although the
          subject starts off with memories of your experiences, it possesses its original “soul” and physical body and
          is free to develop its own personality based on its own new experiences. Thus, the subject is not your slave
          or servant, but instead a nonplayer character in its own right that shares your earlier memories.

          You can attempt to take control of a nearby living creature, forcing your mind (and soul) into its body, and
          its mind into your body. You can target any creature whose 히트 다이스 are equal to or less than your 구현자
          레벨.
        </p>
        <p>
          You possess the target의 body and force the creature의 mind into your body unless it succeeds on a Will save.
          You can 이동 your mind back into your own body whenever you desire, which returns the subject의 mind to its
          own body and ends the power. If the manifestation succeeds, your life force occupies the host body, and the
          host의 life force takes over yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can call on rudimentary or instinctive 지식 of the subject creature, but not upon its acquired or learned
          지식(such as 스킬 and 특기 it possesses). The same is true for the subject in your body. The
          <i>정신 개폐 </i>brings about the following changes.
        </p>
        <p>• You gain the type of your assumed body.</p>
        <p>• You gain 근력, 민첩, and 건강 scores of your assumed body.</p>
        <p>
          • You gain the 자연 갑옷, natural 공격, 이동, and other simple physical characteristics of your assumed
          body.
        </p>
        <p>
          • You gain the extraordinary 특수 공격 and qualities of your assumed body, but you do not gain supernatural or
          유사주문 능력.
        </p>
        <p>• You gain the possessions and 장비 of your assumed body.</p>
        <p>
          • You retain your own 히트 포인트, 내성 굴림(possibly modified by new 능력 점수), class 능력, supernatural and
          유사주문 능력, 주문 and powers, and 스킬 and 특기(although 스킬 판정 use your new 능력 점수, and you may be
          temporarily unable to 특기 사용 whose 필요조건 you do not meet in your new body).
        </p>
        <p>Supernatural 능력 that require a certain body part may be unavailable in your new form.</p>
        <p>
          If either body is killed while the power is in effect, the other participant also dies when the power ends. If
          one participant의 body becomes petrified, imprisoned by <i>시간 동결 </i>or
          <i>감금, </i>or incapacitated in some other way, the other participant will
          be incapacitated in that way when the power ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          A targeted <i>사이오닉 무효화 </i>(or similar 주문 or effects) successfully
          manifested on either participant causes both minds to return to their original bodies.

          As <i>정신 개폐, </i>except as noted here. You permanently exchange bodies
          with the subject. Since this power의 지속시간 is instantaneous, you cannot be forced to return to your natural
          body by means of <i>사이오닉 무효화, </i>an
          <i>대마법 보호장, </i>or a similar effect. If the subject의 body dies while
          you are in it, you are 죽음. The subject immediately loses one 레벨, but otherwise survives the experience in
          your natural body. If your natural body dies while the subject is in it, you immediately lose one 레벨, but
          you likewise survive the experience in your new body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your “natural” body is always considered to be the last one you switched out of. If you exchange bodies with a
          chain of multiple subjects, you need worry only about the welfare of the last body you switched with. In other
          words, if your mind is expelled from your current body, your mind returns to the last body you switched with,
          not to your original body. Similarly, if your original body dies but you have since switched minds with a
          second subject, you take no 페널티. You lose a 레벨 only if the body you inhabited immediately prior to your
          current body is killed.

          against you. You can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain its benefit in an emergency.
          Manifesting the power is an immediate action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the
          normal limit of one quickened power per round. You can use this power even when it is not your turn.

        </p>
        <p>
          Borrowing the subject의 power is a separate standard action that provokes an 공격 of opportunity. If that 공격

          An invisible barrier surrounds you and 이동 with you. The space within this barrier is impervious to most
          psionic effects, including powers, 유사사이오닉 능력, and supernatural 능력. Likewise, it prevents the
          functioning of any 사이오닉 아이템 or powers within its confines. A
          <i>무의 사이오닉 장 </i>suppresses any power or psionic effect used within,
          brought into, or manifested into its 범위, but does not negate it. Time spent within a
          <i>무의 사이오닉 장 </i>counts against a suppressed effect의 지속시간.
        </p>
        <p>
          영적 구조물 and summoned creatures wink out if they enter a
          <i>무의 사이오닉 장</i>. They reappear in the same 감지 once the field goes
          away. Time spent winked out counts normally against 지속시간 of the power that is maintaining the construct or
          summoned creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creation powers with instantaneous 지속시간 and calling powers are not affected by a
          <i>무의 사이오닉 장 </i>because the power itself is no longer in effect, only
          its result.
        </p>
        <p>
          A normal creature (a normally encountered construct rather than a created one, for instance) can enter the
          범위, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a psionic sword does not function psionically within the
          범위, it is still a sword (and a 명품 sword at that). The power has no effect on 골렘 and other
          constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless
          they have been summoned or have a limited 지속시간, in which case they are treated like any other summoned
          creatures). 정령, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures’
          유사주문 or supernatural 능력, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>사이오닉 무효화 </i><span>does not remove the field. Two or more <i>무의 사이오닉 장 </i>sharing any
            of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain powers may be unaffected by
            <i>무의 사이오닉 장 </i>(see the individual 파워 설명). 유물 and deities
            are unaffected by mortal power such as this. Should a creature의 space extend across the boundary of the
            범위 enclosed by the field, any part of the creature that lies outside the effect is unaffected by the
            field.</span>

          You gain 피해 축소 10/ slashing and a +5 보너스 to 자연 갑옷 that overlaps (does not stack with) any
          자연 갑옷 보너스 you may already have. You are immune to ability 피해, blindness, deafness, 질병, 숨참기,
          독, stunning, and all powers, 주문, or 공격 that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no
          physiology or respiration while this power is in effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          You take only half 피해 from cold effects of all kinds. However, you become susceptible to all 특수 공격 that
          affect wood, and you gain vulnerability to fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          You gain a +4 enhancement 보너스 to 근력, but you take a –2 페널티 to 민첩(to a minimum 민첩 score of 1), and
          your 속도 is reduced to half normal. You can 말하기 but cannot drink (and thus can’t use 물약) or play wind
          instruments. You have an 갑옷 판정 페널티 of –4 and an 비전 주문 실패 chance of 25%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your unarmed 공격 deal 피해 equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for 소형 캐릭터, 1d6 for Medium characters),
          and you are considered armed when making unarmed 공격. When you make a 전력 공격 against an object or
          structure using your 비무장 공격, you deal double 피해.

          You can learn details of an inanimate object의 previous owner. Objects accumulate psychic impressions left by
          their previous owners, which can be read by use of this power. The amount of information revealed depends on
          how long you study a particular object.
        </p>
        <p><i>1st Minute: </i><span>Last owner의 race.</span></p>
        <p><i>2nd Minute: </i><span>Last owner의 gender.</span></p>

        <p><i>6th+ Minute: </i><span>Next-to-last owner의 race, and so on.</span></p>
        <p>
          The power always correctly identifies the last owner of the item, and the original owner (if you keep the
          power active long enough).
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a 90% chance that this power will successfully 식별 all other former owners in sequence, but there is
          a 10% chance that one former owner will be skipped and thus not identified.
        </p>
        <p>
          This power will not 식별 casual users as owners. (Anyone who uses an object to 공격 someone or something is
          not thereafter considered a casual user.)
        </p>
        <p>
          An object without any previous owners reveals no information. You can continue to 달리기 through a list of
          previous owners and learn details about them as long as the power의 지속시간 lasts. If you use this power
          additional times on the same object, the information yielded is the same as if you were using the power on the
          object for the first time.

          You attempt to briefly partition the mind of your foe, calving off a minor personality that is antagonistic to
          the main personality. The parasitic personality functions with complete autonomy from the main personality. It
          does not control the body physically, but it can take one standard action each round that is purely mental,
          such as manifesting a power, in the same turn that the subject takes its normal actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The parasitic personality manifests powers using the subject의 power point reserve and known powers, but can
          only manifest powers three or more 레벨 lower than the highest 레벨 of power the subject can normally
          manifest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The parasitic personality actively attempts to manifest powers that negatively impact the subject, using the
          highest-레벨 powers possible (so as to deplete the subject의 power point reserve), and the most deadly to the
          subject. You do not have control over what the parasitic personality does, though it always works against the
          interest of the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both minds communicate with each other telepathically. If a creature is targeted by a 충동 or charm effect
          while under the effect of this power, it can make a second 내성 굴림 if the first one fails. If both 내성 굴림
          fail, then this power ends and the creature is affected by the charm or 충동 effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          The parasitic personality does not gain any advantages if the main personality is subjected to a
          <i>가속 </i>or <i>분립 </i>effect.

          <i>예지 </i><span>allows your mind to glimpse fragments of potential future events—what you see will probably happen if no
            one takes action to change it. However, your 시야 is incomplete, and it makes no real sense until the actual
            events you glimpsed begin to unfold. That의 when everything begins to come together, and you can act, if you
            act swiftly, on the information you previously received when you manifested this power.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, manifesting this power grants you a “precognitive edge.” Normally, you can have only a single
          precognitive edge at one time. You must use your edge within a period of no more than 10 minutes per 레벨, at
          which time your preknowledge fades and you lose your edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use your precognitive edge in a variety of ways. Essentially, the edge translates into a +2 insight
          보너스 that you can apply at any time to either an 명중 굴림, a 피해 roll, a 내성 굴림, or a skill check. You
          can elect to apply 보너스 to the roll after you determine that your unmodified roll is lower than desired.

          You gain an enhanced sense of smell, equivalent to 냄새 ability of some 몬스터. This ability allows you to
          detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and 추적 by sense of smell. With 냄새 ability, you can 식별
          familiar odors just as humanoids do familiar sights<i>.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, 거리 increases to 60
          feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong 냄새, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at
          twice 거리 noted above. Overpowering 냄새, such as skunk musk or 트로글로다이트 stench, can be detected at
          triple normal 거리.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you detect a 냄새, the exact location of the source is not revealed—only its presence somewhere within
          거리. You can take a 이동 action to note the direction of 냄새. Whenever you come within 5 feet of the source,
          you pinpoint the source의 location.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have 추적 feat, you can follow 추적 by smell, making a 지혜(or 생존) check to find or follow a 추적.
          The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds 냄새). This DC increases or
          decreases depending on how strong the quarry의 odor is, the number of creatures, and 나이 of the trail. For
          each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for 추적
          feat. If you are tracking with <i>사이오닉 향기, </i>you ignore the effects
          of surface 상태이상 and poor visibility.

          You can repair psychic 피해 or grant another creature 지식 of powers you know, depending on the version of
          this power you manifest.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Repair Psychic 피해: </i><span>You can remove any compulsions and charms affecting the subject. In fact, you can remove any instantaneous
            or permanent effect caused by a psychic power with <i>사이킥 외과의술</i>.
            Unlike with <i>오라 변경</i>, these effects end or are negated as soon as
            this power is manifested, with no need for another 내성 굴림.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can remove all negative 레벨 affecting the subject, regardless of how it lost those 레벨, restoring it to
          the highest 레벨 it had previously attained. Also, you can restore 레벨 lost to 정령 흡수 or a similar effect
          if 레벨 drain occurred within a number of hours equal to your 구현자 레벨.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also remove all psionic effects penalizing the subject의 능력 점수, 치료 all ability 피해, and remove
          any ability drain affecting the subject. <i>Psychic chirurger</i>y negates
          all forms of 광기, 혼란, the effect of such powers as <i>소우주, </i>and so
          on, but it does not restore 레벨 or 건강 points lost due to death.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Transfer 지식: </i><span>If desired, you can use this power to directly transfer 지식 of a power you know to another psionic
            character. You can give a character 지식 of a power of any 레벨 that she can manifest, even if the power is
            not normally on the character의 파워 목록. 지식 of powers gained through
            <i>사이킥 외과의술 </i>does not count toward the maximum number of powers a
            character can know per 레벨.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>XP 비용: </i><span>Each time you use 사이킥 외과의술 to implant 지식 of a power in another creature, you pay an XP cost equal
            to 1,000 x 레벨 of the power implanted. If you and the subject are both willing to do so, you can split this
            cost evenly.</span>

          When this power is manifested, the subject can choose to spend its most recently gained skill points
          differently (picking new 스킬 and abandoning old ones if it chooses) and to choose a different feat from the
          one it selected when advancing from its previous 레벨 to its current 레벨.
        </p>
        <p>
          The subject can also choose to forget powers it acquired when advancing to its current 레벨, replacing them
          with new ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          The subject can undo decisions of these sorts that were made at lower 레벨, if both the subject and the
          manifester agree to pay the necessary XP before this power is manifested (see below). The subject must abide
          by the standard rules for selecting 스킬 and 특기, and so it cannot take 특기 for which it doesn’t qualify or
          take crossclass 스킬 as 직업 스킬.

          <i>XP 비용: </i><span>This power costs 50 XP to manifest to reformat choices made when the character reached her current 레벨.
            For each additional previous 레벨 into which the revision reaches, the power costs an additional 50 XP. The
            manifester and subject split all XP costs evenly.</span>

          This power shrouds your hand or a natural weapon you possess with 암흑 that you can use to drain an opponent의
          power.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you manifest this power to affect your hand, the next successful melee touch 공격 you make (if the victim
          fails its Fortitude save) drains 2 파워 포인트 from your foe for every 구현자 레벨 you have. The drained
          points simply dissipate. Your touch 공격, charged with psionic power, is treated as an armed 공격.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you manifest this power to affect a natural weapon you possess, you must make a successful melee 공격 with
          the weapon to gain the power의 benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Against a psionic being that has no 파워 포인트 or a nonpsionic foe, your 공격 instead deals 2 points of 지능,
          지혜, or 매력 피해(your choice).

          You can readjust your body to boost one physical ability score at the expense of one or more other scores.
          Select one ability score you would like to boost, and increase it by the same amount that you decrease one or
          more other scores. All score decreases are treated as a special form of ability 피해, called ability burn,
          which cannot be magically or psionically healed—it goes away only through natural 치료.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can boost your 근력, 민첩 or 건강 score by an amount equal to your 구현자 레벨(or any 하급 amount),
          assuming you can afford to burn your other 능력 점수 to such an extent.
        </p>
        <p>
          When 지속시간 of this power expires, your ability boost also ends, but your ability burn remains until it is
          healed naturally.
