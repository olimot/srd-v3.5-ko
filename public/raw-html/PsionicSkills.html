        <p>
          <em>마름쇠 상처 무시:</em> If you are wounded by stepping on a caltrop, your speed is reduced to one-half
          normal. A successful Autohypnosis check removes this movement penalty. The wound doesn’t go away—it is just
          ignored through self-persuasion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>암기:</em> You can attempt to memorize a long string of numbers, a long passage of verse, or some other
          particularly difficult piece of information (but you can’t memorize magical writing or similarly exotic
          scripts). Each successful check allows you to memorize a single page of text (up to 800 words), numbers,
          diagrams, or sigils (even if you don’t recognize their meaning). If a document is longer than one page, you
          can make additional checks for each additional page. You always retain this information; however, you can
          recall it only with another successful Autohypnosis check.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>죽어가고 있음 상태 저항:</em> You can attempt to subconsciously prevent yourself from dying. If you have
          negative hit points and are losing hit points (at 1 per round, 1 per hour), you can substitute a DC 15
          Autohypnosis check for your d% roll to see if you become stable. If the check is successful, you stop losing
          hit points (you do not gain any hit points, however, as a result of the check). You can substitute this check
          for the d% roll in later rounds if you are initially unsuccessful.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>공포 저항:</em> In response to any fear effect, you make a saving throw normally. If you fail the saving
          throw, you can make an Autohypnosis check on your next round even while overcome by fear. If your autohypnosis
          check meets or beats the DC for the fear effect, you shrug off the fear. On a failed check, the fear affects
          you normally, and you gain no further attempts to shrug off that particular fear effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>독 견디기:</em> You can choose to substitute an Autohypnosis check for a saving throw against any standard
          poison’s secondary damage or effect. This skill has no effect on the initial saving throw against poison.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>의지력:</em> If reduced to 0 hit points (disabled), you can make an Autohypnosis check. If successful, you
          can take a normal action while at 0 hit points without taking 1 point of damage. You must make a check for
          each strenuous action you want to take. A failed Autohypnosis check in this circumstance carries no direct
          penalty—you can choose not to take the strenuous action and thus avoid the hit point loss. If you do so
          anyway, you drop to –1 hit points, as normal when disabled.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>행동:</strong> None. Making an Autohypnosis check doesn’t require an action; it is either a free
          action (when attempted reactively) or part of another action (when attempted actively).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>다시 시도하기:</strong> Yes, for memorize and willpower uses, though a success doesn’t cancel the
          effects of a previous failure. No for the other uses.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>시너지:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Autohypnosis, you get a +2 bonus on Knowledge
          (psionics) checks.

        <h2>집중<small>(건)</small></h2>
        <p>You are particularly good at focusing your mind.</p>
        <p>The following are additional uses for the concentration skill.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>판정:</strong> You must make a Concentration check whenever you might potentially be distracted (by
          taking damage, by harsh weather, and so on) while engaged in some action that requires your full attention.
          Such actions include manifesting a power, concentrating on an active power, directing a power, or using a
          psi-like ability.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Concentration check succeeds, you can continue with the action as normal. If the check fails, the
          action automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of manifesting a power, the power points
          are lost. If you were concentrating on an active power, the power ends as if you had ceased concentrating on
          it. If you were directing a power, the direction fails but the power remains active. If you were using a
          psi-like ability, that use of the ability is lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          The table below summarizes various types of distractions that cause you to make a Concentration check. If the
          distraction occurs while you are trying to manifest a power, you must add the level of the power you are
          trying to manifest to the appropriate Concentration DC.

        </div>
        <p>
          <em>사이오닉 초점 얻기:</em> Merely holding a reservoir of psionic power points in mind gives psionic
          characters a special energy. Psionic characters can put that energy to work without actually paying a power
          point cost—they can become psionically focused as a special use of the Concentration skill.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have 1 or more power points available, you can meditate to attempt to become psionically focused. The
          DC to become psionically focused is 20. Meditating is a full-round action that provokes attacks of
          opportunity. When you are psionically focused, you can expend your focus on any single Concentration check you
          make thereafter. When you expend your focus in this manner, your Concentration check is treated as if you
          rolled a 15. It’s like taking 10, except that the number you add to your Concentration modifier is 15. You can
          also expend your focus to gain the benefit of a psionic feat—many psionic feats are activated in this way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you are psionically focused, you remain focused until you expend your focus, become unconscious, or go to
          sleep (or enter a meditative trance, in the case of elans), or until your power point reserve drops to 0.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>행동:</strong> Usually none. In most cases, making a Concentration check doesn’t require an action; it
          is either a free action (when attempted reactively) or part of another action (when attempted actively).
          Meditating to gain psionic focus is a full-round action.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>다시 시도하기:</strong> Yes, though a success doesn’t cancel the effects of a previous failure, such
          as the loss of the power points for a power being manifested or the disruption of a power being concentrated
          on.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>특수:</strong> You can use Concentration to manifest a power or use a psi-like ability defensively, so
          as to avoid attacks of opportunity altogether. The DC of the check is 15 + the power’s level. If the
          Concentration check succeeds, you can manifest normally without provoking any attacks of opportunity. If the
          Concentration check fails, the power also automatically fails and the power points are wasted, just as if your
          concentration had been disrupted by a distraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          A character with the Combat Manifestation feat gets a +4 bonus on Concentration checks made to manifest a
          power or use a psi-like ability while on the defensive or while grappling or pinned.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>시너지:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Concentration, you get a +2 bonus on Autohypnosis
          checks.

          Knowledge (psionics) covers ancient mysteries, psionic traditions, psychic symbols, cryptic phrases, astral

        <p>
          Use this skill to activate psionic devices, including power stones (chunks of crystal that store specific
          powers) and dorjes (slender crystal wands charged with several uses of the same power), that otherwise you
          could not activate.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>판정:</strong> You can use this skill to address a power stone (to learn what powers are encoded on
          it) or to activate a psionic item. This skill lets you use a psionic item as if you had the manifesting
          ability or class features of another class, as if you were a different race, or as if you were a different
          alignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          You make Use Psionic Device checks each time you activate a device such as a dorje. If you are using the check
          to emulate an alignment or some other quality in an ongoing manner, you need to make the relevant emulation
          checks once per hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must consciously choose what to emulate. That is, you must know what you are trying to emulate when you
          make an emulation check. The DCs for various tasks involving Use Psionic Device are summarized on the table
          below.

        <p>
          <em>모르는 것 작동시키기:</em> Some psionic items are activated by special specific thoughts or conceptions.
          You can activate such items as if you were using the activation method, even if you’re not and even if you
          don’t know it. You do have to use something equivalent. You have to wave the item around or otherwise attempt
          to get it to activate. You get a special +2 bonus if you’ve activated the item at least once before.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you fail the check by 10 or more, you suffer brainburn. This brainburn affects you in the same way as
          brainburn that can occur when you attempt to manifest a power from a power stone, except that the damage is
          1d4 points per power level instead of 1d6. Brainburn damage from activating blindly is in addition to
          brainburn damage from manifesting a power from a power stone.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>파워스톤 정체 밝히기:</em> Successfully addressing a power stone allows you to find out what power or
          powers it contains. Doing this requires 1 minute of concentration.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>능력 점수 모방하기:</em> To manifest a power from a power stone, you need a high ability score in the
          appropriate ability. Your effective ability score (appropriate to the class you’re emulating when you try to
          manifest the power from the power stone) is your check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough
          score in the appropriate ability, you don’t need to make this check.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>성향 모방하기:</em> Some psionic items have positive or negative effects based on your alignment. Use
          Psionic Device lets you use these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. You can emulate only
          one alignment at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>직업 특성 모방하기:</em> Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a psionic item. Your
          effective level in the emulated class equals your check result minus 20. This skill does not let you use the
          class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had the class feature.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment requirement, you must meet it, either honestly
          or by emulating an appropriate alignment as a separate check (see above).
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>종족모방하기:</em> Some psionic items work only for certain races, or work better for those of certain
          races. You can use such an item as if you were a race of your choice. You can emulate only one race at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>도졔 사용하기:</em> Normally, to use a dorje, you must have the dorje’s power on your class power list.
          This use of the skill allows you to use a dorje as if you had a particular power on your class power list.
          This use of the skill applies to other power trigger psionic items, if applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>파워스톤 사용하기:</em> Normally, to manifest a power from a power stone, you must have the power stone’s
          power on your class power list. This use of the skill allows you to use a power stone as if you had a
          particular power on your class power list. The DC is equal to 20 + the manifester level of the power you are
          trying to manifest from the power stone. <i>Note:</i> Before you use
        </p>
        <p>
          a power stone, you must first have addressed it to determine what powers it contains. In addition, manifesting
          a power from a power stone requires a minimum score (10 + power level) in the appropriate ability. If you
          don’t have a high enough score, you must emulate the ability score with a separate check (see above). This use
          of the skill applies to other power completion

        <p>psionic items.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>행동:</strong> None. The Use Psionic Device check is made as part of the action (if any) required to
          activate the psionic item.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>다시 시도하기:</strong> Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to activate an item and
          you fail, you can’t try to activate it again for a day.
        </p>
        <p><strong>특수:</strong> You cannot take 10 with this skill.</p>
        <p>You can’t aid another on Use Psionic Device checks. Only the user of the item can attempt such a check.</p>
        <p>A character with the Psionic Affinity feat gets a +2 bonus on Use Psionic Device checks.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>시너지:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Psicraft, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device
          checks related to power stones.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Psionic Device, you get a +2 bonus on Psicraft checks to address power
