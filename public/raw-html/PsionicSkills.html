            <i>Ignore Caltrop Wound: </i><span>If you are wounded by stepping on a caltrop, your 속도 is reduced to one-half normal. A successful
              자기최면 check removes this 이동 페널티. The wound doesn’t go away—it is just ignored through
              self-persuasion.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Memorize: </i><span>You can attempt to memorize a long string of numbers, a long passage of verse, or some other particularly
              difficult piece of information (but you can’t memorize magical writing or similarly exotic scripts). Each
              successful check allows you to memorize a single page of text (up to 800 words), numbers, diagrams, or
              sigils (even if you don’t recognize their meaning). If a document is longer than one page, you can make
              additional checks for each additional page. You always retain this information; however, you can recall it
              only with another successful 자기최면 check.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Resist 죽어가고 있음: </i><span>You can attempt to subconsciously prevent yourself from 죽어가고 있음. If you have negative 히트 포인트
              and are losing 히트 포인트(at 1 per round, 1 per hour), you can substitute a DC 15 자기최면 check for your
              d% roll to see if you become stable. If the check is successful, you stop losing 히트 포인트(you do not
              gain any 히트 포인트, however, as a result of the check). You can substitute this check for the d% roll in
              later rounds if you are initially unsuccessful.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Resist 공포: </i><span>In response to any 공포 effect, you make a 내성 굴림 normally. If you fail 내성 굴림, you can make an
              자기최면 check on your next round even while overcome by 공포. If your 자기최면 check meets or beats the
              DC for 공포 effect, you shrug off 공포. On a failed check, 공포 affects you normally, and you gain no
              further attempts to shrug off that particular 공포 effect.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Tolerate 독: </i><span>You can choose to substitute an 자기최면 check for a 내성 굴림 against any standard 독의 secondary 피해
              or effect. This skill has no effect on the initial 내성 굴림 against 독.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Willpower: </i><span>If reduced to 0 히트 포인트(행동 불능), you can make an 자기최면 check. If successful, you can take a
              normal action while at 0 히트 포인트 without taking 1 point of 피해. You must make a check for each
              strenuous action you want to take. A failed 자기최면 check in this circumstance carries no direct
              페널티—you can choose not to take the strenuous action and thus avoid the hit point loss. If you do so
              anyway, you drop to –1 히트 포인트, as normal when 행동 불능.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Action:</b><span>
              None. Making an 자기최면 check doesn’t require an action; it is either a free action (when attempted
              reactively) or part of another action (when attempted actively).</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Try Again: </b><span>Yes, for memorize and willpower uses, though a success doesn’t cancel the effects of a previous failure.
              No for the other uses.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Synergy: </b><span>If you have 5 or more ranks in 자기최면, you get a +2 보너스 on 지식(사이오닉) checks.</span>

          <p>You are particularly good at focusing your mind.</p>
          <p>The following are additional uses for 집중 skill.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Check:</b><span>
              You must make a 집중 check whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking 피해, by harsh 날씨,
              and so on) while engaged in some action that requires your full attention. Such actions include
              manifesting a power, concentrating on an active power, directing a power, or using a psi-like
              ability.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If 집중 check succeeds, you can continue with the action as normal. If the check fails, the action
            automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of manifesting a power, 파워 포인트 are lost.
            If you were concentrating on an active power, the power ends as if you had ceased concentrating on it. If
            you were directing a power, the direction fails but the power remains active. If you were using a psi-like
            ability, that use of the ability is lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            The table below summarizes various types of distractions that cause you to make a 집중 check. If the
            distraction occurs while you are trying to manifest a power, you must add 레벨 of the power you are trying
            to manifest to the appropriate 집중 DC.

            <i>Gain 사이오닉 집중: </i><span>Merely holding a reservoir of psionic 파워 포인트 in mind gives psionic characters a special energy.
              Psionic characters can put that energy to work without actually paying a power point cost—they can become
              psionically focused as a special use of 집중 skill.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have 1 or more 파워 포인트 available, you can meditate to attempt to become psionically focused. The
            DC to become psionically focused is 20. Meditating is a full-round action that provokes 기회 공격. When you
            are psionically focused, you can expend your focus on any single 집중 check you make thereafter. When you
            expend your focus in this manner, your 집중 check is treated as if you rolled a 15. It의 like taking 10,
            except that the number you add to your 집중 수정치 is 15. You can also expend your focus to gain the benefit
            of a psionic feat—many 사이오닉 특기 are activated in this way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you are psionically focused, you remain focused until you expend your focus, become unconscious, or go
            to 수면(or enter a meditative trance, in the case of 엘란), or until your power point reserve drops to 0.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Action:</b><span>
              Usually none. In most cases, making a 집중 check doesn’t require an action; it is either a free action
              (when attempted reactively) or part of another action (when attempted actively). Meditating to gain
              사이오닉 집중 is a full-round action.</span>

            <b>Try Again:</b><span>
              Yes, though a success doesn’t cancel the effects of a previous failure, such as the loss of 파워 포인트
              for a power being manifested or the disruption of a power being concentrated on.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>특수:</b><span>
              You can use 집중 to manifest a power or use a psi-like ability defensively, so as to avoid 기회 공격
              altogether. The DC of the check is 15 + the power의 레벨. If 집중 check succeeds, you can manifest
              normally without provoking any 기회 공격. If 집중 check fails, the power also automatically fails and 파워
              포인트 are wasted, just as if your 집중 had been disrupted by a distraction.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            A character with 전투 구현 feat gets a +4 보너스 on 집중 checks made to manifest a power or use a psi-like
            ability while on the defensive or while grappling or pinned.

              You can use this skill to address a power stone (to learn what powers are encoded on it) or to activate a
              psionic item. This skill lets you use a psionic item as if you had the manifesting ability or 직업 특성 of

          </p>
          <p>
            You make 사이오닉 장치 사용하기 checks each time you activate a device such as a dorje. If you are using the

            checks once per hour.

            You must consciously choose what to emulate. That is, you must know what you are trying to emulate when you

            <i>Activate Blindly: </i><span>Some 사이오닉 아이템 are activated by special specific thoughts or conceptions. You can activate such
              items as if you were using the activation method, even if you’re not and even if you don’t know it. You do
              have to use something equivalent. You have to wave the item around or otherwise attempt to get it to

          <p>
            If you fail the check by 10 or more, you suffer brainburn. This brainburn affects you in the same way as
            brainburn that can occur when you attempt to manifest a power from a power stone, except that 피해 is 1d4
            points per power 레벨 instead of 1d6. Brainburn 피해 from activating blindly is in addition to brainburn
            피해 from manifesting a power from a power stone.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Address a Power Stone: </i><span>Successfully addressing a power stone allows you to find out what power or powers it contains. Doing this
              requires 1 minute of 집중.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Emulate an Ability Score: </i><span>To manifest a power from a power stone, you need a high ability score in the appropriate ability. Your
              effective ability score (appropriate to the class you’re emulating when you try to manifest the power from
              the power stone) is your check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the appropriate
              ability, you don’t need to make this check.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Emulate an 성향: </i><span>Some 사이오닉 아이템 have positive or negative effects based on your 성향. 사이오닉 장치 사용하기 lets
              you use these items as if you were of an 성향 of your choice. You can emulate only one 성향 at a time.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Emulate a Class Feature: </i><span>Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a psionic item. Your effective 레벨 in the emulated
              class equals your check result minus 20. This skill does not let you use the class feature of another
              class. It just lets you activate items as if you had the class feature.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If the class whose feature you are emulating has an 성향 requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or
            by emulating an appropriate 성향 as a separate check (see above).
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Emulate a Race: </i><span>Some 사이오닉 아이템 work only for certain 종족, or work better for those of certain 종족. You can use
              such an item as if you were a race of your choice. You can emulate only one race at a time.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Use a Dorje: </i><span>Normally, to use a dorje, you must have the dorje의 power on your class 파워 목록. This use of the skill
              allows you to use a dorje as if you had a particular power on your class 파워 목록. This use of the skill
              applies to other power 트리거 사이오닉 아이템, if applicable.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Use a Power Stone: </i><span>Normally, to manifest a power from a power stone, you must have the power stone의 power on your class
              파워 목록. This use of the skill allows you to use a power stone as if you had a particular power on your
              class 파워 목록. The DC is equal to 20 + 구현자 레벨 of the power you are trying to manifest from the
              power stone. <i>Note: </i>Before you use</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            a power stone, you must first have addressed it to determine what powers it contains. In addition,
            manifesting a power from a power stone requires a minimum score (10 + power 레벨) in the appropriate
            ability. If you don’t have a high enough score, you must emulate the ability score with a separate check
            (see above). This use of the skill applies to other power completion
