        Magmins are small, human-shaped beings from the Elemental Plane of Fire that radiate intense heat and are
        wreathed in an aura of searing flames. A typical magmin is 4 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.
      </p>
      <p>Magmins speak Ignan.</p>
      <section id="h2-2-combat">
        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>
          Although small, magmins are dangerous opponents. Their touch is effective against those who lack protection or
          immunity from heat and flames, but if faced with opponents who have immunity to fire, magmins rely on their
          slam attack. In any case, magmins are not valiant fighters. They usually flee if injured, although often only
          far enough to set up a fiery ambush for their enemies.
        </p>
        <p>A magmin’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>연소 (범):</strong> Anyone a magmin touches must succeed on a DC 12 Reflex save or take an extra 1d8
          points of fire damage as clothes ignite or armor becomes searing hot. The damage continues for another 1d4+2
          rounds after the magmin’s last successful attack. Magmins can also ignite flammable materials with a touch.
          The save DC is Constitution-based.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>불의 오라 (범):</strong> Anyone within 20 feet of a magmin must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or
          take 1d6 points of heat damage per round from the intense heat. The save DC is Constitution-based.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>무기 녹이기 (범):</strong> Any metal weapon that strikes a magmin must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude
          save or melt away into slag. The save DC is Constitution-based.

          A medusa tries to disguise its true nature until the intended victim is within range of its petrifying gaze,
          using subterfuge and bluffing games to convince the target that there is no danger. It uses normal weapons to

          same variety, much as though casting a <i>summon monster</i> spell, but with only a 25% chance of success.
          Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the summons that day. A mephit that has just been summoned cannot
          use its own summon ability for 1 hour. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>빠른 치료 (범):</strong> Mephits heal 2 points of damage each round, provided they are still alive and
          certain other conditions are met. See the individual descriptions for details.

            <strong>유사주문 능력:</strong> Once per hour, a magma mephit can use <i>shapechange</i> to take the form of
            a pool of lava 3 feet in diameter and 6 inches deep. The mephit’s damage reduction improves to 20/magic when
            in this form. The mephit can’t attack while in lava form but can use other spell-like abilities. It can move
            at a speed of 10 feet, but it can’t run. In this form the mephit can pass through small holes or narrow
            openings, even mere cracks. The pool’s touch ignites flammable materials such as paper, straw, or dry wood.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once per day a magma mephit can use <i>pyrotechnics</i> (DC 14). It can use itself as the fire source
            without harm. Caster level 6th. The save DC is Charisma-based.

        <p>Steam mephits come from the Elemental Plane of Fire.</p>
        <p>
          Steam mephits are bossy creatures who consider themselves the lords of all their kind. Each one is about 4
          feet tall and weighs about 2 pounds.

          <p>Unlike other mephits, steam mephits rush into combat eagerly, driven by an oversized ego.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>브레스 무기 (초):</strong> 10-foot cone of steam, damage 1d4 fire, Reflex DC 12 half. Living
            creatures that fail their saves are tormented by burned skin and seared eyes unless they have immunity to
            fire or are otherwise protected. This effect imposes a –4 penalty to AC and a –2 penalty on attack rolls for
            3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>유사주문 능력:</strong> Once per hour a steam mephit can surround itself with a plume of vapor,
            duplicating the effect of a <i>blur</i> spell (caster level 3rd). Once per day it can create a rainstorm of
            boiling water that affects a 20-foot-square area. Living creatures caught in the storm take 2d6 points of
            fire damage (Reflex DC 14 half; caster level 6th). This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. The
            save DCs are Charisma-based.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>빠른 치료 (범):</strong> A steam mephit heals only if it is touching boiling water or is in a hot,
            humid area.

        A mimic can have almost any dimensions, but usually is not more than 10 feet long. A typical mimic has a volume
        of 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet) and weighs about 4,500 pounds.
      </p>
      <p>Mimics speak Common.</p>
      <section id="h2-33-combat">
        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>
          A mimic often surprises an unsuspecting adventurer, lashing out with a heavy pseudopod. The creature does not
          necessarily fight to the death if it can succeed in extorting treasure or food from a party.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>접착 (범):</strong> A mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast any
          creatures or items that touch it. An adhesive-covered mimic automatically grapples any creature it hits with
          its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot get free while the mimic is alive without removing the adhesive
          first.
        </p>
        <p>
          A weapon that strikes an adhesive-coated mimic is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex
          save. A successful DC 16 Strength check is needed to pry it off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive, but the mimic still can grapple normally. A mimic can dissolve its
          adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies.
        </p>
        <p><strong>으깨기 (범):</strong> A mimic deals 1d8+4 points of damage with a successful grapple check.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>모방 변신 (범):</strong> A mimic can assume the general shape of any object that fills roughly 150
          cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet), such as a massive chest, a stout bed, or a wide door frame. The
          creature cannot substantially alter its size, though. A mimic’s body is hard and has a rough texture, no
          matter what appearance it might present. Anyone who examines the mimic can detect the ruse with a successful
          Spot check opposed by the mimic’s Disguise check. Of course, by this time it is generally far too late.
        </p>
        <p><strong>스킬:</strong> A mimic has a +8 racial bonus on Disguise checks.</p>

          <strong>강한 돌격 (범):</strong> A minotaur typically begins a battle by charging at an opponent, lowering its
          head to bring its mighty horns into play. In addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a charge, this

          <strong>선척적 교활함 (범):</strong> Although minotaurs are not especially intelligent, they possess innate
          cunning and logical ability. This gives them immunity to <i>maze</i> spells, prevents them from ever becoming
          lost, and enables them to track enemies. Further, they are never caught flat-footed.

        Mohrgs are the animated corpses of mass murderers or similar villains who died without atoning for their crimes.

        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>
          Like zombies, mohrgs attack by slamming enemies with their fists. They often catch opponents flat-footed, for
          they move much faster than zombies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>향상된 잡아채기 (범):</strong> To use this ability, a mohrg must hit a creature of its size or smaller
          with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
          opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>마비의 손길 (초):</strong> A mohrg lashes out with its tongue in combat. An opponent the tongue
          touches must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or become paralyzed for 1d4 minutes. The save DC is
          Charisma-based. <b>Create Spawn (Su):</b> Creatures killed by a mohrg rise after 1d4 days as zombies under the
          morhg’s control. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

      <p>Mummies are preserved corpses animated through the auspices of dark desert gods best forgotten.</p>
      <p>Most mummies are 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh about 120 pounds.</p>

          <strong>절망 (초):</strong> At the mere sight of a mummy, the viewer must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or be
          paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected
          again by the same mummy’s despair ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>미라썩음증 (초):</strong> Supernatural disease—slam, Fortitude DC 16, incubation period 1 minute;
          damage 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha. The save DC is Charisma-based.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike normal diseases, mummy rot continues until the victim reaches Constitution 0 (and dies) or is cured as
          described below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mummy rot is a powerful curse, not a natural disease. A character attempting to cast any conjuration (healing)
          spell on a creature afflicted with mummy rot must succeed on a DC 20 caster level check, or the spell has no
          effect on the afflicted character.
        </p>
        <p>
          To eliminate mummy rot, the curse must first be broken with <i>break enchantment</i> or
          <i>remove curse</i> (requiring a DC 20 caster level check for either spell), after which a caster level check
          is no longer necessary to cast healing spells on the victim, and the mummy rot can be magically cured as any
          normal disease.
        </p>
        <p>
          An afflicted creature who dies of mummy rot shrivels away into sand and dust that blow away into nothing at
          the first wind.

        <h2>미라 군주</h2>
        <p>
          Unusually powerful or evil individuals preserved as mummies sometimes rise as greater mummies after death. A
          mummy lord resembles its lesser fellows, but often wears or carries equipment it used in life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mummy lords are often potent spellcasters. They are found as guardians of the tombs of high lords, priests,
          and mages. Most are sworn to defend for eternity the resting place of those whom they served in life, but in
          some cases a mummy lord’s unliving state is the result of a terrible curse or rite designed to punish treason,
          infidelity, or crimes of an even more abhorrent nature. A mummy lord of this sort is usually imprisoned in a
          tomb that is never meant to be opened again.

        All nagas have long, snakelike bodies covered with glistening scales, and more or less human faces. They range
        in length from 10 to 20 feet and weigh from 200 to 500 pounds. The eyes of a naga are bright and intelligent,
        burning with an almost hypnotic inner light.

        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>
          Nagas favor spells over other forms of combat. Because they are almost always found in the lairs they guard
          and know well, they can arrange most encounters to suit their wishes.

          <p>
            Guardian nagas usually warn off intruders before attacking. If the warning is ignored, they may begin a
            spell assault or spit poison.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>독 (범):</strong> Injury or contact, Fortitude DC 19, initial and secondary damage 1d10 Con. The
            save DC is Constitution-based.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>침뱉기 (범):</strong> A guardian naga can spit its venom up to 30 feet as a standard action. This is
            a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Opponents hit by this attack must make successful saves (see
            above) to avoid the effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>주문:</strong> Guardian nagas cast spells as 9th-level sorcerers, and can also cast spells from the
            cleric list and from the Good and Law domains. The cleric spells and domain spells are considered arcane
            spells for a guardian naga, meaning that the creature does not need a divine focus to cast them.

        <p>Night hags attack good creatures on sight if the odds of success seem favorable.</p>

          These creatures rip through armor and flesh with their deadly teeth. They love to use <i>sleep</i> and then

          A night hag’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose
          of overcoming damage reduction. Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming
          damage reduction.

          <strong>꿈 속 출몰 (초):</strong> Night hags can visit the dreams of chaotic or evil individuals by using a
          special periapt known as a <i>heartstone</i> to become ethereal, then hovering over the creature. Once a hag
          invades someone’s dreams, it rides on the victim’s back until dawn. The sleeper suffers from tormenting dreams
          and takes 1 point of Constitution drain upon awakening. Only another ethereal being can stop these nocturnal
          intrusions, by confronting and defeating the night hag.

        <p>
          All night hags carry a periapt known as a <i>heartstone,</i> which instantly cures any disease contracted by
          the holder. In addition, a <i>heartstone</i> provides a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws (this bonus
          is included in the statistics block). A night hag that loses this charm can no longer use
          <i>etherealness</i> until it can manufacture another (which takes one month). Creatures other than the hag can
          benefit from the <i>heartstone</i>’s powers, but the periapt shatters after ten uses (any disease cured or
          saving throw affected
        </p>
        <p>
          counts as a use) and it does not bestow <i>etherealness</i> to a bearer that is not a night hag. If sold, an

        <p>
          <strong>연막 (초):</strong> During the excitement of battle, a nightmare snorts and neighs with rage. This
          snorting fills a 15-foot cone with a hot, sulfurous smoke that chokes and blinds opponents. Anyone in the cone
          must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take a –2 penalty on all attack and damage rolls until 1d6 minutes
          after leaving the cone. The cone lasts 1 round, and the nightmare uses it once as a free action during its
          turn each round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of the smoke it gives off, a nightmare has concealment against creatures 5 feet away and total
          concealment against creatures 10 feet or farther away. The smoke does not obscure the nightmare’s vision at
          all.

      <h1>밤그늘</h1>
      <p>Nightshades are powerful undead composed of equal parts darkness and absolute evil.</p>
      <p>
        Nightshades can read and understand all forms of communication; however, they communicate with others by
        telepathy.
      </p>
      <section id="h2-60-combat">
        <h2>전투</h2>
        <p>
          Each of the three known varieties of nightshade is a terrible creature with unique powers and abilities. Their
          tactics vary according to their abilities, but they all make liberal use of <i>haste</i>.
        </p>
        <section id="h4-61-nightshade-abilities">
          <h4>밤그늘 능력</h4>
          <p>All nightshades have the following special abilities.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>햇살 혐오 (범):</strong> If exposed to natural daylight (not merely a <i>daylight</i> spell),
            nightshades take a –4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>더럽힘 오라 (초):</strong> All nightshades give off a 20-footradius emanation of utter desecration,
            imbuing their surroundings with negative energy. This ability works much like a <i>desecrate</i> spell,
            except that the nightshade’s evil is so great that it is treated as the shrine of an evil power. All undead
            within 20 feet of the nightshade (including the creature itself ) gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls,
            damage rolls, and saving throws, and +2 hit points per HD. (The nightshade Hit Dice, attack, and save
            entries given here include these profane bonuses.) Charisma checks made to turn undead within this area take
            a –6 penalty.
          </p>
          <p>
            A nightshade’s desecrating aura cannot be dispelled except by a <i>dispel evil</i> spell or similar effect.
            If the effect is dispelled, the nightshade can resume it as a free action on its next turn. Its desecrating
            aura is suppressed if a nightshade enters a <i>consecrated</i> or <i>hallowed</i> area, but the nightshade’s
            presence also suppresses the <i>consecrated</i> or <i>hallowed</i> effect for as long as it remains in the
            area.

        <p>A nightcrawler is a massive behemoth similar to a purple worm, though utterly black in color.</p>
        <p>
          A nightcrawler measures about 7 feet in diameter and is 100 feet long from its toothy maw to the tip of its
          stinging tail. It weighs about 55,000 pounds.
        </p>
        <section id="h4-63-combat">
          <h4>전투</h4>
          <p>A nightcrawler attacks by burrowing through the ground and emerging to strike.</p>
          <p>
            A nightcrawler’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage
            reduction.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>에너지 흡수 (초):</strong> Living creatures inside a nightcrawler’s gizzard gain one negative level
            each round. The DC is 26 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based.
          </p>
          <p>For each such negative level bestowed, the nightcrawler gains 5 temporary hit points.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>향상된 잡아채기 (범):</strong> To use this ability, a nightcrawler must hit with its bite attack. It
            can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins
            the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the opponent in the following round.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>독 (범):</strong> Injury, Fortitude DC 22, initial and secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is
            Constitution-based.

            <strong>유사주문 능력:</strong> At will—<i>contagion</i> (DC 18),

              >finger of death</i
            >
            (DC 21), <i>mass hold monster</i> (DC 23), <i>plane shift</i> (DC 21). Caster level 25th. The save DCs are
            Charisma-based.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>언데드 소환 (초):</strong> A nightcrawler can summon undead creatures once per night: 9–16 shadows,
            3–6 greater shadows, or 2–4 dread wraiths. The undead arrive in 1d10 rounds and serve for 1 hour or until
            released.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>집어 삼키기 (범):</strong> A nightcrawler can try to swallow a grabbed opponent of Huge or smaller
            size by making a successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning
            damage plus 12 points of acid damage per round from the nightcrawler’s gizzard and is subject to the
            creature’s energy drain. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing
            weapon to deal 35 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 21). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes
            the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A nightcrawler’s interior can hold 2 Huge, 8
            Large, 32 Medium, 128 Small, 512 Tiny or smaller opponents.

            A nightwalker’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>아이템 으깨기 (초):</strong> A nightwalker can destroy any weapon or item of Large size or smaller
            (even magic ones, but not artifacts) by picking it up and crushing it between its hands. The nightwalker
            must make a successful disarm attempt to grab an item held by an opponent. The item is entitled to a DC 34
            Fortitude save to resist destruction. The save DC is Strength-based.

            DC 24 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d8 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that
            creature cannot be affected again by the same nightshade’s gaze for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear

            The nightwalker is an exceedingly intelligent foe that makes the best use of all its abilities. It favors

        <p>Nightwings are batlike flyers that hunt on the wing.</p>
        <p>A nightwing has a wingspan of about 40 feet and weighs about 4,000 pounds.</p>
        <section id="h4-68-combat">
          <h4>전투</h4>
          <p>
            Nightwings prowl the night sky and dive onto their victims. They are all but invisible, detectable only
            because of the stars they obscure in their passing.
          </p>
          <p>
            A nightwing’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>마법 흡수 (초):</strong> A nightwing can weaken magic armor, weapons, and shields by making a
            successful touch attack. The targeted item must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or lose 1 point of its
            enhancement bonus. The save DC is Charisma-based. An item that loses its entire enhancement bonus becomes
            merely a masterwork item and loses any special abilities (such as flaming) as well. Casting
            <i>dispel evil</i> upon the item reverses the effect of the magic drain, provided this occurs within a
            number of days after the attack equal to the caster’s level and the caster succeeds on a DC 29 caster level
            check.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>유사주문 능력:</strong> At will—<i>contagion</i> (DC 18),
            <i>deeper darkness, detect magic, haste, see invisibility, unholy blight</i> (DC 18); 3/day—<i>confusion</i>
            (DC 18), <i>greater dispel magic, hold monster</i> (DC 19), <i>invisibility;</i> 1/day—<i>cone of cold</i>
            (DC 19), <i>finger of death</i> (DC 21), <i>plane shift</i> (DC 21). Caster level 17th. The save DCs are
            Charisma-based.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>언데드 소환 (초):</strong> A nightwing can summon undead creatures once per night: 5–12 shadows, 2–4
            greater shadows, or 1 dread wraith. The undead arrive in 1d10 rounds and serve for 1 hour or until released.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>스킬:</strong> *When hiding in a dark area or flying in a dark sky, a nightwing gains a +8 racial
            bonus on Hide checks.

          <strong>실명시키는 아름다움 (초):</strong> This ability affects all humanoids within 30 feet of a nymph. Those
          who look directly at a nymph must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be blinded permanently as though by the
          <i>blindness</i> spell. A nymph can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.

          <strong>기절시키는 곁눈질 (초):</strong> As a standard action, a wrathful nymph can stun a creature within 30
          feet with a look. The target creature must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be stunned for 2d4 rounds. The
          save DC is Charisma-based.

          <strong>섬뜩한 우아함 (초):</strong> A nymph adds her Charisma modifier as a bonus on all her saving throws,
          and as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class. (The statistics block already reflects these bonuses).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>야생 교감 (범):</strong> This power works like the druid’s wild empathy class feature, except that a
          nymph has a +6 racial bonus on the check.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>스킬:</strong> A nymph has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid
          a hazard. She can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. She can use the
          run action while swimming, provided she swims in a straight line.
