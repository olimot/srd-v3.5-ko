        <p>
          Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round thereafter, you may call down a 5-foot-wide,
          30-foot-long, vertical 화살 of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity 피해. 화살 of lightning
          flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever target point you choose within the spell의 거리 (measured from
          your position at the time). Any creature in the target square or in the path of 화살 is affected.
        </p>
        <p>
          You need not call a 화살 of lightning immediately; other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed.
          However, each round after the first you may use a standard action (concentrating on the spell) to call a
          화살. You may call a total number of 화살 equal to your 시전자 레벨(maximum 10 화살).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are outdoors and in a stormy 범위—a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy 상태이상, or even a
          tornado (including a 훨윈드 formed by a 지니 or an 공기 정령 of at least Large size)—each 화살 deals 3d10
          points of electricity 피해 instead of 3d6.

        <p>This spell functions indoors or underground but not underwater.</p>

        <p>
          This spell soothes and quiets animals, rendering them docile and harmless. Only ordinary animals (those with
          지능 scores of 1 or 2) can be affected by this spell. All the subjects must be of the same kind, and no two
          may be more than 30 feet apart. The maximum number of 히트 다이스 of animals you can affect is equal to 2d4 +
          시전자 레벨. A 흉폭한 동물 or an animal trained to 공격 or guard is allowed a 내성 굴림; other animals are
          not.
        </p>
        <p>
          The affected creatures remain where they are and do not 공격 or flee. They are not helpless and defend
          themselves normally if attacked. Any threat breaks the spell on the threatened creatures.

        <p>
          This spell calms agitated creatures. You have no control over the affected creatures, but
          <i>평온한 감정 </i>can stop raging creatures from fighting or joyous ones
          from reveling. Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do
          anything destructive. Any aggressive action against or 피해 dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the
          spell on all calmed creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any 의욕 보너스 granted by 주문 such as
          <i>축복, 희망, </i>and <i>격노, </i>as well
          as negating a 음유시인의 ability to inspire courage or 바바리안의 격노 ability. It also suppresses any 공포
          effects and removes the <i>confused </i>condition from all targets<i>. </i>While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell or effect has no effect. When the
          <i>평온한 감정 </i>spell ends, the original spell or effect takes hold of the
          creature again, provided that its 지속시간 has not expired in the meantime.

          The transmuted creature becomes more graceful, 재빠름, and coordinated. The spell grants a +4 enhancement

          This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from your fingertips.
          Unlike <i>번개 화살</i>,
          <i>사슬 번개 </i>strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other
          targets.
        </p>
        <p>
          화살 deals 1d6 points of electricity 피해 per 시전자 레벨(maximum 20d6) to the primary target. After it
          strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your 시전자 레벨(maximum 20). The
          secondary 화살 each strike one target and deal half as much 피해 as the primary one did (rounded down).
        </p>
        <p>
          Each target can attempt a Reflex 내성 굴림 for half 피해. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they
          must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose
          to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.

          You change a specially prepared 육척봉 into a Huge treantlike creature, about 24 feet tall. When you
          plant the end of the staff in the ground and 말하기 a special 명령 to conclude the casting of the spell, your
          staff turns into a creature that looks and fights just like a 나무정령. The staff-나무정령 defends you and
          obeys any spoken 명령. However, it is by no means a true 나무정령; it cannot converse with actual 나무정령 or
          control trees. If the staff-나무정령 is reduced to 0 or fewer 히트 포인트, it crumbles to powder and the staff
          is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell 지속시간 expires (or when the
          spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-나무정령 is
          always at full 근력 when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.

          You unleash chaotic power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a multicolored explosion of

        </p>
        <p>
          The spell deals 1d8 points of 피해 per two 시전자 레벨(maximum 5d8) to lawful creatures (or 1d6 points of 피해
          per 시전자 레벨, maximum 10d6, to lawful outsiders) and slow them for 1d6 rounds (see the

          This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target의 attitude as
          friendly). If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it
          receives a +5 보너스 on its 내성 굴림.

        <p>
          The spell does not enable you to control the <i>charmed </i>person as if it
          were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the
          subject orders, but you must win an opposed 매력 check to convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily
          do. (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it
          might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.&nbsp; Any act by you or your apparent allies
          that threatens the <i>charmed </i>person breaks the spell. You must 말하기
          the person의 language to communicate your 명령, or else be good at pantomiming.

          <i>한기 어린 금속 </i><span>makes metal extremely cold. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no 내성 굴림. Magical metal is allowed a 내성

          This spell functions like <i>가로막는 손, </i>except that the hand can
          interpose itself, push, or strike one opponent that you select. The floating hand can 이동 as far as 60 feet
          and can 공격 in the same round. Since this hand is directed by you, its ability to notice or 공격 invisible or

        <p>
          The hand 공격 once per round, and its 공격 보너스 equals your 시전자 레벨 + your 지능, 지혜, or 매력 수정치
          (for a 마법사, 사제, or 소서러, respectively), +11 for the hand의 근력 score (33), –1 for being Large. The

        </p>
        <p>
          First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection 보너스 to AC and a +4 저항 보너스 on 내성 굴림. Unlike

          not just against 공격 by lawful creatures.

        <p>Second, each warded creature gains 주문 저항 25 against lawful 주문 and 주문 cast by lawful creatures.</p>
        <p>
          Third, 회피술 blocks possession and mental influence, just as
          <i>질서 방어 마법 </i>does.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, if a lawful creature succeeds on a melee 공격 against a warded creature, the offending attacker is
          <i>confused </i>for 1 round (Will save negates, as with the
          <i>혼란 </i>spell, but against the save DC of

          This spell makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the original individual has been slain, its soul
          immediately transfers to 복제, creating a replacement (provided that the soul is free and willing to return).
          The original의 physical remains, should they still exist, become inert and cannot thereafter be restored to
          life. If the original creature has reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has died of natural
          causes), any cloning attempt fails.
        </p>
        <p>
          To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume
          of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature의 living body. The piece of flesh need not
          be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting. Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a
          laboratory for 2d4 months.
        </p>
        <p>
          When 복제 is completed, the original의 soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already 죽음. The 복제
          is physically identical with the original and possesses the same personality and memories as the original. In
          other respects, treat 복제 as if it were the original character raised from 죽음, including the loss of one
          레벨 or 2 points of 건강(if the original was a 1st-레벨 character). If this 건강 adjustment would give 복제 a
          건강 score of 0, the spell fails. If the original creature has lost 레벨 since the flesh sample was taken and
          died at a lower 레벨 than 복제 would otherwise be, 복제 is one 레벨 below 레벨 at which the original died.
        </p>
        <p>The spell duplicates only the original의 body and mind, not its 장비.</p>
        <p>
          A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is unavailable, but the
          resulting body is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh, which rots if not preserved.

          that its vapors are yellowish green and poisonous. These vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3

          A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of 건강 피해 on your turn each round while in the cloud

          Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest 레벨 of the land, even pouring down den or

          understand you, and they perceive your words and actions in the most favorable way (treat their attitude as
          friendly). They will not 공격 you while the spell lasts. You can try to give a subject orders, but you must

          This spell allows you some degree of control over an undead creature. Assuming the subject is intelligent, it
          perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way (treat its attitude as friendly). It will not 공격
          you while the spell lasts. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed 매력 check to
          convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An intelligent commanded
          undead never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very
          dangerous is worth doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          A nonintelligent undead creature gets no 내성 굴림 against this spell. When you control a mindless being, you
          can communicate only basic 명령, such as “come here,” “go there,” “fight,” “부동 기립,” and so on.
          Nonintelligent undead won’t resist suicidal or obviously harmful orders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the commanded undead (regardless of its 지능) breaks the
          spell.
        </p>
        <p>Your 명령 are not telepathic. The undead creature must be able to hear you.</p>

          You contact your deity—or agents thereof —and ask questions that can be answered by a simple yes or no. (A

          시전자 레벨. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity의 지식. “Unclear” is a legitimate
          answer, because powerful beings of the Outer 이세계 are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word

          You become one with nature, attaining 지식 of the surrounding territory. You instantly gain 지식 of as many as
          three facts from among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water,
          people, general animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures,

          function where nature has been replaced by 제작 or settlement, such as in 던전 and towns.

          You can understand the spoken words of creatures or read otherwise incomprehensible written 통보. In either

          This spell 축복 an 범위 with positive energy. Each 매력 check made to 언데드 퇴치 within this 범위 gains a +3
          sacred 보너스. Every undead creature entering a <i>consecrated </i>범위

          If the <i>consecrated </i>범위 contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent

        </p>
        <p>
          You must concentrate on maintaining the spell (a standard action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one
          per round. A question is answered by the power during the same round. For every two 시전자 레벨, you may ask
          one question.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease
          to 지능 and 매력, but the chance of the power knowing the answer, as well as the probability of the entity
          answering correctly, are likewise increased by moving to distant 이세계.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the Outer 이세계 are reached, the power of the deity contacted determines the effects. (Random results
          obtained from the table are subject to the personalities of individual deities.)

        <p>
          You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate
          when casting <i>비상사태</i>. The
          <i>비상사태 </i>spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The
          10-minute 시전 시간 is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a 시전 시간 longer than
          10 minutes, use that instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          The spell to be brought into effect by the <i>비상사태 </i>must be one that
          affects your person and be of a spell 레벨 no higher than one-third your 시전자 레벨(rounded down, maximum 6th
          레벨).
        </p>
        <p>
          상태이상 needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the
          <i>비상사태 </i>immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the
          latter being “cast” instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted
          상태이상 are prescribed, the whole spell combination (<i>비상사태 </i>and the
          companion magic) may fail when called on. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated 상태이상,
          regardless of whether you want it to.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use only one <i>비상사태 </i>spell at a time; if a second is cast,
          the first one (if still active) is dispelled.
        </p>

        <p>
          When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 1d8 points of 피해 +1

        <p>
          Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals 피해 to them instead of curing their wounds. An
          undead creature can apply 주문 저항, and can attempt a Will save to take half 피해.
