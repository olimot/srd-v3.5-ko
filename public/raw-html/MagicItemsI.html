      <p>
        마법 아이템 are divided into categories: 갑옷, 무기, potions, 반지, 마법봉, 두루마리, 마법지팡이, 마법막대, and
        고급 아이템. In addition, some 마법 아이템 are cursed or intelligent. Finally, a few 마법 아이템 are of such
        rarity and power that they are considered to belong to a category of their own: 유물. 유물 are classified in
        turn as minor (extremely rare but not one-of-a-kind items) or major (each one unique and extremely potent).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>갑옷 및 방패:</b><span>
          Magic 갑옷(including 방패) offers improved, magical protection to the wearer. Some of these items confer 능력
          beyond a benefit to 방어도.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>무기:</b><span>
          마법 무기 are created with a variety of 전투 powers and almost always improve 공격 and 피해 rolls of the
          wielder as well.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Potions:</b><span> A potion is an elixir concocted with a spell-like effect that affects only the drinker.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>반지:</b><span>
          A ring is a circular metal band worn on the finger (no more than two 반지 per wearer) that has a spell-like
          power (often a constant effect that affects the wearer).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>마법봉: </b><span>A rod is a scepter-like item with a special power unlike that of any known spell.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>두루마리:</b><span> A scroll is a spell magically inscribed onto paper or parchment so that it can be used later.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>마법지팡이:</b><span>
          A staff has a number of different (but often related) spell effects. A newly created staff has 50 돌격, and
          each use of the staff depletes one or more of those 돌격.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>마법막대:</b><span>
          A wand is a short stick imbued with the power to cast a specific spell. A newly created wand has 50 돌격, and
          each use of the wand depletes one of those 돌격.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>고급 아이템:</b><span> These objects include magic jewelry, tools, books, 의류, and much more.</span>

        <p>
          When <i>마법 감지 </i>identifies a magic item’s 학파 of magic, this
          information refers to 학파 of the spell placed within the potion, scroll, or wand, or the prerequisite given
          for the item. 묘사 of each item provides its aura 근력 and 학파 it belongs to.
        </p>
        <p>
          If more than one spell is given as a prerequisite, use the highest-레벨 spell. If no 주문 are included in the
          전제조건, use the following default guidelines.

        <h3>아이템 사용</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">USING ITEMS</div>
        <p>
          To use a magic item, it must be activated, although sometimes activation simply means putting a ring on your
          finger. Some items, once donned, function constantly. In most cases, using an item requires a standard action
          that does not provoke 기회 공격. By contrast, spell completion items are treated like 주문 in 전투 and do
          provoke 기회 공격.
        </p>
        <p>
          Activating a magic item is a standard action unless the item 묘사 indicates otherwise. However, 시전 시간 of a
          spell is the time required to activate the same power in an item, regardless of the type of magic item, unless
          the item 묘사 specifically states otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>The four ways to 마법 아이템 사용 are described below.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Spell Completion:</b><span>
            This is the activation method for 두루마리. A scroll is a spell that is mostly finished. The preparation is
            done for the caster, so no preparation time is needed beforehand as with normal spellcasting. All that’s
            left to do is 공연 the finishing parts of the spellcasting (the final gestures, words, and so on). To use a
            spell completion item safely, a character must be of high enough 레벨 in the right class to cast the spell
            already. If he can’t already cast the spell, there’s a chance he’ll make a mistake. Activating a spell
            completion item is a standard action and provokes 기회 공격 exactly as casting a spell does.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Spell 트리거:</b><span>
            Spell 트리거 activation is similar to spell completion, but it’s even simpler. No gestures or spell
            finishing is needed, just a special 지식 of spellcasting that an appropriate character would know, and a
            single word that must be spoken. Anyone with a spell on his or her spell list knows how to use a spell
            트리거 item that stores that spell. (This is the case even for a character who can’t actually cast 주문,
            such as a 3rd-레벨 성기사.) The user must still determine what spell is stored in the item before she can
            activate it. Activating a spell 트리거 item is a standard action and does not provoke 기회 공격.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>명령 Word: </b><span>If no activation method is suggested either in the magic item 묘사 or by the nature of the item, assume
            that a 명령 word is needed to activate it. 명령 word activation means that a character 말하기 the word and
            the item activates. No other special 지식 is needed.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          A 명령 word can be a real word, but when this is the case, the holder of the item 달리기 the risk of
          activating the item accidentally by speaking the word in normal conversation. More often, 명령 word is some
          seemingly nonsensical word, or a word or phrase from an ancient language no longer in common use. Activating a
          명령 word magic item is a standard action and does not provoke 기회 공격.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes 명령 word to activate an item is written right on the item. Occasionally, it might be hidden within
          a pattern or design engraved on, carved into, or built into the item, or the item might bear a clue to 명령
          word.
        </p>
        <p>
          지식(arcana) and 지식(history) 스킬 might be useful in helping to 식별 명령 words or deciphering clues
          regarding them. A successful check against DC 30 is needed to come up with the word itself. If that check is
          failed, succeeding on a second check (DC 25) might provide some insight into a clue.
        </p>
        <p>
          주문 <i>식별 </i>and <i>드웨머 분석 </i>both
          reveal 명령 words.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Use Activated:</b><span>
            This type of item simply has to be used in order to activate it. A character has to drink a potion, swing a
            sword, interpose a 방패 to deflect a blow in 전투, look through a lens, sprinkle dust, wear a ring, or don a
            hat. Use activation is generally straightforward and self-explanatory.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears. Continually functioning items are practically
          always items that one wears. A few must simply be in the character’s possession (on his person). However, some
          items made for wearingmust still be activated. Although this activation sometimes requires a 명령 word (see
          above), usually it means mentally willing the activation to happen. 묘사 of an item states whether a 명령 word
          is needed in such a case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated magic item is either a standard action or not an action at
          all and does not provoke 기회 공격, unless the use involves performing an action that provokes an 공격 of
          opportunity in itself. If the use of the item takes time before a magical effect occurs, then use activation
          is a standard action. If the item’s activation is subsumed in its use and takes no extra time use activation
          is not an action at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use activation doesn’t mean that if you use an item, you automatically know what it can do. You must know (or
          at least guess) what the item can do and then use the item in order to activate it, unless the benefit of the
          item comes automatically, such from drinking a potion or swinging a sword.

        <div class="original-headline">SIZE AND MAGIC ITEMS</div>
        <p>
          When an article of magic 의류 or jewelry is discovered, most of the time size shouldn’t be an issue. Many
          magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they adjust themselves magically to the wearer. Size
          should not keep characters of various kinds from using 마법 아이템.

        <p>
          <b>갑옷 and Weapon Sizes: </b><span>갑옷 and 무기 that are found at random have a 30% chance of being Small (01–30), a 60% chance of being

        <h3>착용 가능한 마법 아이템</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">MAGIC ITEMS ON THE BODY</div>
        <p>
          Many 마법 아이템 need to be donned by a character who wants to employ them or benefit from their 능력. It’s
          possible for a creature with a humanoid-shaped body to wear as many as twelve 마법 아이템 at the same time.
          However, each of those items must be worn on (or over) a particular part of the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          A humanoid-shaped body can be decked out in magic gear consisting of one item from each of the following
          groups, keyed to which place on the body the item is worn.
        </p>
        <p>• One headband, hat, helmet, or phylactery on the head</p>
        <p>• One pair of eye lenses or goggles on or over the eyes</p>
        <p>• One 아뮬렛, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab around the neck</p>
        <p>• One vest, vestment, or shirt on the torso</p>
        <p>• One robe or suit of 갑옷 on the body (over a vest, vestment, or shirt)</p>
        <p>• One belt around the waist (over a robe or suit of 갑옷)</p>
        <p>• One cloak, cape, or mantle around the shoulders (over a robe or suit of 갑옷)</p>
        <p>• One pair of bracers or bracelets on the arms or wrists</p>
        <p>• One glove, pair of gloves, or pair of gauntlets on the hands</p>
        <p>• One ring on each hand (or two 반지 on one hand)</p>
        <p>• One pair of boots or shoes on the feet</p>
        <p>
          Of course, a character may carry or possess as many items of the same type as he 소원. However, additional
          items beyond those listed above have no effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some itemscan be worn or carried without taking up space on a character’s body. 묘사 of an item indicates when
          an item has this property.

        <h3>마법 아이템이 가진 힘에 대한 내성 굴림</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">SAVING THROWS AGAINST MAGIC ITEM POWERS</div>
        <p>
          마법 아이템 produce 주문 or spell-like effects. For a 내성 굴림 against a spell or spell-like effect from a
          magic item, the DC is 10 + 레벨 of the spell or effect + the ability 수정치 of the minimum ability score
          needed to cast that 레벨 of spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          마법지팡이 are an exception to the rule. Treat 내성 굴림 as if the wielder cast the spell, including 시전자
          레벨 and all 수정치 to save DC.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most item 묘사 give 내성 굴림 DCs for various effects, particularly when the effect has no exact spell
          equivalent (making its 레벨 otherwise difficult to determine quickly).
        </p>

        <h3>마법 아이템의 피해</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">DAMAGING MAGIC ITEMS</div>
        <p>
          A magic item doesn’t need to make a 내성 굴림 unless it is unattended, it is specifically targeted by the
          effect, or its wielder rolls a natural 1 on his save. 마법 아이템 should always get a 내성 굴림 against 주문
          that might deal 피해 to them— even against 공격 from which a nonmagical item would normally get no chance to
          save. 마법 아이템 use the same 내성 굴림 보너스 for all 내성 굴림, no matter what the type (Fortitude, Reflex,
          or Will). A magic item’s 내성 굴림 보너스 equals 2 + one-half its 시전자 레벨(round down). The only exceptions
          to this are intelligent 마법 아이템, which make Will 내성 굴림 based on their own 지혜 scores.
        </p>
        <p>
          마법 아이템, unless otherwise noted, take 피해 as nonmagical items of the same sort. A damaged magic item
          continues to function, but if it is destroyed, all its magical power is lost.

        <p>
          Some 마법 아이템 take 피해 over the course of an adventure. It costs no more to repair a magic item with the
          제작 skill than it does to repair its nonmagical counterpart. The
          <i>완전 수리 </i>spell also repairs a damaged—but not completely broken—magic
          item.

        <div class="original-headline">INTELLIGENT ITEMS</div>
        <p>
          Some 마법 아이템, particularly 무기, have an 지능 all their own. Only permanent 마법 아이템(as opposed to
          those with a single use or those with 돌격) can be intelligent. (This means that potions, 두루마리, and
          마법막대, among other items, are never intelligent.)

          Some items are cursed—incorrectly made, or corrupted by outside forces. 저주 받은 아이템 might be particularly
          dangerous to the user, or they might be normal items with a minor flaw, an inconvenient requirement, or an
          unpredictable nature. Randomly generated items are cursed 5% of the time.

        <p>
          Many items, particularly 마법막대 and 마법지팡이, are limited in power by the number of 돌격 they hold.
          Normally, charged items have 50 돌격 at most. If such an item is found as a random part of a 전리품, roll d%
          and divide by 2 to determine the number of 돌격 left (round down, minimum 1). If the item has a maximum number
          of 돌격 other than 50, roll randomly to determine how many 돌격 are left.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prices listed are always for fully charged items. (When an item is created, it is fully charged.) For an item
          that’s worthless when its 돌격 달리기 out (which is the case for almost all charged items), the value of the
          partially used item is proportional to the number of 돌격 left. For an item that has usefulness in addition to
          its 돌격, only part of the item’s value is based on the number of 돌격 left.

        <h2>마법 아이템 설명</h2>
        <div class="original-headline">MAGIC ITEM DESCRIPTIONS</div>
        <p>Each general type of magic item gets an overall 묘사, followed by 묘사 of specific items.</p>
        <p>
          General 묘사 include notes on activation, random generation, and other material. The AC, hardness, 히트
          포인트, and break DC are given for typical examples of some 마법 아이템. The AC assumes that the item is
          unattended and includes a –5 페널티 for the item’s effective 민첩 of 0. If a creature holds the item, use the
          creature’s 민첩 수정치 in place of the –5 페널티.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some individual items, notably those that simply store 주문 and nothing else, don’t get full-blown 묘사.
          Reference the spell’s 묘사 for details, modified by the form of the item (potion, scroll, wand, and so on).
          Assume that the spell is cast at the minimum 레벨 required to cast it
        </p>
        <p>
          Items with full 묘사 have their powers detailed, and each of the following topics is covered in notational
          form at the end of 묘사.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Aura: Most of the time, a <i>마법 감지 </i>spell will reveal 학파 of magic
          associated with a magic item and 근력 of the aura an item emits. This information (when applicable) is given
          at the beginning of the item’s notational entry. See the
          <i>마법 감지 </i>spell descriptionfor details.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>• </i><span>시전자 레벨: The next item in a notational entry gives 시전자 레벨 of the item, indicating its relative
            power. 시전자 레벨 determines the item’s 내성 굴림 보너스, as well as 거리 or other 레벨-dependent aspects
            of the powers of the item (if variable). It also determines 레벨 that must be contended with should the item
            come under the effect of a <i>마법 무효화 </i>spell or similar situation.
            This information is given in the form “CL x,” where “CL” is an abbreviation for 시전자 레벨 and “x” is an
            ordinal number representing 시전자 레벨 itself.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          For potions, 두루마리, and 마법막대, the creator can set 시전자 레벨 of an item at any number high enough to
          cast the stored spell and not higher than her own 시전자 레벨. For other 마법 아이템, 시전자 레벨 is
          determined by the item itself. In this case, the creator’s 시전자 레벨 must be as high as the item’s 시전자
          레벨(and 전제조건 may effectively put a higher minimum on the creator’s 레벨).
        </p>
        <p>
          • 전제조건: Certain 필요조건 must be met in order for a character to create a magic item. These include 특기,
          주문, and 기타 필요조건 such as 레벨, 성향, and race or kind. 전제조건 for creation of an item are given
          immediately following the item’s 시전자 레벨.
        </p>
        <p>
          A spell prerequisite may be provided by a character who has prepared the spell (or who knows the spell, in the
          case of a 소서러 or 음유시인), or through the use of a spell completion or spell 트리거 magic item or a
          spell-like ability that produces the desired spell effect. For each day that passes in the creation process,
          the creator must expend one spell completion item or one 돌격 from a spell 트리거 item if either of those
          objects is used to supply a prerequisite.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the creation of an item, with each participant
          providing one or more of 전제조건. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they must agree among themselves who will be considered
          the creator for 목적 of determinations where the creator’s 레벨 must be known. The character designated as the
          creator pays the XP required to make the item.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typically, a list of 전제조건 includes one feat and one or more 주문(or some other requirement in addition to
          the feat).
        </p>
        <p>
          When two 주문 at the end of a list are separated by “or,” one of those 주문 is required in addition to every
          other spell mentioned prior to the last two.
        </p>
        <p>
          • 시장 가격: This gold piece value, given following the word “Price,” represents the price someone should
          expect to pay to buy the item. 시장 가격 for an item that can be constructed with an item creation feat is
          usually equal to the base price plus the price for any 구성요소(material or XP).
        </p>
        <p>
          • Cost to Create: The next part of a notational entry is the cost in gp and XP to create the item, given
          following the word
        </p>
        <p>
          “Cost.” This information appears only for items with 구성요소(material or XP), which make their 시장 가격
          higher than their base prices. The cost to create includes the costs derived from the base cost plus the costs
          of 구성요소.
        </p>
        <p>
          Items without 구성요소 do not have a “Cost” entry. For them, 시장 가격 and the base price are the same. The
          cost in gp is 1/2 시장 가격, and the cost in XP is 1/25 시장 가격.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Weight: The notational entry for many 고급 아이템 ends with a value for the item’s weight. When a weight
          figure is not given, the item has no weight worth noting (for 목적 of determining how much of a load a
          character can carry).

        <h2>마법 아이템 제작</h2>
        <div class="original-headline">CREATING MAGIC ITEMS</div>
        <p>
          To create 마법 아이템, spellcasters use special 특기. They invest time, money, and their own personal energy
          (in the form of experience points) in an item’s creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that all items have 전제조건 in their 묘사. These 전제조건 must be met for the item to be created. Most
          of the time, they take the form of 주문 that must be known by the item’s creator (although access through
          another magic item or spellcaster is allowed).
        </p>
        <p>
          While item creation costs are handled in detail below, note that normally the two primary factors are the
          시전자 레벨 of the creator and 레벨 of the spell or 주문 put into the item. A creator can create an item at a
          lower 시전자 레벨 than her own, but never lower than the minimum 레벨 needed to cast the needed spell. Using
          메타마법 특기, a caster can place 주문 in items at a higher 레벨 than normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Magic supplies for items are always half of the base price in gp and 1/25 of the base price in XP. For many
          items, 시장 가격 equals the base price.
        </p>
        <p>
          갑옷, 방패, 무기, and items with a value independent of their magically enhanced properties add their item
          cost to 시장 가격. The item cost does not influence the base price (which determines the cost of magic
          supplies and 경험치 비용), but it does increase the final 시장 가격.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, some items cast or replicate 주문 with costly material 구성요소 or with XP 구성요소. For these
          items, 시장 가격 equals the base price plus an extra price for the spell component costs. Each XP in the
          component costs adds 5 gp to 시장 가격. The cost to create these items is the magic supplies cost and the base
          XP cost (both determined by the base price) plus the costs for 구성요소. 묘사 of these items include an entry
          that gives the total cost of creating the item.
        </p>
        <p>
          The creator also needs a fairly quiet, comfortable, and well-lit place in which to work. Any place suitable
          for preparing 주문 is suitable for making items. Creating an item requires one day per 1,000 gp in the item’s
          base price, with a minimum of at least one day. Potions are an exception to this rule; they always take just
          one day to brew. The character must spend the gold and XP at the beginning of 제작 process.
        </p>
        <p>
          The caster works for 8 hours each day. He cannot rush the process by working longer each day. But the days
          need not be consecutive, and the caster can use the rest of his time as he sees fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          A character can work on only one item at a time. If a character starts work on a new item, all materials used
          and XP spent on the under-제작 item are wasted.
        </p>
        <p>The secrets of creating 유물 are long lost.</p>

        <p>MAGIC ITEM GOLD PIECE VALUES</p>
        <p>
          Many factors must be considered when determining the price of new 마법 아이템. The easiest way to come up with
          a price is to match the new item to an item that is already priced that price as a guide. Otherwise, use the
          guidelines summarized on 표: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Multiple Similar 능력: </b><span>For items with multiple similar 능력 that don’t take up space on a character’s body use the following
            formula: Calculate the price of the single most costly ability, then add 75% of the value of the next most
            costly ability, plus one-half the value of any other 능력.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Multiple Different 능력: </b><span>능력 such as an 명중 굴림 보너스 or 내성 굴림 보너스 and a spell-like function are not similar, and their
            values are simply added together to determine the cost. For items that do take up a space on a character’s
            body each additional power not only has no discount but instead has a 50% increase in price.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>0-레벨 주문: </b><span>When 곱하기 spell 레벨 to determine value, 0- 레벨 주문 should be treated as 1/2 레벨.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Other Considerations: </b><span>Once you have a final cost figure, reduce that number if either of the following 상태이상 applies:</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          —<i>Item Requires Skill to Use: </i>Some items require a specific skill to
          get them to function. This factor should reduce the cost about 10%.
        </p>
        <p>
          —<i>Item Requires Specific Class or 성향 to Use: </i>Even more restrictive
          than requiring a skill, this limitation cuts the cost by 30%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prices presented in 마법 아이템 설명(the gold piece value following the item’s 시전자 레벨) are the market
          value, which is generally twice what it costs the creator to make the item.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since different classes get access to certain 주문 at different 레벨, the prices for two characters to make
          the same item might actually be different. An item is only worth two times what the caster of lowest possible
          레벨 can make it for. Calculate 시장 가격 based on the lowest possible 레벨 caster, no matter who makes the
          item.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not all items adhere to these formulas directly. The reasons for this are several. First and foremost, these
          few formulas aren’t enough to truly gauge the exact differences between items. The price of a magic item may
          be modified based on its actual worth. The formulas only provide a starting point. The pricing of 두루마리
          assumes that, whenever possible, a 마법사 or 사제 created it. Potions and 마법막대 follow the formulas
          exactly. 마법지팡이 follow the formulas closely, and other items require at least some judgment calls.

          <div class="original-headline">MASTERWORK ITEMS</div>
          <p>
            명품 아이템 are extraordinarily well-made items. They are more expensive, but they benefit the user with
            improved quality. They are not magical in any way. However, only 명품 아이템 may be enhanced to become magic
            갑옷 and 무기. (Items that are not 무기 or 갑옷 may or may not be 명품 아이템.)

          <h3>마법 갑옷 제작</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">CREATING MAGIC ARMOR</div>
          <p>
            To create magic 갑옷, a character needs a heat source and some iron, wood, or leatherworking tools. He also
            needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being 갑옷 or the pieces of 갑옷 to be assembled. 갑옷 to be
            made into magic 갑옷 must be 명품 갑옷, and the masterwork cost is added to the base price to determine
            final market value. Additional magic supplies costs for the materials are subsumed in the cost for creating
            the magic 갑옷—half the base price of the item.
          </p>
          <p>
            마법 갑옷 제작 has a special prerequisite: The creator’s 시전자 레벨 must be at least three times the
            enhancement 보너스 of 갑옷. If an item has both an enhancement 보너스 and a special ability, the higher of
            the two 시전자 레벨 필요조건 must be met.
          </p>
          <p>
            Magic 갑옷 or a magic 방패 must have at least a +1 enhancement 보너스 to have any of 능력 listed on 표: 갑옷
            특수 능력 and 표: 방패 특수 능력.
          </p>
          <p>
            If 주문 are involved in 전제조건 for making 갑옷, the creator must have prepared 주문 to be cast (or must
            know 주문, in the case of a 소서러 or 음유시인), must provide any material 구성요소 or focuses 주문 require,
            and must pay any XP costs required for 주문. The act of working on 갑옷 트리거 the prepared 주문, making
            them unavailable for casting during each day of 갑옷’s creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended
            from his currently prepared 주문, just as if they had been cast.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Creating some 갑옷 may entail other 전제조건 beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual 묘사 for
            details.
          </p>
          <p>Crafting magic 갑옷 requires one day for each 1,000 gp value of the base price.</p>

            also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the weapon or the pieces of the weapon to be
            assembled. Only a masterwork weapon can become a 마법 무기, and the masterwork cost is added to the total
            cost to determine final market value. Additional magic supplies costs for the materials are subsumed in the
            cost for creating 마법 무기—half the base price given on 표: 무기, according to the weapon’s total effective
            보너스.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creating a 마법 무기 has a special prerequisite: The creator’s 시전자 레벨 must be at least three times the
            enhancement 보너스 of the weapon. If an item has both an enhancement 보너스 and a special ability the higher
            of the two 시전자 레벨 필요조건 must be met.
          </p>
          <p>
            A 마법 무기 must have at least a +1 enhancement 보너스 to have any of 능력 listed on 표: 근접 무기 특수 능력
            or Table Ranged Weapon 특수 능력.
          </p>
          <p>
            If 주문 are involved in 전제조건 for making the weapon, the creator must have prepared 주문 to be cast (or
            must know 주문, in the case of a 소서러 or 음유시인) but need not provide any material 구성요소 or focuses
            주문 require, nor are any XP costs inherent in a prerequisite spell incurred in the creation of the item.
            The act of working on the weapon 트리거 the prepared 주문, making them unavailable for casting during each
            day of the weapon’s creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared 주문,
            just as if they had been cast.)
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time of creation, the creator must decide if the weapon glows or not as a side-effect of the magic
            imbued within it. This decision does not affect the price or the creation time, but once the item is
            finished, the decision is 결속.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creating magic double-headed 무기 is treated as creating two 무기 when determining cost, time, XP, and 특수
            능력.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creating some 무기 may entail other 전제조건 beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual 묘사 for
            details.

          <div class="original-headline">CREATING POTIONS</div>
          <p>
            The creator of a potion needs a 레벨 working surface and at least a few containers in which to mix liquids,
            as well as a source of heat to boil the brew. In addition, he needs ingredients. The costs for materials and
            ingredients are subsumed in the cost for brewing the potion—25 gp × 레벨 of the spell x 레벨 of the caster.
          </p>
          <p>
            All ingredients and materials used to brew a potion must be fresh and unused. The character must pay the
            full cost for brewing each potion. (Economies of scale do not apply.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The imbiber of the potion is both the caster and the target. 주문 with a 거리 of personal cannot be made
            into potions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The creator must have prepared the spell to be placed in the potion (or must know the spell, in the case of
            a 소서러 or 음유시인) and must provide any material component or focus the spell requires.
          </p>
          <p>
            If casting the spell would reduce the caster’s XP total, he pays the XP cost upon beginning the brew in
            addition to the XP cost for making the potion itself. Material 구성요소 are consumed when he begins working,
            but a focus is not. (A focus used in brewing a potion can be reused.) The act of brewing 트리거 the prepared
            spell, making it unavailable for casting until the character has rested and regained 주문. (That is, that
            spell slot is expended from his currently prepared 주문, just as if it had been cast.) Brewing a potion
            requires one day.

          <p>
            The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the staff—375 gp x 레벨 of the highest-레벨
            spell x 레벨 of the caster, plus 75% of the value of the next most costly ability (281.25 gp x 레벨 of the
            spell x 레벨 of the caster), plus one-half of the value of any other 능력(187.5 gp x 레벨 of the spell x
            레벨 of the caster). 마법지팡이 are always fully charged (50 돌격) when created.
          </p>
          <p>
            If desired, a spell can be placed into the staff at only half the normal cost, but then activating that
            particular spell costs 2 돌격 from the staff. 시전자 레벨 of all 주문 in a staff must be the same, and no
            staff can have a 시전자 레벨 of less than 8th, even if all 주문 in the staff are low-레벨 주문.
          </p>
          <p>
            The creator must have prepared 주문 to be stored (or must know the spell, in the case of a 소서러 or
            음유시인) and must provide any focus 주문 require as well as material and XP component costs sufficient to
            activate the spell a maximum number of times (50 divided by the number of 돌격 one use of the spell
            expends). This is in addition to the XP cost for making the staff itself. Material 구성요소 are consumed
            when he begins working, but focuses are not. (A focus used in creating a staff can be reused.) The act of
            working on the staff 트리거 the prepared 주문, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the
            staff ’s creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared 주문, just as if
            they had been cast.)

          <div class="original-headline">CREATING WANDS</div>
          <p>
            To create a magic wand, a character needs a small supply of materials, the most obvious being a baton or the
            pieces of the wand to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the
            wand—375 gp x 레벨 of the spell x 레벨 of the caster. 마법막대 are always fully charged (50 돌격) when
            created.
          </p>
          <p>
            The creator must have prepared the spell to be stored (or must know the spell, in the case of a 소서러 or
            음유시인) and must provide any focuses the spell requires. Fifty of each needed material component are
            required, one for each 돌격. If casting the spell would reduce the caster’s XP total, she pays the cost
            (multiplied by 50) upon beginning the wand in addition to the XP cost for making the wand itself. Likewise,
            material 구성요소 are consumed when she begins working, but focuses are not. (A focus used in creating a
            wand can be reused.) The act of working on the wand 트리거 the prepared spell, making it unavailable for
            casting during each day devoted to the wand’s creation. (That is, that spell slot is expended from her
            currently prepared 주문, just as if it had been cast.)

          <p>
            To create a wondrous item, a character usually needs some sort of 장비 or tools to work on the item. She
            also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the item itself or the pieces of the item to be

            difficult to formularize. Refer to 표: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values and use the item prices in
            the item 묘사 as a guideline. Creating an item costs half the market value listed.
          </p>
          <p>
            If 주문 are involved in 전제조건 for making the item, the creator must have prepared 주문 to be cast (or

          <div class="original-headline">INTELLIGENT ITEM CREATION</div>
          <p>
            To create an intelligent item, a character must have a 시전자 레벨 of 15th or higher. Time and creation cost
            are based on the normal item creation rules, with 시장 가격 values on 표: Item 지능, 지혜, 매력, and
            Capabilities treated as additions to time, gp cost, and XP cost. The item’s 성향 is the same as its
            creator’s. Determine other features randomly, following the guidelines in the relevant section.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="h3-24-adding-new-abilities">
          <h3>새로운 능력 추가</h3>
          <div class="original-headline">ADDING NEW ABILITIES</div>
          <p>
            A creator can add new magical 능력 to a magic item with no restrictions. The cost to do this is the same as
            if the item was not magical. Thus, a <i>+1 longsword </i>can be made into a
            <i>+2 vorpal longsword</i>, with the cost to create it being equal to that
            of a <i>+2 vorpal sword </i>minus the cost of a
            <i>+1 sword</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the item is one that occupies a specific place on a character’s body the cost of adding any additional
            ability to that item increases by 50%. For example, if a character adds the power to confer
            <i>투명화 </i>to her
            <i>ring of protection +2</i>, the cost of adding this ability is the same
            as for creating a <i>ring of 투명화 </i>multiplied by 1.5.
          </p>
          <p>BODY SLOT AFFINITIES</p>
          <p>
            Each location on the body, or body slot, has one or more affinities: a word or phrase that describes the
            general function or nature of 마법 아이템 designed for that body slot. Body slot affinities are deliberately
            broad, abstract categorizations, because a hard-and-fast rule can’t 엄폐 the great variety among 고급

          <p>
            You can use the affinities in the list below to guide your decisions on which 마법 아이템 should be allowed
            in which body slots. And when you design your own 마법 아이템, the affinities give you some 길라잡이 for
            what form a particular item should take.
          </p>
          <p>Some body slots have different affinities for different specific items.</p>
