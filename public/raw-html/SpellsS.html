          Any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly 공격 the warded creature, even with a targeted spell,
          must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the opponent can 공격 normally and is unaffected by that
          casting of the spell. If the save fails, the opponent can’t follow through with 공격, that part of its action
          is lost, and it can’t directly 공격 the warded creature for 지속시간 of the spell. Those not attempting to
          공격 the subject remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked or
          affected by 범위 or effect 주문. The subject cannot 공격 without breaking the spell but may use nonattack 주문
          or otherwise act.

          This spell combines several elements to create a powerful protection from 염탐 and direct observation. When
          casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in the spell의 범위. 환영술 created must be
          stated in general terms. Once 상태이상 are set, they cannot be changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Attempts to scry 범위 automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed. Sight and sound are
          appropriate to 환영술 created.
        </p>
        <p>
          Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal 환영술), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen.
          Even entering 범위 does not cancel 환영술 or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care
          to stay out of the way of those affected by 환영술.

          You can see and hear some creature, which may be at any distance. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, the
          염탐 attempt simply fails. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort
          of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it
          gets a +5 보너스 on its Will save.

        <p>
          You 숨기 a chest on 에테리얼 세계 for as long as sixty days and can 물체 염동 it at will. The chest can
          contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per 시전자 레벨(regardless of the chest의 actual size, which is about 3
          feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75% chance that the spell
          simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can 물체 염동 it by concentrating (a standard action), and it
          appears next to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by 마스터 제작가. The cost of
          such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same
          materials and perfect in every detail), so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The
          replica costs 50 gp.) You can have but one pair of these chests at any given time—even a
          <i>소원 </i>spell does not allow more. The chests are nonmagical and can be
          fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be.
        </p>
        <p>
          To 숨기 the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into
          에테리얼 세계. You need the replica to recall the chest. After sixty days, there is a cumulative chance of 5%
          per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no
          way, not even with a <i>소원 </i>spell, that the large chest can be summoned
          back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Living things in the chest eat, 수면, and 나이 normally, and they die if they 달리기 out of food, air, water,
          or whatever they need to survive.

          S<i>ecret page </i>alters the contents of a page so that they appear to be
          something entirely different. The text of a spell can be changed to show even another spell.
          <i>폭발성 룬 </i>or

        <p>
          A <i>언어 이해 </i>spell alone cannot reveal a

          by speaking a special word. You can then peruse the actual page, and return it to its
          <i>비밀 페이지 </i>form at will. You can also remove the spell by double
          repetition of the special word. A <i>마법 감지 </i>spell reveals dim magic on
          the page in question but does not reveal its true contents. T<i>rue seeing </i>reveals the presence of the hidden material but does not reveal the contents unless cast in combination with
          <i>언어 이해. </i>A <i>비밀 페이지 </i>spell
          can be dispelled, and the hidden writings can be destroyed by means of an

          You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is common in 범위 where the spell is cast. The
          floor is 레벨, clean, and dry. In all respects the lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two
          shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shelter has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore, it must be
          heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does,
          however, provide considerable security otherwise—it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its
          material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal
          missiles (but not the sort cast by 공성 무기 or 거인).
        </p>
        <p>
          The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being
          <i>arcane locked </i>and the latter secured by an iron grate at the top and a
          narrow flue. In addition, these three 범위 are protected by an
          <i>알람 </i>spell. Finally, an
          <i>보이지 않는 하인 </i>is conjured to provide service to you for the
          지속시간 of the shelter.

          The <i>안전 가옥 </i>contains rude furnishings —eight bunks, a trestle table,

          You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and send a short 통보 of twenty-five words or
          less to the subject. The subject recognizes you if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately. A

          When you cast <i>먹빛 뱀의 인장, </i>a small symbol appears in the text of
          one written work such as a book, scroll, or map. The text containing the symbol must be at least twenty-five
          words long. When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the
          <i>sepia 뱀 </i>springs into being and strikes the reader, provided there is
          line of effect between the symbol and the reader.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to 트리거 the spell; the subject must deliberately read it.
          The target is entitled to a save to evade 뱀의 strike. If it succeeds, the
          <i>sepia 뱀 </i>dissipates in a flash of brown 빛 accompanied by a puff of
          dun-colored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field
          of force and immobilized until released, either at your 명령 or when 1d4 days + one day per 시전자 레벨 have
          elapsed.
        </p>
        <p>
          While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not 나이, breathe, grow hungry, 수면, or regain
          주문. It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings. It can be damaged by
          outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury.
          However, a 죽어가고 있음 subject does not lose 히트 포인트 or become stable until the spell ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and
          <i>마법 감지 </i>reveals only that the entire text is magical.

        <p>
          A <i>마법 무효화 </i>can remove the sigil. An

          To use the <i>어둠 보행 </i>spell, you must be in an 범위 of shadowy
          illumination. You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the
          edge of 물질 세계 where it borders 어둠의 세계. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real.
          You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your 레벨 limit), but all must be touching each
          other.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the region of 어둠, you 이동 at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of 어둠의 세계
          but much more rapidly relative to 물질 세계. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto
          어둠의 세계, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto 물질 세계.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of the blurring of reality between 어둠의 세계 and 물질 세계, you can’t make out details of the
          terrain or 범위 you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It의
          impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying.
          Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10x100 feet in a random horizontal direction from
          your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10x1,000 feet in the
          same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are
          shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued
          (no save).
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>어둠 보행 </i><span>can also be used to travel to other 이세계 that border on 어둠의 세계, but this usage requires the transit
            of 어둠의 세계 to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of 어둠의 세계 requires 1d4
            hours.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Any creatures touched by you when <i>어둠 보행 </i>is cast also make the
          transition to the borders of 어둠의 세계.
        </p>
        <p>
          They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into 물질 세계(50% chance for either
          of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into 어둠의
          세계 receive a Will 내성 굴림, negating the effect if successful.

          the form of any single nonunique creature (of any type) from Fine to Colossal size. The assumed form cannot
          have more than your 시전자 레벨 in 히트 다이스(to a maximum of 25 HD). Unlike

          You gain all extraordinary and supernatural 능력(both 공격 and qualities) of the assumed form, but you lose

          You emit an ear-splitting yell that deafens and 피해 creatures in its path. Any creature within 범위 is
          deafened for 2d6 rounds and takes 5d6 points of sonic 피해. A successful save negates the deafness and reduces
          피해 by half. Any exposed brittle or crystalline object or crystalline creature takes 1d6 points of sonic 피해
          per 시전자 레벨(maximum 15d6). An affected creature is allowed a Fortitude save to reduce 피해 by half, and a

          You are able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size limit) to 1/16 of its normal size in each
          dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original volume and 광역). This change effectively reduces the object의 size
          by four categories. Optionally, you can also change its now shrunken composition to a clothlike one. Objects
          changed by a <i>아이템 수축 </i>spell can be returned to normal composition
          and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of 명령 from the original caster. Even a

          <i>복제 </i><span>creates an illusory duplicate of any creature. The duplicate creature is partially real and formed from ice
            or snow. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has only one-half of the real creature의 레벨 or
            히트 다이스(and the appropriate 히트 포인트, 특기, 스킬 등급, and 특수 능력 for a creature of that 레벨 or
            HD). You can’t create a 복제 of a creature whose 히트 다이스 or 레벨 exceed twice your 시전자 레벨. You must
            make a 변장 check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is. A creature familiar with
            the original might detect the ruse with a successful 감지 check (opposed by the caster의 변장 check) or a DC

          nothingness. A complex process requiring at least 24 hours, 100 gp per hit point, and a fully equipped magical

          This spell enables you to make a 올무 that functions as a magic trap. 올무 can be made from any supple vine, a
          thong, or a rope. When you cast <i>올무 </i>upon it, the cordlike object
          blends with its surroundings (탐색 DC 23 for a character with the 함정 찾기 ability to locate). One end of
          올무 is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the
          circle.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a strong and supple tree is nearby, 올무 can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend and then
          straighten when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of 피해 to the creature trapped and lifting it off
          the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the
          creature, dealing no 피해 but causing it to be entangled.
        </p>
        <p>
          올무 is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 탈출 전문가 check or a DC 23 근력 check that
          is a full-round action. 올무 has AC 7 and 5 히트 포인트. A successful escape from 올무 breaks the loop and
          ends the spell.

          When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in the spell의 범위 is softened. Wet earth
          becomes thick mud, dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay that is easily molded or
          chopped. You affect a 10-footsquare 범위 to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on 거칠음 or resilience of the
          ground at that 감지. Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected. Earth or stone creatures
          are not affected.
        </p>
        <p>
          A creature in mud must succeed on a Reflex save or be caught for 1d2 rounds and unable to 이동, 공격, or cast
          주문. A creature that succeeds on its save can 이동 through the mud at half 속도, and it can’t 달리기 or 돌격.
        </p>
        <p>
          Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in 범위 can 이동 at only half their normal 속도 and
          can’t 달리기 or 돌격 over the surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stone softened into clay does not hinder 이동, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate 범위
          they may not have been able to affect before.
        </p>
        <p>
          While <i>물렁한 대지와 암석 </i>does not affect dressed or worked stone,
          cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate
          collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls.
        </p>

          This spell functions like <i>안개 구름</i>, but in addition to obscuring
          sight, the <i>짙은 안개 </i>is so thick that any creature attempting to 이동
          through it progresses at a 속도 of 5 feet, regardless of its normal 속도, and it takes a –2 페널티 on all
          melee 공격 and melee 피해 rolls. The vapors prevent effective 원거리 무기 공격(except for magic 광선 and the
          like). A creature or object that falls into <i>짙은 안개 </i>is slowed, so
          that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces 낙하 피해 by 1d6. A creature can’t take a 5-foot
          step while in <i>짙은 안개.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          However, unlike normal 안개, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>짙은 안개 </i><span>can be made permanent with a <i>영구화 </i>spell. A permanent

          This spell causes those within 범위 to turn on each other rather than 공격 their foes. Each affected creature
          has a 50% chance to 공격 the nearest target each round. (Roll to determine each creature의 behavior every
          round at the beginning of its turn.) A creature that does not 공격 its nearest neighbor is free to act

          You grant the semblance of life and intellect to a corpse, allowing it to answer several questions that you
          put to it. You may ask one question per two 시전자 레벨. Unasked questions are wasted if 지속시간 expires. The
          corpse의 지식 is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any).
          Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive. If the creature의 성향 was different from yours, the corpse
          gets a Will save to resist the spell as if it were alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the corpse has been subject to <i>시체와 대화 </i>within the past week,
          the new spell fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but
          the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or
          partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to 말하기 at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          This spell does not let you actually 말하기 to the person (whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the
          imprinted 지식 stored in the corpse. The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once
          inhabited it, and thus it can 말하기 with all 지식 that the creature had while alive. The corpse, however,
          cannot learn new information.
        </p>

          A ghostly, glowing hand shaped from your life force materializes and 이동 as you desire, allowing you to

          when the spell ends (even if it is dispelled), but not if the hand is destroyed. (히트 포인트 can be healed as
          normal.) For as long as the spell lasts, any touch 거리 spell of 4 레벨 or lower that you cast can be
          delivered by the <i>유령의 손</i>. The spell gives you a +2 보너스 on your
          melee touch 명중 굴림, and attacking with the hand counts normally as an 공격. The hand always strikes from
          your direction. The hand cannot flank targets like a creature can. After it delivers a spell, or if the hand
          goes beyond the spell 거리, goes out of your sight, the hand returns to you and 호버링.

          A weapon made of pure force springs into existence and 공격 opponents at a distance, as you direct it, dealing
          1d8 force 피해 per hit, +1 point per three 시전자 레벨(maximum +5 at 15th 레벨). The weapon takes the shape of
          a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below)
          and has the same threat 거리 and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent
          you designate, starting with one 공격 in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on
          your turn. It uses your 기본 공격 보너스(possibly allowing it multiple 공격 per round in subsequent rounds)
          plus your 지혜 수정치 as its 공격 보너스. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can 피해
          creatures that have 피해 축소. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss
          chance associated with 비실체상태. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a 협공
          보너스 or help a combatant get one. Your 특기 or 전투 actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes
          beyond the spell 거리, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you
          and 호버링.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each round after the first, you can use a 이동 action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not,
          the weapon continues to 공격 the previous round의 target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it
          gets one 공격. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple 공격 if your base
          공격 보너스 would allow it to. Even if the <i>영혼의 무기 </i>is a ranged
          weapon, use the spell의 거리, not the weapon의 normal 거리 increment, and switching targets still is a 이동
          action.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <i>영혼의 무기 </i>cannot be attacked or harmed by physical 공격, but
          <i>마법 무효화</i>, <i>분해</i>, a
          <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a
          <i>rod of cancellation </i>affects it. A
          <i>영혼의 무기</i>의 AC against touch 공격 is 12 (10 + size 보너스 for Tiny
          object).
        </p>
        <p>
          If an attacked creature has 주문 저항, you make a 시전자 레벨 check (1d20 + 시전자 레벨) against that 주문
          저항 the first time the <i>영혼의 무기 </i>strikes it. If the weapon is
          successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature
          for 지속시간 of the spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity의 own personal weapon. A 사제 without a deity
          gets a weapon based on his 성향. A neutral 사제 without a deity can create a
          <i>영혼의 무기 </i>of any 성향, provided he is acting at least generally in
          accord with that 성향 at the time. 무기 associated with each 성향 are as follows.

          A <i>석상 </i>spell turns the subject to solid stone, along with any garments

          When you need to keep 추적 of comrades who may get separated,
          <i>상태확인 </i>allows you to mentally monitor their relative positions and
          general condition. You are aware of direction and distance to the creatures and any 상태이상 affecting them:
          unharmed, wounded, 행동 불능, staggered, unconscious, 죽어가고 있음, nauseated, panicked, stunned, poisoned,
          diseased, <i>confused, </i>or the like. Once the spell has been cast upon the
          subjects, the distance between them and the caster does not affect the spell as long as they are on the same
          plane of existence. If a subject leaves the plane, or if it dies, the spell ceases to function for it.

          This spell restores a petrified creature to its normal state, restoring life and goods. The creature must make
          a DC 15 Fortitude save to survive the process. Any petrified creature, regardless of size, can be restored.
        </p>
        <p>
          The spell also can convert a 광역 of stone into a fleshy substance. Such flesh is inert and lacking a vital
          life force unless a life force or magical energy is available. (For example, this spell would turn a 돌 골렘
          into a 살덩이 골렘, but an ordinary 석상 would become a corpse.) You can affect an object that fits within a
          cylinder from 1 foot to 3 feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long or a cylinder of up to those dimensions in a
          larger 광역 of stone.

          This spell creates an enormous black storm cloud. Lightning and crashing claps of thunder appear within the
          storm. Each creature beneath the cloud must succeed on a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4x10 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do not maintain 집중 on the spell after casting it, the spell ends.&nbsp; If you continue to
          concentrate, the spell generates additional effects in each following round, as noted below. Each effect
          occurs during your turn.
        </p>

          <i>2nd Round: </i><span>Acid rains down in 범위, dealing 1d6 points of acid 피해(no save).</span>

        <p>
          <i>3rd Round: </i><span>You call six 화살 of lightning down from the cloud. You decide where 화살 strike. No two 화살
            may be directed at the same target. Each 화살 deals 10d6 points of electricity 피해. A creature struck
            can attempt a Reflex save for half 피해.</span>

        <p>
          <i>5th through 10th Rounds: </i><span>Violent rain and wind gusts reduce visibility. The rain obscures all sight, including 암흑시야, beyond 5
            feet. A creature 5 feet away has 은폐(공격 have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total 은폐
            (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). 속도 is reduced by
            three-quarters.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Ranged 공격 within 범위 of the storm are impossible. 주문 cast within 범위 are disrupted unless the caster
          succeeds on a 집중 check against a DC equal to the
          <i>폭풍의 복수</i>의 save DC + 레벨 of the spell the caster is trying to
          cast.

          You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or
          two). The <i>제안 </i>must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity
          sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the
          spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire 지속시간. If the suggested activity can be
          completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead
          specify 상태이상 that will 트리거 a special activity during 지속시간. If the condition is not met before the
          spell 지속시간 expires, the activity is not performed.
        </p>
        <p>
          A very reasonable <i>제안 </i>causes the save to be made with 페널티(such as
          –1 or –2).

          your feet (your choice). The instrument is typical for its type. Only one instrument appears per casting, and
          it will play only for you. You can’t summon an instrument too large to be held in two hands.

          This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider, 정령, or magical beast native to another
          plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It 공격 your opponents to the best
          of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to 공격, to 공격 particular
          enemies, or to 공연 other actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-레벨 list on the accompanying Summon Monster table. You
          choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or
          planar travel 능력. Creatures cannot be summoned into an 환경 that cannot support them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature,
          it is a spell of that type.

          This spell summons a natural creature. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It
          공격 your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it
          not to 공격, to 공격 particular enemies, or to 공연 other actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or
          planar travel 능력. Creatures cannot be summoned into an 환경 that cannot support them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-레벨 list on the accompanying 자연의 동료 소환 table.
          You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell. All
          the creatures on the table are neutral unless otherwise noted.

          For 지속시간 of this spell, you can use a standard action to evoke a dazzling beam of intense 빛 each round.
          You can call forth one beam per three 시전자 레벨(maximum six beams at 18th 레벨). The spell ends when its
          지속시간 달리기 out or your allotment of beams is exhausted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each creature in the beam is blinded and takes 4d6 points of 피해. Any creatures to which sunlight is harmful
          or unnatural take double 피해. A successful Reflex save negates the blindness and reduces 피해 by half.
        </p>
        <p>
          An undead creature caught within the beam takes 1d6 points of 피해 per 시전자 레벨(maximum 20d6), or half 피해
          if a Reflex save is successful. In addition, the beam results in 파괴 of any undead creature specifically
          harmed by bright 빛 if it fails its save.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ultraviolet 빛 generated by the spell deals 피해 to fungi, mold, 늪괴물, and slimes just as if they were

          <i>죽음의 상징 </i>affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures
          with too many 히트 포인트 to affect. Once triggered, the
          <i>symbol </i>becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per 시전자
          레벨 or until it has affected 150 히트 포인트’ worth of creatures, whichever comes first. Any creature that
          enters 범위 while the <i>죽음의 상징 </i>is active is subject to its effect,
          whether or not that creature was in 범위 when it was triggered. A creature need save against the
          <i>symbol </i>only once as long as it remains within 범위, though if it
          leaves 범위 and returns while the <i>symbol </i>is still active, it must save
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until it is triggered, the <i>죽음의 상징 </i>is inactive (though visible and
          legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a <i>죽음의 상징 </i>must
          always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the
          <i>죽음의 상징 </i>ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in
          which case the <i>죽음의 상징 </i>works normally.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a default, a <i>죽음의 상징 </i>is triggered whenever a creature does one
          or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the
          rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of 트리거 method or methods chosen, a creature
          more than 60 feet from a 죽음의 상징 can’t 트리거 it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering 상태이상,
          such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a <i>죽음의 상징</i>의
          triggering 상태이상 cannot be changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, “reading” the rune means any attempt to study it, 식별 it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a
          엄폐 over a <i>죽음의 상징 </i>to render it inoperative 트리거 it if the
          symbol reacts to touch. You can’t use a <i>죽음의 상징 </i>offensively; for
          instance, a touch-triggered 죽음의 상징 remains untriggered if an item bearing the
          <i>죽음의 상징 </i>is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a
          <i>죽음의 상징 </i>cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the
          weapon strikes a foe.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you
          desire. Special 상태이상 for triggering a <i>죽음의 상징 </i>can be based on
          a creature의 이름, identity, or 성향, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.
          Intangibles such as 레벨, class, 히트 다이스, and 히트 포인트 don’t qualify.
        </p>
        <p>
          When scribing a <i>죽음의 상징</i>, you can specify a password or phrase that
          prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect<i>. </i>Anyone using
          the password remains immune to that particular rune의 effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet
          of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.
        </p>
        <p>
          You also can attune any number of creatures to the <i>죽음의 상징, </i>but
          doing this can extend 시전 시간. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small
          group (as many as ten creatures) extends 시전 시간 to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five
          creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer. Any creature attuned to a
          <i>죽음의 상징 </i>cannot 트리거 it and is immune to its effects, even if
          within its radius when triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own
          <i>symbols of death</i>, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot
          inadvertently 트리거 them.

          <i>마법 읽기 </i><span>allows you to 식별 a <i>죽음의 상징 </i>with a DC 19 주문학 check. Of

            this will 트리거 the symbol.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          A <i>죽음의 상징 </i>can be removed by a successful
          <i>마법 무효화 </i>targeted solely on the rune. An
          <i>삭제 </i>spell has no effect on a
          <i>죽음의 상징. </i>파괴 of the surface where a
          <i>죽음의 상징 </i>is inscribed destroys the
