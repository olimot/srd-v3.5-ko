          The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). A gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces. Each silver piece is
          worth 10 copper pieces (cp). In addition to copper, silver, and gold coins, there are also platinum pieces
          (pp), which are each worth 10 gp.
        </p>
        <p>The standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce (fifty to the pound).</p>

      <h1>무기</h1>
      <section id="h2-6-weapon-categories">
        <h2>무기 분류</h2>
        <p>Weapons are grouped into several interlocking sets of categories.</p>
        <p>
          These categories pertain to what training is needed to become proficient in a weapon’s use (simple, martial,
          or exotic), the weapon’s usefulness either in close combat (melee) or at a distance (ranged, which includes
          both thrown and projectile weapons), its relative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed), and its size
          (Small, Medium, or Large).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>단순, 무예, 생소한 무기:</strong> Anybody but a druid, monk, rogue, or wizard is proficient with all
          simple weapons. Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient with all simple and all martial
          weapons. Characters of other classes are proficient with an assortment of mainly simple weapons and possibly
          also some martial or even exotic weapons. A character who uses a weapon with which he or she is not proficient
          takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>근접 및 원거리 무기:</strong> Melee weapons are used for making melee attacks, though some of them can
          be thrown as well. Ranged weapons are thrown weapons or projectile weapons that are not effective in melee.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>긴 무기:</em> Glaives, guisarmes, lances, longspears, ranseurs, spiked chains, and whips are reach
          weapons. A reach weapon is a melee weapon that allows its wielder to strike at targets that aren’t adjacent to
          him or her. Most reach double the wielder’s natural reach, meaning that a typical Small or Medium wielder of
          such a weapon can attack a creature 10 feet away, but not a creature in an adjacent square. A typical Large
          character wielding a reach weapon of the appropriate size can attack a creature 15 or 20 feet away, but not
          adjacent creatures or creatures up to 10 feet away.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>쌍날 무기:</em> Dire flails, dwarven urgroshes, gnome hooked hammers, orc double axes, quarterstaffs, and
          two-bladed swords are double weapons. A character can fight with both ends of a double weapon as if fighting
          with two weapons, but he or she incurs all the normal attack penalties associated with two-weapon combat, just
          as though the character were wielding a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The character can also choose to use a double weapon two handed, attacking with only one end of it. A creature
          wielding a double weapon in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be used in
          any given round.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>투척 무기:</em> Daggers, clubs, shortspears, spears, darts, javelins, throwing axes, light hammers,
          tridents, shuriken, and nets are thrown weapons. The wielder applies his or her Strength modifier to damage
          dealt by thrown weapons (except for splash weapons). It is possible to throw a weapon that isn’t designed to
          be thrown (that is, a melee weapon that doesn’t have a numeric entry in the Range Increment column on Table:
          Weapons), but a character who does so takes a –4 penalty on the attack roll. Throwing a light or one-handed
          weapon is a standard action, while throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action. Regardless of the type
          of weapon, such an attack scores a threat only on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical
          hit. Such a weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>투사 무기:</em> Light crossbows, slings, heavy crossbows, shortbows, composite shortbows, longbows,
          composite longbows, hand crossbows, and repeating crossbows are projectile weapons. Most projectile weapons
          require two hands to use (see specific weapon descriptions). A character gets no Strength bonus on damage
          rolls with a projectile weapon unless it’s a specially built composite shortbow, specially built composite
          longbow, or sling. If the character has a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when he or she
          uses a bow or a sling.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>탄약:</em> Projectile weapons use ammunition: arrows (for bows), bolts (for crossbows), or sling bullets
          (for slings). When using a bow, a character can draw ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings require
          an action for reloading. Generally speaking, ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless,
          while normal ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them,
          crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them (see Masterwork Weapons), and what happens to them
          after they are thrown.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>가벼운, 한손, 양손 근접 무기:</strong> This designation is a measure of how much effort it takes to
          wield a weapon in combat. It indicates whether a melee weapon, when wielded by a character of the weapon’s
          size category, is considered a light weapon, a one-handed weapon, or a two-handed weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Light:</em> A light weapon is easier to use in one’s off hand than a one-handed weapon is, and it can be
          used while grappling. A light weapon is used in one hand. Add the wielder’s Strength bonus (if any) to damage
          rolls for melee attacks with a light weapon if it’s used in the primary hand, or one-half the wielder’s
          Strength bonus if it’s used in the off hand. Using two hands to wield a light weapon gives no advantage on
          damage; the Strength bonus applies as though the weapon were held in the wielder’s primary hand only.
        </p>
        <p>An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon.</p>
        <p>
          <em>한손:</em> A one-handed weapon can be used in either the primary hand or the off hand. Add the wielder’s
          Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with a one-handed weapon if it’s used in the primary hand, or
          1/2 his or her Strength bonus if it’s used in the off hand. If a one-handed weapon is wielded with two hands
          during melee combat, add 1-1/2 times the character’s Strength bonus to damage rolls.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>양손:</em> Two hands are required to use a two-handed melee weapon effectively. Apply 1-1/2 times the
          character’s Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with such a weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>무기 크기:</strong> Every weapon has a size category. This designation indicates the size of the
          creature for which the weapon was designed.
        </p>
        <p>
          A weapon’s size category isn’t the same as its size as an object. Instead, a weapon’s size category is keyed
          to the size of the intended wielder. In general, a light weapon is an object two size categories smaller than
          the wielder, a one-handed weapon is an object one size category smaller than the wielder, and a two-handed
          weapon is an object of the same size category as the wielder.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>부적절한 크기의 무기:</em> A creature can’t make optimum use of a weapon that isn’t properly sized for it.
          A cumulative –2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between the size of its
          intended wielder and the size of its actual wielder. If the creature isn’t proficient with the weapon a –4
          nonproficiency penalty also applies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The measure of how much effort it takes to use a weapon (whether the weapon is designated as a light,
          one-handed, or two-handed weapon for a particular wielder) is altered by one step for each size category of
          difference between the wielder’s size and the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed. If a
          weapon’s designation would be changed to something other than light, one-handed, or two-handed by this
          alteration, the creature can’t wield the weapon at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>임시변통 무기:</strong> Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat.
          Because such objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses one in combat is considered to be
          nonproficient with it and takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls made with that object. To determine the size
          category and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to
          the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 20 and
          deals double damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.

        <h2>무기 품질</h2>
        <p>Here is the format for weapon entries (given as column headings on Table: Weapons, below).</p>
        <p>
          <strong>비용:</strong> This value is the weapon’s cost in gold pieces (gp) or silver pieces (sp). The cost
          includes miscellaneous gear that goes with the weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          This cost is the same for a Small or Medium version of the weapon. A Large version costs twice the listed
          price.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>피해:</strong> The Damage columns give the damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit. The column
          labeled “Dmg (S)” is for Small weapons. The column labeled “Dmg (M)” is for Medium weapons. If two damage
          ranges are given then the weapon is a double weapon. Use the second damage figure given for the double
          weapon’s extra attack. Table: Tiny and Large Weapon Damage gives weapon damage values for weapons of those

          <strong>치명타:</strong> The entry in this column notes how the weapon is used with the rules for critical
          hits. When your character scores a critical hit, roll the damage two, three, or four times, as indicated by
          its critical multiplier (using all applicable modifiers on each roll), and add all the results together.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>예외:</em> Extra damage over and above a weapon’s normal damage is not multiplied when you score a
          critical hit.
        </p>
        <p><em>x2:</em> The weapon deals double damage on a critical hit.</p>
        <p><em>x3:</em> The weapon deals triple damage on a critical hit.</p>
        <p>
          <i>x3/x</i><i>4:</i> One head of this double weapon deals triple damage on a critical hit. The other head
          deals quadruple damage on a critical hit.
        </p>
        <p><em>x4:</em> The weapon deals quadruple damage on a critical hit.</p>
        <p>
          <i>19–20/x</i><i>2:</i> The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 19 or 20 (instead of just 20) and
          deals double damage on a critical hit. (The weapon has a threat range of 19–20.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>18–20/x</i><i>2:</i> The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 18, 19, or 20 (instead of just 20) and
          deals double damage on a critical hit. (The weapon has a threat range of 18–20.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>거리 증가:</strong> Any attack at less than this distance is not penalized for range. However, each
          full range increment imposes a cumulative –2 penalty on the attack roll. A thrown weapon has a maximum range
          of five range increments. A projectile weapon can shoot out to ten range increments.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>무게:</strong> This column gives the weight of a Medium version of the weapon. Halve this number for
          Small weapons and double it for Large weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>유형:</strong> Weapons are classified according to the type of damage they deal: bludgeoning,
          piercing, or slashing. Some monsters may be resistant or immune to attacks from certain types of weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon is of two types, the damage it deals is not half one
          type and half another; all of it is both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of
          damage to ignore any of the damage from such a weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a situation when the damage type is
          significant, the wielder can choose which type of damage to deal with such a weapon.
        </p>
        <p><strong>특수:</strong> Some weapons have special features. See the weapon descriptions for details.</p>

          Weapons found on Table: Weapons that have special options for the wielder (“you”) are described below. Splash
          weapons are described under Special Substances and Items.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>화살:</strong> An arrow used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (–4 penalty on
          attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier x2). Arrows come in a leather
          quiver that holds 20 arrows. An arrow that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of
          being destroyed or lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>도끼, 오크 쌍날:</strong> An orc double axe is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting
          with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two
          weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          A creature wielding an orc double axe in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon
          can be used in any given round.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>팔맷돌:</strong> You can use this weapon to make a ranged trip attack against an opponent. You can’t
          be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a set of bolas.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>석궁화살:</strong> A crossbow bolt used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (–4
          penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (crit x2). Bolts come in a wooden case that
          holds 10 bolts (or 5, for a repeating crossbow). A bolt that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has
          a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>탄환, 무릿매:</strong> Bullets come in a leather pouch that holds 10 bullets. A bullet that hits its
          target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>사슬, 가시:</strong> A spiked chain has reach, so you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it. In
          addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, it can be used against an adjacent foe.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can make trip attacks with the chain. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the
          chain to avoid being tripped.
        </p>
        <p>
          When using a spiked chain, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including
          the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to
          attack rolls with a spiked chain sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>석궁, 손:</strong> You can draw a hand crossbow back by hand. Loading a hand crossbow is a move action
          that provokes attacks of opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can shoot, but not load, a hand crossbow with one hand at no penalty. You can shoot a hand crossbow with
          each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>석궁, 무거움:</strong> You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch. Loading a heavy
          crossbow is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a heavy
          crossbow with one hand at a –4 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a heavy crossbow with each hand, but you
          take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two one-handed weapons. This penalty is cumulative with
          the penalty for one-handed firing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>석궁, 가벼움:</strong> You draw a light crossbow back by pulling a lever. Loading a light crossbow is
          a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally, operating a light crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a light
          crossbow with one hand at a –2 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a light crossbow with each hand, but you
          take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the
          penalty for one-handed firing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>석궁, 연사:</strong> The repeating crossbow (whether heavy or light) holds 5 crossbow bolts. As long
          as it holds bolts, you can reload it by pulling the reloading lever (a free action). Loading a new case of 5
          bolts is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can fire a repeating crossbow with one hand or fire a repeating crossbow in each hand in the same manner
          as you would a normal crossbow of the same size. However, you must fire the weapon with two hands in order to
          use the reloading lever, and you must use two hands to load a new case of bolts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>단검:</strong> You get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a dagger on your body (see
          the Sleight of Hand skill).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>철퇴, 삼절:</strong> A dire flail is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two
          weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons,
          just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A creature wielding a dire flail in one hand
          can’t use it as a double weapon— only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.
        </p>
        <p>
          When using a dire flail, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the
          opposed attack roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can
          drop the dire flail to avoid being tripped.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>철퇴/무거운 철퇴:</strong> With a flail, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an
          enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can
          drop the flail to avoid being tripped.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>건틀릿:</strong> This metal glove lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with
          unarmed strikes. A strike with a gauntlet is otherwise considered an unarmed attack. The cost and weight given
          are for a single gauntlet. Medium and heavy armors (except breastplate) come with gauntlets.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>건틀릿, 가시:</strong> Your opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm you of spiked gauntlets. The
          cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. An attack with a spiked gauntlet is considered an armed
          attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>글레이브:</strong> A glaive has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can’t
          use it against an adjacent foe.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>기삼:</strong> A guisarme has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can’t use
          it against an adjacent foe.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also use it to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the
          guisarme to avoid being tripped.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>할버드:</strong> If you use a ready action to set a halberd against a charge, you deal double damage
          on a successful hit against a charging character.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use a halberd to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the
          halberd to avoid being tripped.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>망치, 노움 갈고리:</strong> A gnome hooked hammer is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if
          fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting
          with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. The hammer’s blunt head is
          a bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage (crit x3). Its hook is a piercing weapon that deals 1d4
          points of damage (crit x4). You can use either head as the primary weapon. The other head is the offhand
          weapon. A creature wielding a gnome hooked hammer in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of
          the weapon can be used in any given round.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use a gnome hooked hammer to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you
          can drop the gnome hooked hammer to avoid being tripped.
        </p>
        <p>Gnomes treat gnome hooked hammers as martial weapons.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>투창:</strong> Since it is not designed for melee, you are treated as nonproficient with it and take a
          –4 penalty on attack rolls if you use a javelin as a melee weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>낫:</strong> The kama is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a kama special
          options.

          kama to avoid being tripped.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>랜스:</strong> A lance deals double damage when used from the back of a charging mount. It has reach,
          so you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can’t use it against an adjacent foe.
        </p>
        <p>While mounted, you can wield a lance with one hand.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>롱보우:</strong> You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. A longbow is too
          unwieldy to use while you are mounted. If you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when
          you use a longbow. If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls when you use a
          composite longbow (see below) but not a regular longbow.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>롱보우, 합성궁:</strong> You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use
          a composite longbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is,
          each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency). If your Strength bonus is less than the
          strength rating of the composite bow, you can’t effectively use it, so you take a –2 penalty on attacks with
          it. The default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A
          composite longbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength
          score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the
          bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>롱스피어:</strong> A longspear has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can’t
          use it against an adjacent foe. If you use a ready action to set a longspear against a charge, you deal double
          damage on a successful hit against a charging character.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>그물:</strong> A net is used to entangle enemies. When you throw a net, you make a ranged touch attack
          against your target. A net’s maximum range is 10 feet. If you hit, the target is entangled. An entangled
          creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty on Dexterity, can move at only half speed, and
          cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding on an opposed Strength check while
          holding it, the entangled creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows. If the entangled
          creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make a DC 15 Concentration check or be unable to cast the spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          An entangled creature can escape with a DC 20 Escape Artist check (a full-round action). The net has 5 hit
          points and can be burst with a DC 25 Strength check (also a full-round action).
        </p>
        <p>A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of you.</p>
        <p>
          A net must be folded to be thrown effectively. The first time you throw your net in a fight, you make a normal
          ranged touch attack roll. After the net is unfolded, you take a –4 penalty on attack rolls with it. It takes 2
          rounds for a proficient user to fold a net and twice that long for a nonproficient one to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>쌍절곤:</strong> The nunchaku is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a
          nunchaku special options. With a nunchaku, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy
          (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>육척봉:</strong> A quarterstaff is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two
          weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons,
          just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A creature wielding a quarterstaff in one
          hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.
        </p>
        <p>
          The quarterstaff is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a quarterstaff special
          options.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>랜서:</strong> A ranseur has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can’t use
          it against an adjacent foe.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a ranseur, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to
          avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>레이피어:</strong> You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of
          your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a rapier sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon for
          you. You can’t wield a rapier in two hands in order to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus to damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>사이:</strong> With a sai, you get a +4 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy
          (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).
        </p>
        <p>The sai is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a sai special options.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>대낫:</strong> A scythe can be used to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip
          attempt, you can drop the scythe to avoid being tripped.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>방패, 무거움/가벼움:</strong> You can bash with a shield instead of using it for defense. See Armor
          for details.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>숏보우:</strong> You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a
          shortbow while mounted. If you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a
          shortbow. If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite
          shortbow (see below) but not a regular shortbow.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>숏보우, 합성궁:</strong> You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use
          a composite shortbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is,
          each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency). If your Strength bonus is lower than the
          strength rating of the composite bow, you can’t effectively use it, so you take a –2 penalty on attacks with
          it. The default composite shortbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A
          composite shortbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength
          score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the
          bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 75 gp to its cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite shortbow is treated as if it were a
          shortbow.
        </p>
        <p><strong>숏스피어:</strong> A shortspear is small enough to wield one-handed. It may also be thrown.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>수리검:</strong> A shuriken is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding shuriken
          special options. A shuriken can’t be used as a melee weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them,
          crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them and what happens to them after they are thrown.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>샹함:</strong> The siangham is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a
          siangham special options.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>갈고리낫:</strong> A sickle can be used to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip
          attempt, you can drop the sickle to avoid being tripped.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>무릿매:</strong> Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a sling, just as it does
          for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a move action that
          requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an
          attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you
          take a –1 penalty on attack rolls.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>창:</strong> A spear can be thrown. If you use a ready action to set a spear against a charge, you
          deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>가시 갑옷:</strong> You can outfit your armor with spikes, which can deal damage in a grapple or as a
          separate attack. See Armor for details.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>가시 방패, 무거움/가벼움:</strong> You can bash with a spiked shield instead of using it for defense.
          See Armor for details.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>타격, 비무장:</strong> A Medium character deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike.
          A Small character deals 1d2 points of nonlethal damage. A monk or any character with the Improved Unarmed
          Strike feat can deal lethal or nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes, at her option. The damage from an
          unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus on weapon damage
          rolls.
        </p>
        <p>
          An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon. Therefore, you can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply
          your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an unarmed strike.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>검, 바스타드:</strong> A bastard sword is too large to use in one hand without special training; thus,
          it is an exotic weapon. A character can use a bastard sword two-handed as a martial weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>검, 쌍날:</strong> A two-bladed sword is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with
          two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two
          weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A creature wielding a two-bladed
          sword in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>삼지창:</strong> This weapon can be thrown. If you use a ready action to set a trident against a
          charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>어그로시, 드워프:</strong> A dwarven urgrosh is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting
          with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two
          weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. The urgrosh’s axe head is a
          slashing weapon that deals 1d8 points of damage. Its spear head is a piercing weapon that deals 1d6 points of
          damage. You can use either head as the primary weapon. The other is the off-hand weapon. A creature wielding a
          dwarven urgrosh in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be used in any
          given round.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you use a ready action to set an urgrosh against a charge, you deal double damage if you score a hit
          against a charging character. If you use an urgrosh against a charging character, the spear head is the part
          of the weapon that deals damage.
        </p>
        <p>Dwarves treat dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>전투도끼, 드워프:</strong> A dwarven waraxe is too large to use in one hand without special training;
          thus, it is an exotic weapon. A Medium character can use a dwarven waraxe two-handed as a martial weapon, or a
          Large creature can use it one-handed in the same way. A dwarf treats a dwarven waraxe as a martial weapon even
          when using it in one hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>채찍:</strong> A whip deals nonlethal damage. It deals no damage to any creature with an armor bonus
          of +1 or higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher. The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15-foot
          reach, though you don’t threaten the area into which you can make an attack. In addition, unlike most other
          weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes).
        </p>
        <p>Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a ranged weapon.</p>
        <p>
          You can make trip attacks with a whip. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the whip
          to avoid being tripped.
        </p>
        <p>
          When using a whip, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll
          to keep from being disarmed if the attack fails).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to
          attack rolls with a whip sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon for you.
        </p>

      <section id="h2-9-masterwork-weapons">
        <h2>명품 무기</h2>
        <p>
          A masterwork weapon is a finely crafted version of a normal weapon. Wielding it provides a +1 enhancement
          bonus on attack rolls.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can’t add the masterwork quality to a weapon after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork
          weapon (see the Craft skill). The masterwork quality adds 300 gp to the cost of a normal weapon (or 6 gp to
          the cost of a single unit of ammunition). Adding the masterwork quality to a double weapon costs twice the
          normal increase (+600 gp).
        </p>
        <p>
          Masterwork ammunition is damaged (effectively destroyed) when used. The enhancement bonus of masterwork
          ammunition does not stack with any enhancement bonus of the projectile weapon firing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          All magic weapons are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality. The enhancement bonus granted by
          the masterwork quality doesn’t stack with the enhancement bonus provided by the weapon’s magic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though some types of armor and shields can be used as weapons, you can’t create a masterwork version of
          such an item that confers an enhancement bonus on attack rolls. Instead, masterwork armor and shields have
          lessened armor check penalties.

      <h1>갑옷</h1>
      <section id="h2-11-armor-qualities">
        <h2>갑옷 품질</h2>
        <p>
          To wear heavier armor effectively, a character can select the Armor Proficiency feats, but most classes are
          automatically proficient with the armors that work best for them.
        </p>
        <p>Armor and shields can take damage from some types of attacks.</p>
        <p>Here is the format for armor entries (given as column headings on Table: Armor and Shields, below).</p>
        <p>
          <strong>비용:</strong> The cost of the armor for Small or Medium humanoid creatures. See Armor for Unusual
          Creatures, below, for armor prices for other creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>갑옷/방패 보너스:</strong> Each armor grants an armor bonus to AC, while shields grant a shield bonus
          to AC. The armor bonus from a suit of armor doesn’t stack with other effects or items that grant an armor
          bonus. Similarly, the shield bonus from a shield doesn’t stack with other effects that grant a shield bonus.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>최대 민 보너스:</strong> This number is the maximum Dexterity bonus to AC that this type of armor
          allows. Heavier armors limit mobility, reducing the wearer’s ability to dodge blows. This restriction doesn’t
          affect any other Dexterity-related abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if a character’s Dexterity bonus to AC drops to 0 because of armor, this situation does not count as
          losing a Dexterity bonus to AC.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your character’s encumbrance (the amount of gear he or she carries) may also restrict the maximum Dexterity
          bonus that can be applied to his or her Armor Class.
        </p>
        <p><em>방패:</em> Shields do not affect a character’s maximum Dexterity bonus.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>갑옷 판정 페널티:</strong> Any armor heavier than leather hurts a character’s ability to use some
          skills. An armor check penalty number is the penalty that applies to Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide,
          Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand, and Tumble checks by a character wearing a certain kind of armor. Double
          the normal armor check penalty is applied to Swim checks. A character’s encumbrance (the amount of gear
          carried, including armor) may also apply an armor check penalty.
        </p>
        <p><em>방패:</em> If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, both armor check penalties apply.</p>
        <p>
          <em>비숙련된 갑옷 착용:</em> A character who wears armor and/or uses a shield with which he or she is not
          proficient takes the armor’s (and/or shield’s) armor check penalty on attack rolls and on all Strength-based
          and Dexterity-based ability and skill checks. The penalty for nonproficiency with armor stacks with the
          penalty for nonproficiency with shields.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>갑옷 입고 잠 자기:</em> A character who sleeps in medium or heavy armor is automatically fatigued the next
          day. He or she takes a –2 penalty on Strength and Dexterity and can’t charge or run. Sleeping in light armor
          does not cause fatigue.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>비전 주문 실패:</strong> Armor interferes with the gestures that a spellcaster must make to cast an
          arcane spell that has a somatic component. Arcane spellcasters face the possibility of arcane spell failure if
          they’re wearing armor. Bards can wear light armor without incurring any arcane spell failure chance for their
          bard spells.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>갑옷 입고 비전 주문 시전:</em> A character who casts an arcane spell while wearing armor must usually make
          an arcane spell failure roll. The number in the Arcane Spell Failure Chance column on Table: Armor and Shields
          is the chance that the spell fails and is ruined. If the spell lacks a somatic component, however, it can be
          cast with no chance of arcane spell failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>방패:</em> If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, add the two numbers together to get a
          single arcane spell failure chance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>속도:</strong> Medium or heavy armor slows the wearer down. The number on Table: Armor and Shields is
          the character’s speed while wearing the armor. Humans, elves, half-elves, and half-orcs have an unencumbered
          speed of 30 feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          They use the first column. Dwarves, gnomes, and halflings have an unencumbered speed of 20 feet. They use the
          second column. Remember, however, that a dwarf ’s land speed remains 20 feet even in medium or heavy armor or
          when carrying a medium or heavy load.
        </p>
        <p><em>방패:</em> Shields do not affect a character’s speed.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>무게:</strong> This column gives the weight of the armor sized for a Medium wearer. Armor fitted for
          Small characters weighs half as much, and armor for Large characters weighs twice as much.

        <h2>갑옷 설명</h2>
        <p>
          Any special benefits or accessories to the types of armor found on Table: Armor and Shields are described
          below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>갑옷 가시:</strong> You can have spikes added to your armor, which allow you to deal extra piercing
          damage (see Table: Weapons) on a successful grapple attack. The spikes count as a martial weapon. If you are
          not proficient with them, you take a –4 penalty on grapple checks when you try to use them. You can also make
          a regular melee attack (or off-hand attack) with the spikes, and they count as a light weapon in this case.
          (You can’t also make an attack with armor spikes if you have already made an attack with another off-hand
          weapon, and vice versa.)
        </p>
        <p>
          An enhancement bonus to a suit of armor does not improve the spikes’ effectiveness, but the spikes can be made
          into magic weapons in their own right.
        </p>
        <p><strong>띠매듭 갑옷:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
        <p><strong>가슴보호갑:</strong> It comes with a helmet and greaves.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>버클러:</strong> This small metal shield is worn strapped to your forearm. You can use a bow or
          crossbow without penalty while carrying it. You can also use your shield arm to wield a weapon (whether you
          are using an off-hand weapon or using your off hand to help wield a two-handed weapon), but you take a –1
          penalty on attack rolls while doing so. This penalty stacks with those that may apply for fighting with your
          off hand and for fighting with two weapons. In any case, if you use a weapon in your off hand, you don’t get
          the buckler’s AC bonus for the rest of the round.
        </p>
        <p>You can’t bash someone with a buckler.</p>
        <p><strong>사슬 조끼:</strong> A chain shirt comes with a steel cap.</p>
        <p><strong>사슬 갑옷:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>판금:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and a thick layer
          of padding that is worn underneath the armor. Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its owner
          by a master armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a new owner at a cost of 200 to 800
          (2d4x100) gold pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>건틀릿, 고정형:</strong> This armored gauntlet has small chains and braces that allow the wearer to
          attach a weapon to the gauntlet so that it cannot be dropped easily. It provides a +10 bonus on any roll made
          to keep from being disarmed in combat. Removing a weapon from a locked gauntlet or attaching a weapon to a
          locked gauntlet is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The price given is for a single locked gauntlet. The weight given applies only if you’re wearing a
          breastplate, light armor, or no armor. Otherwise, the locked gauntlet replaces a gauntlet you already have as
          part of the armor.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the gauntlet is locked, you can’t use the hand wearing it for casting spells or employing skills. (You
          can still cast spells with somatic components, provided that your other hand is free.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Like a normal gauntlet, a locked gauntlet lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with an
          unarmed strike.
        </p>
        <p><strong>약식 판금:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
        <p><strong>미늘갑옷:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>방패, 무거움, 목제/철제:</strong> You strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A
          heavy shield is so heavy that you can’t use your shield hand for anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>목제/철제:</em> Wooden and steel shields offer the same basic protection, though they respond differently
          to special attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>방패 밀어내기 공격:</em> You can bash an opponent with a heavy shield, using it as an off-hand weapon. See
          Table: Weapons for the damage dealt by a shield bash. Used this way, a heavy shield is a martial bludgeoning
          weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a heavy shield as a one-handed weapon. If you use
          your shield as a weapon, you lose its AC bonus until your next action (usually until the next round). An
          enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but the shield
          can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>방패, 가벼움, 목제/철제:</strong> You strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A
          light shield’s weight lets you carry other items in that hand, although you cannot use weapons with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>목제/철제:</em> Wooden and steel shields offer the same basic protection, though they respond differently
          to special attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>방패 밀어내기 공격:</em> You can bash an opponent with a light shield, using it as an off-hand weapon. See
          Table: Weapons for the damage dealt by a shield bash. Used this way, a light shield is a martial bludgeoning
          weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a light shield as a light weapon. If you use your
          shield as a weapon, you lose its AC bonus until your next action (usually until the next round). An
          enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but the shield
          can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>방패, 장방패:</strong> This massive wooden shield is nearly as tall as you are. In most situations, it
          provides the indicated shield bonus to your AC. However, you can instead use it as total cover, though you
          must give up your attacks to do so. The shield does not, however, provide cover against targeted spells; a
          spellcaster can cast a spell on you by targeting the shield you are holding. You cannot bash with a tower
          shield, nor can you use your shield hand for anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          When employing a tower shield in combat, you take a –2 penalty on attack rolls because of the shield’s
          encumbrance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>방패 가시:</strong> When added to your shield, these spikes turn it into a martial piercing weapon
          that increases the damage dealt by a shield bash as if the shield were designed for a creature one size
          category larger than you. You can’t put spikes on a buckler or a tower shield. Otherwise, attacking with a
          spiked shield is like making a shield bash attack (see above).
        </p>
        <p>
          An enhancement bonus on a spiked shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but
          a spiked shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.
        </p>
        <p><strong>찰갑형 갑옷:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="h2-13-masterwork-armor">
        <h2>명품 갑옷</h2>
        <p>
          Just as with weapons, you can purchase or craft masterwork versions of armor or shields. Such a well-made item
          functions like the normal version, except that its armor check penalty is lessened by 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          A masterwork suit of armor or shield costs an extra 150 gp over and above the normal cost for that type of
          armor or shield.
        </p>
        <p>
          The masterwork quality of a suit of armor or shield never provides a bonus on attack or damage rolls, even if
          the armor or shield is used as a weapon.
        </p>
        <p>All magic armors and shields are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality.</p>
        <p>
          You can’t add the masterwork quality to armor or a shield after it is created; it must be crafted as a
          masterwork item.
        </p>

        <h2>비표준 규격 갑옷</h2>
        <p>
          Armor and shields for unusually big creatures, unusually little creatures, and nonhumanoid creatures have
          different costs and weights from those given on Table: Armor and Shields. Refer to the appropriate line on the
          table below and apply the multipliers to cost and weight for the armor type in question.

          <strong>장착:</strong> This column tells how long it takes a character to put the armor on. (One minute is 10
          rounds.) Readying (strapping on) a shield is only a move action.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>빠른 장착:</strong> This column tells how long it takes to put the armor on in a hurry. The armor
          check penalty and armor bonus for hastily donned armor are each 1 point worse than normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>탈착:</strong> This column tells how long it takes to get the armor off. Loosing a shield (removing it
          from the arm and dropping it) is only a move action.

        <h2>모험 장비</h2>
        <p>
          few of the pieces of adventuring gear found on Table: Goods and Services are described below, along with any
          special benefits they confer on the user (“you”).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>마름쇠:</strong> A caltrop is a four-pronged iron spike crafted so that one prong faces up no matter
          how the caltrop comes to rest. You scatter caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them
          or are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2- pound bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such
          an area), it might step on one. The caltrops make an attack roll (base attack bonus +0) against the creature.
          For this attack, the creature’s shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not count. If the creature is wearing
          shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to AC. If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the creature
          has stepped on one. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature’s speed is reduced by one-half
          because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, or until the creature is successfully
          treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical curing. A charging or
          running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower
          can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.
        </p>
        <p>Caltrops may not be effective against unusual opponents.</p>
        <p><strong>양초:</strong> A candle dimly illuminates a 5-foot radius and burns for 1 hour.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>사슬:</strong> Chain has hardness 10 and 5 hit points. It can be burst with a DC 26 Strength check.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>쇠지레:</strong> A crowbar it grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made for such
          purposes. If used in combat, treat a crowbar as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage
          equal to that of a club of its size.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>부싯돌과 부싯깃:</strong> Lighting a torch with flint and steel is a full-round action, and lighting
          any other fire with them takes at least that long.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>그래플링 훅:</strong> Throwing a grappling hook successfully requires a Use Rope check (DC 10, +2 per
          10 feet of distance thrown).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>망치:</strong> If a hammer is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals
          bludgeoning damage equal to that of a spiked gauntlet of its size.
        </p>
        <p><strong>잉크:</strong> This is black ink. You can buy ink in other colors, but it costs twice as much.</p>
        <p><strong>토기:</strong> This basic ceramic jug is fitted with a stopper and holds 1 gallon of liquid.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>램프, 평범함:</strong> A lamp clearly illuminates a 15-foot radius, provides shadowy illumination out
          to a 30-foot radius, and burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a lamp in one hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>랜턴, 방향성:</strong> A bullseye lantern provides clear illumination in a 60-foot cone and shadowy
          illumination in a 120-foot cone. It burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a bullseye lantern in
          one hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>랜턴, 지붕있음:</strong> A hooded lantern clearly illuminates a 30-foot radius and provides shadowy
          illumination in a 60-foot radius. It burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a hooded lantern in one
          hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>자물쇠:</strong> The DC to open a lock with the Open Lock skill depends on the lock’s quality: simple
          (DC 20), average (DC 25), good (DC 30), or superior (DC 40).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>수갑 및 수갑, 명품:</strong> Manacles can bind a Medium creature. A manacled creature can use the
          Escape Artist skill to slip free (DC 30, or DC 35 for masterwork manacles). Breaking the manacles requires a
          Strength check (DC 26, or DC 28 for masterwork manacles). Manacles have hardness 10 and 10 hit points.
        </p>
        <p>Most manacles have locks; add the cost of the lock you want to the cost of the manacles.</p>
        <p>For the same cost, you can buy manacles for a Small creature.</p>
        <p>
          For a Large creature, manacles cost ten times the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, one hundred times
          this amount. Gargantuan, Colossal, Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine creatures can be held only by specially made
          manacles.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>기름:</strong> A pint of oil burns for 6 hours in a lantern. You can use a flask of oil as a splash
          weapon. Use the rules for alchemist’s fire, except that it takes a full round action to prepare a flask with a
          fuse. Once it is thrown, there is a 50% chance of the flask igniting successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can pour a pint of oil on the ground to cover an area 5 feet square, provided that the surface is smooth.
          If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 1d3 points of fire damage to each creature in the area.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>램, 휴대용:</strong> This iron-shod wooden beam gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks
          made to break open a door and it allows a second person to help you without having to roll, increasing your
          bonus by 2.

        <p>
          <strong>밧줄, 비단:</strong> This rope has 4 hit points and can be burst with a DC 24 Strength check. It is so
          supple that it provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Use Rope checks.

        <p><strong>작은 망원경:</strong> Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>횃불:</strong> A torch burns for 1 hour, clearly illuminating a 20-foot radius and providing shadowy
          illumination out to a 40- foot radius. If a torch is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised
          weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>바이알병:</strong> A vial holds 1 ounce of liquid. The stoppered container usually is no more than 1
          inch wide and 3 inches high.

        <p>
          Any of these substances except for the everburning torch and holy water can be made by a character with the
          Craft (alchemy) skill.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>산:</strong> You can throw a flask of acid as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch
          attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Every creature within
          5 feet of the point where the acid hits takes 1 point of acid damage from the splash.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>연금술사의 불:</strong> You can throw a flask of alchemist’s fire as a splash weapon. Treat this
          attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          A direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits
          takes 1 point of fire damage from the splash. On the round following a direct hit, the target takes an
          additional 1d6 points of damage. If desired, the target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish
          the flames before taking this additional damage. Extinguishing the flames requires a DC 15 Reflex save.
          Rolling on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or magically
          extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>해독제:</strong> If you drink antitoxin, you get a +5 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saving throws
          against poison for 1 hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>영원히 불타는 횃불:</strong> This otherwise normal torch has a <i>continual flame</i> spell cast upon
          it. An everburning torch clearly illuminates a 20-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination out to a
          40-foot radius.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>성스러운 물:</strong> Holy water damages undead creatures and evil outsiders almost as if it were
          acid. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a splash weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against
          the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, you must open the flask and
          pour the holy water out onto the target. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature with holy water only if
          you are adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an undead creature or an evil outsider.
          Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.
        </p>
        <p>Temples to good deities sell holy water at cost (making no profit).</p>
        <p>
          <strong>연막막대:</strong> This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, opaque smoke when
          ignited. The smoke fills a 10- foot cube (treat the effect as a <i>fog cloud</i> spell, except that a moderate
          or stronger wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round). The stick is consumed after 1 round, and the smoke
          dissipates naturally.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>태양막대:</strong> This 1-foot-long, gold-tipped, iron rod glows brightly when struck. It clearly
          illuminates a 30-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination in a 60-foot radius. It glows for 6 hours,
          after which the gold tip is burned out and worthless.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>탱글풋 주머니:</strong> When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a
          range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and the goo bursts out, entangling the target and then
          becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An entangled creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls
          and a –4 penalty to Dexterity and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even
          on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot
          bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be unable to fly
          (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.
        </p>
        <p>
          A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17 Strength check or by
          dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or
          another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which
          the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature
          can move (including flying) at half speed. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by the goo must
          make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds,
          cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of <i>universal solvent</i> to a stuck creature
          dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>뇌석:</strong> You can throw this stone as a ranged attack with a range increment of 20 feet. When it
          strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), it creates a deafening bang that is treated as a sonic attack.
          Each creature within a 10-foot-radius spread must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 hour. A
          deafened creature, in addition to the obvious effects, takes a –4 penalty on initiative and has a 20% chance
          to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal component that it tries to cast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since you don’t need to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at a particular 5-foot square. Treat the
          target square as AC 5.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>부싯불쏘시개:</strong> The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when
          struck against a rough surface. Creating a flame with a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with
          flint and steel (or a magnifying glass) and tinder. Lighting a torch with a tindertwig is a standard action
          (rather than a full-round action), and lighting any other fire with one is at least a standard action.

          related to the Craft (alchemy) skill. Without this lab, a character with the Craft (alchemy) skill is assumed
          to have enough tools to use the skill but not enough to get the +2 bonus that the lab provides.

          <em>부정함의 상징:</em> An unholy symbol is like a holy symbol except that it focuses negative energy and is

        </p>

          <strong>돋보기:</strong> This simple lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a
          substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as
          bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and at least a full-round action. A magnifying glass grants a
          +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>주문책, 마법사의 (공백):</strong> A spellbook has 100 pages of parchment, and each spell takes up one

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>도둑질 도구:</strong> This kit contains the tools you need to use the Disable Device and Open Lock

        <h2>승마와 승마에 관련된 장비</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>마갑, 중형 생명체 및 대형 생명체:</strong> Barding is a type of armor that covers the head, neck,
          chest, body, and possibly legs of a horse or other mount. Barding made of medium or heavy armor provides
          better protection than light barding, but at the expense of speed. Barding can be made of any of the armor
          types found on Table: Armor and Shields.
        </p>
        <p>
          Armor for a horse (a Large nonhumanoid creature) costs four times as much as armor for a human (a Medium
          humanoid creature) and also weighs twice as much as the armor found on Table: Armor and Shields (see Armor for
          Unusual Creatures). If the barding is for a pony or other Medium mount, the cost is only double, and the
          weight is the same as for Medium armor worn by a humanoid. Medium or heavy barding slows a mount that wears
          it, as shown on the table below.

          <strong>개, 탈것:</strong> This Medium dog is specially trained to carry a Small humanoid rider. It is brave

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>당나귀/노새:</strong> Donkeys and mules are stolid in the face of danger, hardy, surefooted, and
          capable of carrying heavy loads over vast distances. Unlike a horse, a donkey or a mule is willing (though not
          eager) to enter dungeons and other strange or threatening places.

        <p>
          <strong>먹이 주기:</strong> Horses, donkeys, mules, and ponies can graze to sustain themselves, but providing

          <strong>말:</strong> A horse (other than a pony) is suitable as a mount for a human, dwarf, elf, half-elf, or
          half-orc. A pony is smaller than a horse and is a suitable mount for a gnome or halfling.
        </p>

        <p>Sometimes the best solution for a problem is to hire someone else to take care of it.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>승용마차:</strong> The price given is for a ride in a coach that transports people (and light cargo)
          between towns. For a ride in a cab that transports passengers within a city, 1 copper piece usually takes you
          anywhere you need to go.
        </p>

          <strong>고용인, 숙달됨:</strong> The amount given is the typical daily wage for mercenary warriors, masons,
          craftsmen, scribes, teamsters, and other trained hirelings. This value represents a minimum wage; many such
          hirelings require significantly higher pay.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>고용인, 미숙함:</strong> The amount shown is the typical daily wage for laborers, porters, cooks,
          maids, and other menial workers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>배달부:</strong> This entry includes horse-riding messengers and runners. Those willing to carry a
          message to a place they were going anyway may ask for only half the indicated amount.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>도로나 관문 통행료:</strong> A toll is sometimes charged to cross a well-trodden, well-kept, and
          well-guarded road to pay for patrols on it and for its upkeep. Occasionally, a large walled city charges a
          toll to enter or exit (or sometimes just to enter).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>뱃삯:</strong> Most ships do not specialize in passengers, but many have the capability to take a few
          along when transporting cargo. Double the given cost for creatures larger than Medium or creatures that are
          otherwise difficult to bring aboard a ship.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>주문:</strong> The indicated amount is how much it costs to get a spellcaster to cast a spell for you.
          This cost assumes that you can go to the spellcaster and have the spell cast at his or her convenience
          (generally at least 24 hours later, so that the spellcaster has time to prepare the spell in question). If you
          want to bring the spellcaster somewhere to cast a spell you need to negotiate with him or her, and the default
          answer is no.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cost given is for a spell with no cost for a material component or focus component and no XP cost. If the
          spell includes a material component, add the cost of that component to the cost of the spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the spell has a focus component (other than a divine focus), add 1/10 the cost of that focus to the cost of
          the spell. If the spell has an XP cost, add 5 gp per XP lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, if a spell has dangerous consequences, the spellcaster will certainly require proof that you can
          and will pay for dealing with any such consequences (that is, assuming that the spellcaster even agrees to
          cast such a spell, which isn’t certain). In the case of spells that transport the caster and characters over a
          distance, you will likely have to pay for two castings of the spell, even if you aren’t returning with the
          caster.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, not every town or village has a spellcaster of sufficient level to cast any spell. In general,
          you must travel to a small town (or larger settlement) to be reasonably assured of finding a spellcaster
          capable of casting 1st-level spells, a large town for 2nd-level spells, a small city for 3rd- or 4th-level
          spells, a large city for 5th- or 6th-level spells, and a metropolis for 7th- or 8th-level spells. Even a
          metropolis isn’t guaranteed to have a local spellcaster able to cast 9th-level spells.
