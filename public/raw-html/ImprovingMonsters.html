      <h1>몬스터 개량하기</h1>
      <p>
        Each of the monster entries describes a typical creature of its kind. However, there are several methods by
        which extraordinary or unique monsters can be created using a typical creature as the foundation: by adding
        character classes, increasing a monster’s Hit Dice, or by adding a template to a monster. These methods are not
        mutually exclusive—it’s possible for a monster with a template to be improved by both increasing its Hit Dice
        and adding character class levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>직업 레벨:</strong> Intelligent creatures that are reasonably humanoid in shape most commonly advance by
        adding class levels. Creatures that fall into this category have an entry of “By character class” in their
        Advancement line. When a monster adds a class level, that level usually represents an increase in experience and
        learned skills and capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>히트 다이스 증가:</strong> Intelligent creatures that are not humanoid in shape, and nonintelligent
        monsters, can advance by increasing their Hit Dice. Creatures with increased Hit Dice are usually superior
        specimens of their race, bigger and more powerful than their run-of-the-mill fellows.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>템플릿:</strong> Both intelligent and nonintelligent creatures with an unusual heritage or an inflicted
        change in their essential nature may be modified with a template. Templates usually result in tougher monsters
        with capabilities that differ from those of their common kin.
      </p>
      <p>Each of these three methods for improving monsters is discussed in more detail below.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="h1-1-ability-score-arrays">
      <h1>능력 점수 배열</h1>
      <p>
        Monsters are assumed to have completely average (or standard) ability scores—a 10 or an 11 in each ability, as
        modified by their racial bonuses. However, improved monsters are individuals and often have better than normal
        ability scores, and usually make use of either the elite array or the nonelite array of ability scores. Monsters
        who improve by adding a template, and monsters who improve by increasing their Hit Dice, may use any of the
        three arrays (standard, nonelite, or elite). Any monster unique enough to be improved could easily be considered
        elite.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>엘리트 배열:</strong> The elite array is 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. While the monster has one weakness
        compared to a typical member of its race, it is significantly better overall. The elite array is most
        appropriate for monsters who add levels in a player character class.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>비 엘리트 배열:</strong> The nonelite array is 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. The nonelite array does not
        necessarily make a monster better than normal, but it does customize the monster as an individual with strengths
        and weaknesses compared to a typical member of its race. The nonelite array is most appropriate for monsters who
        add class levels in a NPC class.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>능력 점수 향상:</strong> Treat monster Hit Dice the same as character level for determining ability
        score increases. This only applies to Hit Dice increases, monsters do not gain ability score increases for
        levels they “already reached” with their racial Hit Dice, since these adjustments are included in their basic
        ability scores.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="h1-2-monsters-and-class-levels">
      <h1>몬스터 및 직업 레벨</h1>
      <p>If a creature acquires a character class, it follows the rules for multiclass characters.</p>
      <p>
        The creature’s Hit Dice equal the number of class levels it has plus its racial Hit Dice. A creature’s “monster
        class” is always a favored class, and the creature never takes XP penalties for having it. Additional Hit Dice
        gained from taking levels in a character class never affect a creature’s size.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>인간형 및 직업 레벨:</strong> Creatures with 1 or less HD replace their monster levels with their
        character levels. The monster loses the attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skills, and feats granted by its 1
        monster HD and gains the attack bonus, save bonuses, skills, feats, and other class abilities of a 1st-level
        character of the appropriate class.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>레벨 보정 및 효율적 캐릭터 레벨:</strong> To determine the effective character level (ECL) of a monster
        character, add its level adjustment to its racial Hit Dice and character class levels. The monster is considered
        to have experience points equal to the minimum needed to be a character of its ECL.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose to equip a monster with gear, use its ECL as its character level for purposes of determining how
        much equipment it can purchase. Generally, only monsters with an Advancement entry of “By character class”
        receive NPC gear; other creatures adding character levels should be treated as monsters of the appropriate CR
        and assigned treasure, not equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>특기 획득 및 능력 점수 올리기:</strong> A monster’s total Hit Dice, not its ECL, govern its acquisition
        of feats and ability score increases.
      </p>

      <h1>히트 다이스 늘리기</h1>
      <p>
        As its Hit Dice increase, a creature’s attack bonuses and saving throw modifiers might improve. It gains more
        feats and skills, depending on its type, as shown on Table: Creature Improvement by Type.
      </p>
      <p>Note that if a creature acquires a character class, it improves according to its class, not its type.</p>

        Certain creatures are created by adding a template to an existing creature. A templated creature can represent a
        freak of nature, the individual creation of a single experimenter, or the first generation of offspring from
        parents of different species.

        <h2>템플릿 상속과 획득</h2>
        <p>
          Some templates can be added to creatures anytime. Templates such as these are referred to as acquired
          templates, indicating that the creature did not always have the attributes of the template.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other templates, known as inherited templates, are part of a creature from the beginning of its existence.
          Creatures are born with these templates.
        </p>
        <p>It’s possible for a certain kind of template to be of either type.</p>

          A template’s description provides a set of instructions for altering an existing creature, known as the base
          creature. The changes that a template might cause to each line of a creature ’s statistics block are discussed
          below. Generally, if a template does not cause a change to a certain statistic, that entry is missing from the
          template description. For clarity, the entry for a statistic or attribute that is not changed is sometimes
          given as “Same as the base creature.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>크기와 유형:</strong> Templates often change a creature’s type, and may change the creature’s size.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a template changes the base creature’s type, the creature also acquires the augmented subtype unless the
          template description indicates otherwise. The augmented subtype is always paired with the creature’s original
          type. Unless a template indicates otherwise, the new creature has the traits of the new type but the features
          of the original type.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a template changes a creature’s size, use Table: Changes to Statistics by Size to calculate changes to
          natural armor, Armor Class, attack rolls, and grapple bonus.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>히트 다이스 및 히트 포인트:</strong> Most templates do not change the number of Hit Dice a monster
          has, but some do. Some templates change the size of a creature’s Hit Dice (usually by changing the creature
          type). A few templates change previously acquired Hit Dice, and continue to change Hit Dice gained with class
          levels, but most templates that change Hit Dice change only the creature’s original HD and leave class Hit
          Dice unchanged.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Hit Dice entry in a template description is missing, Hit Dice and hit points do not change unless the
          creature’s Constitution modifier changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>선제권:</strong> If a template changes the monster’s Dexterity, or if it adds or removes the Improved
          Initiative feat, this entry changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>속도:</strong> If a template modifies a creature’s speed, the template states how that happens. More
          commonly, a template adds a new movement mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>방어도:</strong> If a template changes the creature’s size, see Table: Changes to Statistics by Size
          to determine its new Armor Class and to see whether its natural armor changes. In some cases the method of
          determining Armor Class changes radically; the template description explains how to adjust the creature’s AC.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>기본 공격/그래플:</strong> Templates usually do not change a creature’s base attack bonus. If a
          template modifies a creature’s base attack bonus, the template description states how that happens. Changes to
          a creature’s Strength score can change a creature’s grapple bonus, as can changes to its size.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>공격 및 전력 공격:</strong> Most templates do not change a creature’s attack bonus or modes of attack,
          even when the creature’s type changes (the creature’s base attack bonus is the same as a creature of the
          original type). Of course, any change in ability scores may affect attack bonuses. If Strength or Dexterity
          changes, use the new modifier to determine attack bonuses. A change in a monster’s size also changes its
          attack bonus; see Table: Changes to Statistics by Size.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>피해:</strong> Damage changes with Strength. If the creature uses a two-handed weapon or has a single
          natural weapon, it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to the damage. If it has more than a single attack then
          it adds its Strength bonus to damage rolls for the primary attack and 1/2 its Strength bonus to all secondary
          attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>공간범위/도달범위:</strong> A template may change this entry if it changes the monster’s size. Note
          that this table does not take into account special situations such as exceptional reach.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>특수 공격:</strong> A template may add or remove special attacks. The template description gives the
          details of any special attacks a template provides, including how to determine saving throw DCs, if
          applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>특성:</strong> A template may add or remove special qualities. The template description gives the
          details of any special qualities a template provides, including how to determine saving throw DCs, if
          applicable. Even if the special qualities entry is missing from a template description, the creature still
          gains any qualities associated with its new type.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>기본 내성 굴림:</strong> As with attacks, changing a monster’s type does not always change its base
          saving throw bonuses. You only need to adjust them for new modifiers for Constitution, Dexterity, or Wisdom. A
          template may, however, state that a monster has a different “good” saving throw.
        </p>
        <p><strong>능력:</strong> If a template changes one or more ability scores, these changes are noted here.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>스킬:</strong> As with attacks, changing a monster’s type does not always change its skill points.
          Most templates don’t change the number of Hit Dice a creature has, so you don’t need to adjust skills in that
          case unless the key abilities for those skills have changed, or the template gives a bonus on one or more
          skills, or unless the template gives a feat that provides a bonus on a skill check.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some templates change how skill points are determined, but this change usually only affects skill points
          gained after the template is applied. Treat skills listed in the base creature’s description as class skills,
          as well as any new skills provided by the template.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>특기:</strong> Since most templates do not change the number of Hit Dice a creature has, a template
          will not change the number of feats the creature has. Some templates grant one or more bonus feats.
        </p>
        <p><strong>환경:</strong> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
        <p><strong>집단:</strong> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>도전 지수:</strong> Most templates increase the creature’s Challenge Rating. A template might provide
          a modifier to be added to the base creature’s CR, or it might specify a range of modifiers depending on the
          base creature’s original Hit Dice or CR.
        </p>
        <p><strong>전리품:</strong> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>성향:</strong> Usually the same as the base creature, unless the template is associated with a certain
          alignment.
        </p>
        <p><strong>성장:</strong> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>레벨 보정:</strong> This entry is a modifier to the base creature’s level adjustment. Any level
          adjustment is meaningless unless the creature retains a high enough Intelligence (minimum 3) to gain class
          levels after applying the template.
        </p>

            In theory, there’s no limit to the number of templates you can add to a creature. To add more than one
            template, just apply each template one at a time. Always apply inherited templates before applying acquired
            templates. Whenever you add multiple templates, pay attention to the creature’s type—you may add a template
            that makes the creature ineligible for other templates you might want to add.

        When adding class levels to a creature with 1 or less HD, you advance the creature like a character. Otherwise,
        use the following guidelines.

          If you are advancing a monster by adding player character class levels, decide if the class levels directly
          improve the monster’s existing capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          When adding class levels to a creature, you should give it typical ability scores appropriate for that class.
          Most creatures are built using the standard array of ability scores: 11, 11, 11, 10, 10, 10, adjusted by
          racial modifiers. If you give a creature a PC class use the elite array of ability scores before racial
          adjustments: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. Creatures with NPC classes use the nonelite array of 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8.

            Class levels that increase a monster’s existing strengths are known as associated class levels. Each
            associated class level a monster has increases its CR by 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            Barbarian, fighter, paladin, and ranger are associated classes for a creature that relies on its fighting
            ability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rogue and ranger are associated classes for a creature that relies on stealth to surprise its foes, or on
            skill use to give itself an advantage.
          </p>
          <p>
            A spellcasting class is an associated class for a creature that already has the ability to cast spells as a
            character of the class in question, since the monster’s levels in the spellcasting class stack with its
            innate spellcasting ability.

            If you add a class level that doesn’t directly play to a creature’s strength the class level is considered
            nonassociated, and things get a little more complicated. Adding a nonassociated class level to a monster
            increases its CR by 1/2 per level until one of its nonassociated class levels equals its original Hit Dice.
            At that point, each additional level of the same class or a similar one is considered associated and
            increases the monster’s CR by 1.

          <p>Levels in NPC classes are always treated as nonassociated.</p>

        <p>
          When you improve a monster by adding Hit Dice, use Table: Improved Monster CR Increase to determine the effect
          on the creature’s CR. Keep in mind that many monsters that advance by adding Hit Dice also increase in size.
          Do not stack this CR increase with any increase from class levels. In general, once you’ve doubled a
          creature’s CR, you should closely watch any additional increases in its abilities. Adding Hit Dice to a
          creature improves several of its abilities, and radical increases might not follow this progression
          indefinitely. Compare the monster’s improved attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and any DCs of its special
          abilities from the HD increase to typical characters of the appropriate level and adjust the CR accordingly.

          Generally, increasing a monster’s size increases its combat effectiveness. Large creatures gain increased
          Strength, reach, and other benefits. Apply this modifier if you increase a creature beyond Medium and in
          conjunction with any other increases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be careful, though. Monsters that benefit from a smaller size may actually lose effectiveness because of a
          size increase. Monsters that don’t benefit from size increases don’t advance in that manner for this reason.

      <section id="h2-15-adding-special-abilities">
        <h2>특수 능력 추가하기</h2>
        <p>
          You can add any sort of spell-like, supernatural, or extraordinary ability to a creature. As with a class
          level, you should determine how much, or how little, this ability adds to the creature’s existing repertoire.
          A suite of abilities that work together should be treated as a single modifier for this purpose. If the
          ability (or combination of abilities) significantly increases the monster’s combat effectiveness, increase its
          CR by 2. Minor abilities increase the creature’s CR by 1, and truly trivial abilities may not increase CR at
          all. If the special abilities a monster gains are not tied to a class or Hit Die increase, this CR increase
          stacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          A significant special attack is one that stands a good chance of incapacitating or crippling a character in
          one round. A significant special quality is one that seriously diminishes the monster’s vulnerability to
          common attacks. Do not add this factor twice if a monster has both special attacks and special qualities.
        </p>
        <p>Make sure to “scale” your evaluation of these abilities by the monster’s current CR.</p>
