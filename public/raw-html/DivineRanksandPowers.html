        <h3>신성 등급</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">Divine Ranks</div>
        <p>Each deity has a 신성 rank. A deity의 신성 rank determines how much power the entity has.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Rank 0:</b><span>
            Creatures of this rank are sometimes called quasi-deities or hero deities. Creatures that have a mortal and
            a deity as parents also fall into this category. These entities cannot grant 주문, but are immortal and
            usually have one or more ability</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          scores that are far above the norm for their species. They may have some worshipers. Ordinary mortals do not
          have a 신성 rank of 0. They lack a 신성 rank altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Rank 1–5:</b><span>
            These entities, called demigods, are the weakest of the deities. A demigod can grant 주문 and 공연 a few
            deeds that are beyond mortal limits. A demigod has anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand devoted
            mortal worshipers and may receive veneration or respect from many more. A demigod controls a small godly
            realm (usually on an Outer Plane) and has minor control over a portfolio that includes one or more aspects
            of mortal existence. A demigod might be very accomplished in a single skill or a group of related 스킬, gain
            전투 advantages in special circumstances, or be able to bring about minor changes in reality itself related
            to the portfolio.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Rank 6–10:</b><span>
            Called 하급 deities, these entities grant 주문 and can 공연 more powerful deeds than demigods can. 하급
            deities have anywhere from a few thousand to tens of thousands of worshipers and control larger godly realms
            than demigods. They also have keener senses where their portfolios are concerned.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Rank 11–15:</b><span>
            These entities are called intermediate deities. They have hundreds of thousands of mortal worshipers and
            control larger godly realms than demigods or 하급 deities.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Rank 16–20:</b><span>
            Called 상급 deities, these entities may have millions of mortal worshipers, and they 명령 respect even among
            other deities. The most powerful of 상급 deities rule over other deities just as mortal sovereigns rule over
            평민.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Rank 21+:</b><span>
            These entities are beyond the ken of mortals and care nothing for worshipers. They do not grant 주문, do not
            answer 기도, and do not respond to queries. If they are known at all, it is to a handful of scholars on 물질
            세계. They are called overdeities. In some pantheistic systems, the consent of an overdeity is required to
            become a god.</span><span>25</span>

        <h3>신성 특징</h3>
        <div class="original-headline">Divine Characteristics</div>
        <p>
          Most deities are creatures of the outsider type (usually with 20 outsider 히트 다이스). All deities that are
          outsiders have all 성향 subtypes that 일치 with their 성향.&nbsp; Unlike other outsiders, they have no
          암흑시야 unless noted in the deity 묘사. Deities’ physical characteristics vary from deity to deity. A deity의
          outsider type, along with its class or classes, determines its weapon proficiencies, 특기, and 스킬. Deities
          have some or all of the following additional qualities, depending on their 신성 rank.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>레벨:</b><span>
            Most deities are 20 HD outsiders with 30 to 50 character 레벨 as well. These additional character 레벨
            beyond an effective character 레벨 of 20th follow the rules for 에픽 레벨.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Character 레벨 above 20th confer some, but not all, of the benefits of normal 레벨. Deities gain all 직업 특기
          for all their 레벨. The deity also gains the normal Hit Die for that class, plus additional skill points as if
          the deity had a 레벨 in that class normally. The deity gains an ability 보너스 every four 레벨, and a feat
          every three 레벨.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond character 레벨 20th, deities’ 공격 and 내성 굴림 보너스 increase at new 시궁쥐. Deities gain a +1 에픽
          공격 보너스 at 21st 레벨 and every other 레벨 thereafter. No deity can have more than four 공격 derived
          strictly from its 기본 공격 보너스.&nbsp; Deities also gain a +1 보너스 on 내성 굴림 at 22nd 레벨 and every
          other 레벨 thereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>히트 포인트:</b><span> Deities receive maximum 히트 포인트 for each Hit Die.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>속도:</b><span>
            Deities can 이동 much more quickly than mortals. A deity의 기본 육상 속도 depends on its form (biped or
            quadruped) and its size, as shown on the following table. Some deities are exceptions, with 속도 faster or
            slower than the norm.</span>

        <p>
          Note: Use the Biped column for burrow and 수영 속도 for all deities regardless of form. Use half the value in
          the Biped column for 등반 속도 for all deities. Use twice the value in the Quadruped column for 비행 속도 for
          all deities capable of flying.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>방어도:</b><span>
            A field of 신성 energy encompasses a deity의 body, granting it a 신성 방어도 보너스 equal to its 신성 rank.
            This 보너스 stacks with all other 방어도 보너스 and is effective against touch 공격 and incorporeal touch
            공격.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most deities (all those with 20 outsider 히트 다이스) have a 자연 갑옷 보너스 of their 신성 rank +13. All
          deities also have a deflection 보너스 to their AC equal to their 매력 보너스(if any).
        </p>
        <p>Deities who aren’t outsiders have their normal 자연 갑옷 보너스 + their 신성 rank.</p>
        <p>Many deities have other 방어도 보너스 as noted in their individual 묘사.</p>
        <p>
          <b>공격:</b><span>
            A deity의 히트 다이스 and type and character 레벨 determine its 기본 공격 보너스. In addition to the figures
            for weapon 공격, this section of 수치 표 also includes melee touch 공격 and ranged touch 공격 보너스, to be
            used when the deity casts a spell or uses a 유사주문 ability that requires a touch 공격 to affect its
            target. A deity gets its 신성 rank as a 신성 보너스 on all 명중 굴림. Deities of rank 1 or higher do not
            automatically fail on a natural 명중 굴림 of 1.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Bypassing 피해 축소:</i><span>
            As outsiders with 성향 subtypes, the natural 공격 of deities, as well as any 무기 they wield, are considered
            aligned the same as the deity for 목적 of bypassing 피해 축소.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Always Maximize Roll:</b><span>
            상급 deities (rank 16–20) automatically get the best result possible on any check, 내성 굴림, 명중 굴림, or
            피해 roll. Calculate success, failure, or other effects accordingly. When a 상급 deity makes a check, 공격,
            or save assume a 20 was rolled and calculate success or failure from there. A d20 should still be rolled and
            used to check for a threat of a critical hit.&nbsp; This quality means that 상급 deities never need 주문
            최대화 feat, because their 주문 have maximum effect already.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>내성 굴림:</b><span>
            A deity의 outsider 히트 다이스 and character 레벨 determine its base 내성 굴림 보너스. A deity gets its 신성
            rank as a 신성 보너스 on all 내성 굴림. Deities of rank 1 or higher do not automatically fail on a natural
            내성 굴림 roll of 1.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Checks:</b><span>
            A deity gets its 신성 rank as a 신성 보너스 on all 스킬 판정, 능력 판정, 시전자 레벨 checks, and turning
            checks. 하급 deities (rank 6–10) may take 10 on any check, provided they need to make a check at all.
            Intermediate and 상급 deities (rank 11–20) always get a result of 20 on any check, provided they need to
            make a check at all.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Deities and Synergy 보너스</i><span>: For every 20 extra ranks a deity has in a skill, the deity의 synergy 보너스 from the skill (if any)
            increases by +2.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Immunities:</b><span>
            Deities have the following immunities. Individual deities may have more immunities. Unless otherwise
            indicated, these immunities do not apply if the attacker is a deity of equal or higher rank.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>변환술: </i><span>A deity is immune to polymorphing, petrification, or any other 공격 that alters its form. Any
            shape-altering powers the deity might have work normally on itself.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>정령 흡수, Ability Drain, Ability 피해: </i><span>A deity is not subject to 정령 흡수, ability drain, or ability 피해.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>정신영향계 Effects: </i><span>A deity is immune to 정신영향계 effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale
            effects).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Energy Immunity: </i><span>Deities of rank 1 or higher are immune to electricity, cold, and acid, even if the attacker is a deity of
            higher 신성 rank. Some deities have additional energy immunities.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Deities of rank 1 or higher are immune to 질병 and 독, stunning, 수면, 마비, and death effects, and
          disintegration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deities of rank 6 or higher are immune to effects that imprison or banish them. Such effects include
          <i>추방, 결속, 차원의 닻, 차원 강제퇴거, 감금, 격퇴, 영혼 결속, 시간 동결, 영혼의 덫, </i>and turning and rebuking.
        </p>
        <p><b>피해 축소:</b><span> A deity has 피해 축소 as shown below</span></p>

        </div>
        <p>
          If the deity also has 피해 축소 from another source this 피해 축소 does not stack with 피해 축소 granted by
          신성 등급. Instead, the deity gets the benefit of the best 피해 축소 in a given situation. Whenever a deity
          has a second kind of 피해 축소 that might apply to an 공격, that 피해 축소 is listed in parentheses after the
          피해 축소 entry in the deity의 수치 표.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>저항:</b><span>
            All deities have at least the following 저항.&nbsp; Individual deities may have additional 저항.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>에너지 저항: </i><span>A deity has fire 저항 of 5 + its 신성 rank.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>주문 저항: </i><span>A deity has 주문 저항 of 32 + its 신성 rank.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>특화 신성 능력</b><span>: Every deity of rank 1 or higher has at least one additional power, called a salient 신성 ability, per
            신성 rank (see 특화 신성 능력).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Domain Powers:</b><span>
            A deity of rank 1 or higher can use any domain power it can grant a number of times per day equal to its
            신성 rank (if the power normally can be used more often than that, the deity gets 상급 number of uses). If a
            domain power is based on a 사제의 레벨(or one-half a 사제의 레벨), a deity with no 사제 레벨 has an
            effective 사제 레벨 equal to the deity의 신성 rank (or one-half the deity의 신성 rank) for this 목적.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>유사주문 능력:</b><span>
            A deity can use any domain spell it can grant as a 유사주문 ability at will. The deity의 effective 시전자
            레벨 for such 능력 is 10 + the deity의 신성 rank. 내성 굴림 DC for such 능력 is 10 + the spell 레벨 + the
            deity의 매력 보너스(if any) + the deity의 신성 rank.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Immortality:</b><span>
            All deities (even those of rank 0) are naturally immortal and cannot die from natural causes. Deities do not
            나이, and they do not need to eat, 수면, or breathe. The only way for a deity to die is through special
            circumstances, usually by being slain in magical or physical 전투. Deities of rank 1 or higher are not
            subject to death from massive 피해.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Senses: </b><span>Deities of rank 1 or higher have incredibly sensitive perception. Such a deity의 senses (including 암흑시야
            and 저광시야, if the deity has them) extend out to a radius of one mile per 신성 rank. Perception is limited
            to the senses a deity possesses. </span><span>A deity cannot see through </span><span>solid objects without using its remote sensing ability or some sort of x-ray 시야 power.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Remote Sensing: </i><span>As a standard action, a deity of rank 1 or higher can perceive everything within a radius of one mile per
            rank around any of its worshipers, holy sites, or other objects or locales sacred to the deity. This
            supernatural effect can also be centered on any place where someone 말하기 the deity의 이름 or title for up
            to 1 hour after 이름 is spoken, and at any location when an event related to the deity의 portfolio
            occurs.The remote sensing power can cross 이세계 and penetrate any barrier except a 신성 방패(described in
            특화 신성 능력) or an 범위 otherwise blocked by a deity of equal or higher rank. Remote sensing is not
            fooled by <i>눈속임 </i>or
            <i>탐지방어 </i>or similar 주문, and it does not create a magical sensor
            that other creatures can detect. A deity can extend its senses to two or more remote locations at once
            (depending on 신성 rank) and still sense what의 going on nearby.</span>

          Once a deity chooses a remote location to sense, it automatically receives sensory information from that
          location until it chooses a new location to sense, or until it can’t sense the location.

          <i>Block Sensing: </i><span>As a standard action, a deity of rank 1 or higher can block the sensing ability of other deities of its
            rank or lower. This power extends for a radius of one mile per rank of the deity, or within the same
            distance around a temple or other locale sacred to the deity, or the same distance around a
            portfolio-related event. The deity can block two remote locations at once, plus 범위 within one mile of
            itself. The blockage lasts 1 hour per 신성 rank.</span>

          <i>Portfolio Sense: </i><span>Demigods have a limited ability to sense events involving their portfolios. They automatically sense any
            event that involves one thousand or more people. The ability is limited to the present. 하급 deities
            automatically sense any event that involves their portfolios and affects five hundred or more people.
            Intermediate deities automatically sense any event that involves their portfolios, regardless of the number
            of people involved. In addition, their senses extend one week into the past for every 신성 rank they have.
            상급 deities automatically sense any event that involves their portfolios, regardless of the number of
            people involved. In addition, their senses extend one week into the past and one week into the future for
            every 신성 rank they have. When a deity senses an event, it merely knows that the event is occurring and
            where it is. The deity receives no sensory information about the event. Once a deity notices an event, it
            can use its remote sensing power to perceive the event.</span>

            can resist the aura의 effects with successful Will 내성 굴림; the DC is 10 + the deity의 rank + the deity의
            매력 수정치. Deities are immune to the auras of deities of equal or lower rank. Any being who makes a

            locale dedicated to another deity of equal or higher rank than the deity who is speaking). In the latter
            case, anyone within earshot of the sound can hear it. The deity can send a manifestation or omen instead of
            a spoken or telepathic 통보. The exact nature of this communication varies with the deity, but it usually is
            some visible phenomenon. A deity의 communication power can cross 이세계 and penetrate any barrier. Once
            communication is initiated, the deity can continue communicating as a free action until it decides to end

          Within this 범위, the deity can set any temperature that is normal for the plane where the realm is located
          (for 물질 세계, any temperature from –20ºF to 120ºF), and fill 범위 with 냄새 and sounds as the deity sees
          fit. Sounds can be no louder than one hundred 인간 could make, but not intelligible speech or harmful sound.
          The deity의 ability to create 냄새 is similar. Deities of rank 6 or higher can create the sounds of
          intelligible speech. A demigod or 하급 deity can erect buildings and alter the landscape, but must do so
          through its own labor, through magic, or through its 신의 권능. A deity of rank 6 or higher not only has
          control over 환경, but also controls links to 영적 세계. Manipulating a realm의 astral links renders
          teleportation and similar effects useless within the realm. The deity can designate certain locales within the
          realm where astral links remain intact. Likewise, the deity can block off the realm from planar portals or
          designate locations where portals are possible. A deity of rank 11 or higher can also apply the enhanced magic
          or impeded magic trait to up to four groups of 주문(학파, domains, or 주문 with the same descriptor). The
          enhanced magic trait enables a 메타마법 feat to be applied to a group of 주문 without requiring higher-레벨
          spell slots. Many deities apply the enhanced magic trait to their domain 주문, making them maximized (as the
          주문 최대화 feat) within the boundaries of their realm. The impeded magic trait doesn’t affect the deity의
          주문 and 유사주문 능력.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, a deity of rank 11 or higher can erect buildings as desired and alter terrain within ten miles to
          become any terrain type found on 물질 세계. These buildings and alterations are manifestations of the deity의
          control over the realm.
        </p>
        <p>A 상급 deity (rank 16 or higher) also can 공연 any one of the following acts:</p>
        <p>• Change or apply a gravity trait within the realm.</p>
        <p>• Change or apply an 정령 or energy trait within the realm.</p>
        <p>• Change or apply a time trait within the realm.</p>
        <p>
          • Apply the limited magic trait to a particular 학파, domain, or spell descriptor within 범위, preventing such
          주문 and 유사주문 능력 from functioning. 상급 deity의 own 주문 and 유사주문 능력 are not limited by these
          restrictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a deity sets 상태이상 in its realm, they are permanent, though the deity can change them. As a standard
          action, the deity can specify a new environmental condition. The change gradually takes effect over the next
          10 minutes. Changing astral links, 이세계 속성, or terrain requires more effort, and the deity must labor for
          a year and a day to change them. During this time, the deity must spend 8 hours a day on the project. During
          the remaining 16 hours of each day, the deity can 공연 any action it desires, so long as it remains within the
          realm. The astral links, 이세계 속성, and terrain remain unchanged until the labor is complete.

            A deity of rank 1 or higher can use <i>순간이동 without error </i>as a
            유사주문 ability at will, as the spell cast by a 20th-레벨 character, except that the deity can 운송수단
            only itself and up to 100 pounds of objects per 신성 rank. A deity of rank 6 or higher also can use

          <b>패밀리어:</b><span>
            A deity of rank 1 or higher with 레벨 as a 소서러 or a 마법사 has the ability to treat any creature of a

            deity. This special familiar ability only applies to one creature at a time, but the deity can switch
            between one creature and another instantaneously, as long as the second creature is within 거리. This
            special familiar ability does not replace the deity의 ability to have a normal familiar, which could be any
            kind of eligible creature.</span>
