      <h1>에픽 스킬</h1>
      <p>
        Despite the near-magical nature of some epic level skill uses, all uses of skills are considered exceptional
        abilities (except if noted otherwise), and thus function normally even within areas of antimagic.
      </p>
      <section id="h5-1-skill-synergy">
        <h5>스킬 시너지</h5>
        <p>
          Many skills are noted as granting a synergy bonus to the use of another skill when a character has 5 or more
          ranks in the first skill. This synergy bonus increases by +2 for every additional 20 ranks the character has
          in the skill.

            Spellcraft to learn more about the item as if he or she had already cast <i>detect magic</i> on the item.
            This requires a full-round action.

            <strong>목표물에게 제안 주입시키기:</strong>This is identical to the effect of the <i>suggestion</i> spell,
            except that it is nonmagical and lasts for only 10 minutes. It can be sensed as if it were an enchantment
            effect (Sense Motive DC 25).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>가짜 성향 보여주기:</strong>The character can fool alignment-sensing effects by displaying a false
            alignment of his or her choice. Once set, a false alignment remains as long as the character remains
            conscious and awake. Setting or changing a false alignment requires a full-round action.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>표면적 사념 변장:</strong>The character can fool spells such as <i>detect thoughts</i> (or similar
            effects) by displaying false surface thoughts. While the character can’t completely mask the presence of his
            or her thoughts, he or she can change his or her apparent Intelligence score (and thus the character’s
            apparent mental strength) by as much as 10 points and can place any thought in his or her “surface thoughts”
            to be read by such spells or effects. If a character attempts to use Sense Motive to detect his or her
            surface thoughts (see the Sense Motive skill description), this becomes an opposed check (though any result
            lower than 100 automatically fails).

            <strong>재빠른 등반:</strong>A character can climb his or her speed as a move-equivalent action, or double
            his or her speed as a full-round action (requiring two Climb checks), but the character takes a –20 penalty
            on his or her check.

            <strong>빠른 제작:</strong> A character can voluntarily increase the DC of crafting an item by any multiple
            of 10. This allows the character to create an item more quickly (since he or she will be multiplying this
            higher DC by his or her skill check result to determine progress). The character must decide the increase to
            the DC before making the check.

            character to create alchemical items and substances of greater power than normal. To augment an alchemical
            substance, add +20 to the DC required to create the item and multiply the cost by 5. If the item or
            substance deals damage, double the damage dealt. If the item or substance doesn’t deal damage, double the
            duration of its effect. If the item or substance doesn’t deal damage and doesn’t have a specific listed
            duration (or has an instantaneous duration), double all dimensions of its area. If the item or substance
            doesn’t fit any of these categories, then it cannot be improved in this manner. A character can create an
            item with multiple degrees of augmentation. For every additional multiplier applied to damage, duration, or
            area, add an additional +20 to the DC and add an additional 5 to the cost multiplier.

            Will saves, and a –1 penalty to AC whenever fighting for the character or his or her cause. This attitude
            will remain for one day plus one day per point of the character’s Charisma bonus, at which point the NPC’s
            attitude will revert to its original attitude (or indifferent, if no attitude is specified).
          </p>
          <p>
            Treat the fanatic attitude as a mind-affecting enchantment effect for purposes of immunity, save bonuses, or
            being detected by the Sense Motive skill. Since it is nonmagical, it can’t be dispelled; however, any effect
            that suppresses or counters mind-affecting effects will affect it normally. A fanatic NPC’s attitude can’t
            be further adjusted by the use of skills.

            Will saves, and a –1 penalty to AC whenever fighting for the character or his or her cause. This attitude
            will remain for one day plus one day per point of the character’s Charisma bonus, at which point the NPC’s

            Treat the fanatic attitude as a mind-affecting enchantment effect for purposes of immunity, save bonuses, or

            that suppresses or counters mind-affecting effects will affect it normally. A fanatic NPC’s attitude can’t
            be further adjusted by the use of skills.

            <strong>부분적 성향 눈치 채기:</strong> This use of the skill lets a character discern one component of a
            target’s alignment. When making the check, the character states whether he or she is trying to discern the
            law–chaos or good–evil component. A character can’t retry the check, and he or she can’t use this to discern
            more than one component of the alignment (but see below). The target must be visible and within 30 feet of
            the character.

            <strong>전체 성향 눈치 채기:</strong> This use of the skill lets a character determine both components of a

            the character.

            the 3rd-round effect of the <i>detect thoughts</i> spell). There is no saving throw to resist this effect,
            though the target can use Bluff to disguise his or her surface thoughts (see the Bluff skill description),
            in which case this becomes an opposed check (any result lower than 100 automatically fails). The target must
            be visible and within 30 feet of the character.

            character is capable of tracking, he or she can identify the races of creatures being tracked.

            With a successful check, the character knows the direction to the desired location. This merely points the
            character in the direction of the location; it doesn’t provide him or her with information on how to get
            there, nor does it take into account any obstacles in the path. “Very familiar” represents a place where the
            character has been very often and where he or she feels at home. “Studied carefully” represents a place the
            character knows well, either because he or she has been there often or has used other means to study the
            place. “Seen casually” is a place that the character has viewed more than once, but which he or she has not
            studied. “Viewed once” is a place that the character has seen once, possibly using magic. “Description only”
            is a place whose location and appearance the character knows through someone else’s description.

          <strong>염탐 부수기:</strong> If you determine that you’re being scried, you can make an opposed caster level
          check with the scryer. (Your caster level must be at least 21st to attempt this task.) If you are successful,
          the scrying ends, and the scryer may not target you with a Divination (Scrying) spell or effect for a number
          of hours equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).
