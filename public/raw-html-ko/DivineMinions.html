beings may serve deities. In general, a deity only accepts minions who have
accomplished some great deed in service to the deity. Such minions usually have
the same 성향 as the deity. No minion’s 성향 is opposed to the patron
deity’s 성향 on either the law–chaos axis or the good–evil axis. </p><section id="h3-1-proxies"><h3>대리인</h3><div class="original-headline">Proxies</div><p>A 신성 proxy
말하기 and acts on behalf of the 신성 being. When the 요구 for a deity’s
presence is too high, the deity may use 대리인.</p><p>대리인 are 신성 하수인 invested with a small portion of the deity’s power. A deity may invest
1 rank of its power (reducing its 신성 rank accordingly) in a single servant
for as long as the deity chooses. The minion must be physically present for the
deity to 공연 the investiture. While so invested, the proxy gains any
특화 신성 능력 held by the patron deity as well as the powers and
능력 of a rank 1 demigod. Without the requisite 능력 점수 or 신성 등급, the proxy may not be able to use all those powers and 능력. A deity
may have more than one proxy, but it must lose 1 신성 rank for each proxy it
invests. A deity can 물체 염동 a single 신성 rank as a standard action, and
doing so it does not require the physical presence of the proxy. </p></section><section id="h3-2-petitioners"><h3>소원인</h3><div class="original-headline">Petitioners</div><p>Some spirits
demonstrate their devotion to their deity by traveling to the deity’s home
plane. Those that survive the journey across the 이세계 become servants of
their deity. While a few may remain disembodied spirits, most become
소원인 through the 신성 will of their patron deity. </p><p>In general,
소원인 appear in the form that they had when they died, though they may be
remade by deities to fit the nature of their particular afterlife. In general,
소원인 who become 신성 servants are creatures that originally had at
least 1 지능 and 1 지혜.</p><p>The following
creature types may become 소원인 depending on the deity: aberrations,
animals, 드래곤, fey, 거인, humanoids, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids,
and plants, 늪괴물, and vermin with sufficient 능력 점수. Constructs and
undead are not usually made into 소원인, though the spirits of their
original forms may be. 정령 and outsiders tend to meld with their native
이세계, and as such do not become 소원인. Their spirits may still be
called back from the 죽음, however.</p><p>The template
presented below is for NPCs, not player characters. If 죽음 characters who are
소원인 are later restored to life (once again becoming player characters),
they forget any of their experiences as 소원인.</p></section><section id="h3-3-creating-a-petitioner"><h3>소원인 만들기</h3><div class="original-headline">Creating a Petitioner</div><p>“Petitioner” is a
