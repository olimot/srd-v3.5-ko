danger or 해악 to the subject of the spell. You are never surprised or
flat-footed. In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you
might take to best protect yourself and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and
Reflex 내성 굴림. This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a 민첩
bonus to AC.</p><p>When
another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that
creature. You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the
warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence
of such a warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even
telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished
before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without
지연. The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to AC and Reflex
내성 굴림.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Arcane

No</span></p><p>Casting
a <span style="font-style: italic;">관문 </span>spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional
connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing
travel between those two 이세계 in either direction.</p><p>Second,
you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the <span style="font-style: italic;">관문.</span></p><p>The
<span style="font-style: italic;">관문 </span>itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter
(caster’s choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into
existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window
looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or
anything that 이동 through is shunted instantly to the other side.</p><p>A
<span style="font-style: italic;">관문 </span>has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the <span style="font-style: italic;">관문 </span>from
the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from
the back are not.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Planar
Travel: </span><span>As
a mode of planar travel, a <span style="font-style: italic;">관문 </span>spell functions much like a <span style="font-style: italic;">이세계 전이 </span>spell, except that the <span style="font-style: italic;">관문 </span>opens precisely at the point you
desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm
can prevent a <span style="font-style: italic;">관문 </span>from opening in their presence or personal demesnes
if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you—anyone who chooses to
step through the portal is transported. A <span style="font-style: italic;">관문 </span>cannot be opened to
another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.</span></p><p>You
may hold the <span style="font-style: italic;">관문 </span>open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per
시전자 레벨), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar
connection is severed.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Calling
Creatures: </span><span>The
second effect of the <span style="font-style: italic;">관문 </span>spell is to call an extraplanar creature to
your 보조 (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as
you cast the spell, you cause the <span style="font-style: italic;">관문 </span>to open in the immediate vicinity
of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling.
Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the <span style="font-style: italic;">관문, </span>although
they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a <span style="font-style: italic;">관문
</span>that remains open just long enough to 운송수단 the called creatures. This
use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).</span></p><p>If
you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual you may
call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call
and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your
시전자 레벨. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do
not exceed twice your 시전자 레벨. A single creature with more HD than twice
your 시전자 레벨 can’t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be
controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the
calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to
its home plane at any time.</p><p>A
controlled creature can be commanded to 공연 a service for you. Such
services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service.
Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be
accomplished within 1 round per 시전자 레벨 counts as an immediate task; you
need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature’s help. The
creature departs at the end of the spell.</p><p>If
you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called
creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The
service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or
reward; see the <span style="font-style: italic;">하급 이세계 동료 소환 </span>spell for appropriate rewards. (Some
creatures may want their payment in “livestock” rather than in coin, which
could involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the
being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over
the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to
return to its own plane.</p><p>Failure
to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service
by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the
creature or its kin may 공격 you.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note:
</span><span>When you
use a calling spell such as <span style="font-style: italic;">관문 </span>to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil,
fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">XP
