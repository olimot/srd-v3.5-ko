up to four additional 공격 with these tentacles in addition to your regular
melee 공격 in each round that you take a 전력 공격 action. You can make
tentacle 공격 within the space you normally threaten. If you make your
tentacle 공격 in addition to you regular melee 공격, each tentacle
공격 at your highest base 공격 보너스 with a –5 penalty. If you forgo all
your other 공격, making only tentacle 공격, you make your tentacle
공격 at your highest base 공격 보너스 with no penalty. These tentacles deal
2d8 points of 피해 plus one-half your 근력 bonus on each successful
strike.</p><p>This power

touched subject’s flesh to ripple, grow together, and fuse into a nearly
seamless whole. The subject is forced into a fetal position (if humanoid), with
only the vaguest outline of its folded arms and legs visible below the
all-encompassing wave of flesh. The subject retains the ability to breathe,
eat, and excrete, but may lose the use of its senses (see below). If the sudden
변형 would prove fatal to the creature (such as fusing a swimming airbreathing
subject, or a flying subject), the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save. Unless
it loses the use of its senses (see below), the creature can still 공연
purely mental actions, such as 파워 구현.</p><p>If the target
fails its Fortitude save to avoid the power’s effect, the subject must
immediately attempt a second Fortitude save. If this second save is failed, the
creature’s eyes and ears fuse over, effectively blinding and deafening it.
Moreover, it loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like 능력,
as well as its ability to manifest powers (if any), and is generally in sorry

willing, corporeal, living creature of the same or smaller size fuse into one
being. As the manifester, you control the actions of the fused being. However,
you can give up this control to the other creature. Once you give up control,
you cannot regain it unless the other creature relinquishes it.</p><p>The fused being
has your current 히트 포인트 plus the other creature’s current 히트 포인트. The
fused being knows all the powers you and the other creature know, has the sum
of your and the other creature’s 파워 포인트, and knows or has prepared any
주문 you or the other creature possesses (if any). Likewise, all 특기,
racial 능력, and 직업 특성 are pooled (if both creatures have the
same ability, the fused being gains it only once). For each of the six 능력 점수, the fused being’s score is the higher of yours and the other
creature’s, and the fused being also has the higher 히트 다이스 or 구현자 레벨—this effectively means the fused being uses the better 내성 굴림,
공격 보너스, and skill modifiers of either member, and it manifests powers at
the higher of the 구현자 레벨 that you or the other creature possessed
before becoming fused.</p><p>You decide what
장비 is absorbed into the fused being and what 장비 remains available
for use. These fused items are restored once the power ends.</p><p>When the power
ends, the fused being separates. The other creature appears in an area adjacent
to you that you determine. If separation occurs in a cramped space, the other
creature is expelled through 영적 세계, finally coming to rest materially
in the nearest empty space and taking 1d6 points of 피해 for each 10 feet of
solid material passed through.</p><p>피해 taken by
the fused being is split evenly between you and the other creature when the

entered it with, unless you were damaged prior to the <span style="font-style: italic;">융합 </span>and the
fused being was subsequently healed. In a like manner, the fused being’s
remaining 파워 포인트 are split between you and the other creature (you can
leave with more points than you entered with, as long as you don’t exceed the
maximum 파워 포인트 for your 레벨 and ability score). Ability 피해 and
negative 레벨 are also split between you and the other creature. (If an odd
number of negative 레벨 or ability score reductions must be split, you decide
whether you or the other creature receives the additional loss.)</p><p>If a fused
