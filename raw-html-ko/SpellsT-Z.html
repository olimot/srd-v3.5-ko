Yes (object); see text</span></p><p>You
이동 objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on the version
selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, 공연 a variety of
전투 maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sustained
Force: </span><span>A
sustained force 이동 an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per 시전자 레벨 (maximum 375 pounds at 15th 레벨) up to 20 feet per round. A creature
can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or
with 주문 저항.</span></p><p>This
version of the spell can last 1 round per 시전자 레벨, but it ends if you
cease 집중. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in
both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your 범위. The spell ends if
the object is forced beyond the 범위. If you cease 집중 for any
reason, the object falls or stops.</p><p>An
object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a
lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on,
if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able
to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require
지능 checks.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">전투
Maneuver: </span><span>Alternatively,
once per round, you can use <span style="font-style: italic;">염동력 </span>to 공연 a 황소 쇄도, 무장해제,
드잡이 (including pin), or 넘어뜨리기. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that
they don’t provoke 기회 공격, you use your 시전자 레벨 in place
of your base 공격 보너스 (for 무장해제 and 드잡이), you use your 지능
modifier (if a 마법사) or 매력 modifier (if a 소서러) in place of your
근력 or 민첩 modifier, and a failed attempt doesn’t allow a reactive
attempt by the target (such as for 무장해제 or 넘어뜨리기). No save is allowed against
these attempts, but 주문 저항 applies normally. This version of the spell
can last 1 round per 시전자 레벨, but it ends if you cease 집중.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Violent
Thrust: </span><span>Alternatively,
the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or
creature per 시전자 레벨 (maximum 15) that are within 범위 and all within 10
feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per 레벨 of all the
objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per 시전자 레벨
(maximum 375 pounds at 15th 레벨).</span></p><p>You
must succeed on 명중 굴림 (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the
target with the items, using your base 공격 보너스 + your 지능
modifier (if a 마법사) or 매력 modifier (if a 소서러). 무기 cause
standard 피해 (with no 근력 bonus; note that arrows or 화살복제 deal 피해
as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause 피해
ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points
of 피해 per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).</p><p>Creatures
who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are
allowed Will 내성 굴림 (and 주문 저항) to negate the effect, as are those
whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is
hurled against a solid surface, it takes 피해 as if it had fallen 10 feet
(1d6 points).</p></section><section id="h3-2-telekinetic-sphere"><h3>염동력의 구</h3><div class="original-headline">Telekinetic Sphere</div><p>환기

medium 범위 (100 feet + 10 feet per 시전자 레벨) after the sphere has
succeeded in encapsulating its contents.</p><p>You
can 이동 objects or creatures in the sphere that weigh a total of 5,000 pounds
or less by concentrating on the sphere. You can begin moving a sphere in the
round after casting the spell. If you concentrate on doing so (a standard
action), you can 이동 the sphere as much as 30 feet in a round. If you cease
concentrating, the sphere does not 이동 in that round (if on a 레벨 surface)
or descends at its 낙하 rate (if aloft) until it reaches a 레벨 surface, or
the spell’s 지속시간 expires, or you begin concentrating again. If you cease
concentrating (voluntarily or due to failing a 집중 check), you can
resume concentrating on your next turn or any later turn during the spell’s
지속시간.</p><p>The
sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to
cause 피해 to the contents of the sphere.</p><p>You
can 이동 the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Material

No and Yes (object)</span></p><p>This
spell instantly 운송수단 you to a designated destination, which may be as
distant as 100 miles per 시전자 레벨. Interplanar travel is not possible. You
can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum
load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature
(carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below)
per three 시전자 레벨. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a
Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be
transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those
creatures must be in contact with you. As with all 주문 where the 범위 is
personal and the target is you, you need not make a 내성 굴림, nor is 주문 저항 applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another
person receive 내성 굴림 and 주문 저항.</p><p>You
must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The
clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of
strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even
impossible.</p><p>To
see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the 순간이동 table.
Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Familiarity:
</span><span>“Very
familiar” is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home.
“Studied carefully” is a place you know well, either because you can currently
see it, you’ve been there often, or you have used other means (such as <span style="font-style: italic;">염탐</span>)
to study the place for at least one hour. “Seen casually” is a place that you
have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed
once” is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic. </span></p><p>“False
destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to
an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so
completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a
false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than
rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or
even be off target from.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">On
Target: </span><span>You
appear where you want to be.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Off
Target: </span><span>You
appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random
direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be
traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Similar
Area: </span><span>You
wind up in an area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area.</span></p><p>Generally,
you appear in the closest similar place within 범위. If no such area exists
within the spell’s 범위, the spell simply fails instead.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Mishap:
</span><span>You and
anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 1d10
points of 피해, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For
these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the characters take
more 피해 and must reroll.</span></p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 34.5751em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Familiarity</td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; text-align: center; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">On Target</td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; text-align: center; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Off Target</td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; text-align: center; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Similar Area</td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; text-align: center; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Mishap</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">Very

brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human’s finger. Any creature
forced into or attempting to 이동 through a <span style="font-style: italic;">가시 장벽 </span>takes
slashing 피해 per round of 이동 equal to 25 minus the creature’s AC.
민첩 and 회피 bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures
with an 방어도 of 25 or higher, without considering 민첩 and 회피
bonuses, take no 피해 from contact with the wall.)</p><p>You
can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall
as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your 시전자 레벨. This
has no effect on the 피해 dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to
break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.</p><p>Creatures
can force their way slowly through the wall by making a 근력 check as a
full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature
이동 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land 속도). Of
course, moving or attempting to 이동 through the thorns incurs 피해 as
described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain
motionless in order to avoid taking any more 피해.</p><p>Any
creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes 피해 as if it had
moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt
