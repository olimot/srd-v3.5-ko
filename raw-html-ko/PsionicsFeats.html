are available only to characters and creatures with the ability to manifest
powers. (In other words, they either have a power point reserve or have
유사사이오닉 능력.)</p><p>Because 사이오닉 특기 are supernatural 능력—a departure from the general rule that 특기
do not grant supernatural 능력—they cannot be disrupted in 전투 (as
powers can be) and generally do not provoke 기회 공격 (except as
noted in their 묘사). Supernatural 능력 are not subject to 파워 저항 and cannot be dispelled; however, they do not function in 범위
where 사이오닉 is suppressed, such as a <span style="font-style: italic;">무의 사이오닉 장. </span>Leaving
such an 범위 immediately allows 사이오닉 특기 to be used.</p><p>Many 사이오닉 특기 can be used only when you are psionically focused; others require you to
expend your 사이오닉 집중 to gain their benefit. Expending your 사이오닉 집중
does not require an action; it is part of another action (such as using a
feat). When you expend your 사이오닉 집중, it applies only to the action for
which you expended it.</p><section id="h3-1-psionic-item-creation-feats"><h3>사이오닉 아이템 제작 특기</h3><div class="original-headline">PSIONIC ITEM CREATION FEATS</div><p>Manifesters can
use their personal power to create lasting 사이오닉 아이템. Doing so, however, is
draining. A manifester must put a little of himself or herself into every
psionic item he or she creates.</p><p>A psionic item
creation feat lets a manifester create a psionic item of a certain type.
Regardless of the type of items they involve, the various 아이템 제작 특기
all have certain features in common.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">XP Cost:</span><span> Power and energy that the manifester would normally keep is
expended when making a psionic item. The 경험치 비용 of using a
psionic item creation feat equals 1/25 the cost of the item in gold pieces. A
character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a 레벨.
However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new 레벨, he or she can
immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance
a 레벨.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Raw
Materials Cost:</span><span> Creating a psionic item requires
costly 구성요소, most of which are consumed in the process. The cost of these
materials equals 1/2 the cost of the item.</span></p><p>Using a psionic
item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or psionic workshop,
special tools, and other 장비. A character generally has access to what he
or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply (such as if he’s traveling far
from home).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Time:</span><span> The time to create a psionic item depends on the feat and the cost
of the item. The minimum time is one day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Item Cost:</span><span> 도르제 제작, 파워스톤 새기기, and 문신 새기기 create items that
directly reproduce the effects of powers, and the 근력 of these items
depends on their 구현자 레벨—that is, a power from such an item has the
근력 it would have if manifested by a manifester of that 레벨. Often, that
is the minimum 구현자 레벨 necessary to manifest the power. (Randomly
discovered items usually follow this rule.) However, when making such an item,
the item’s 근력 can be set higher than the minimum. Any time a character
creates an item using a power augmented by spending additional 파워 포인트,
the character’s effective 구현자 레벨 for the 목적 of calculating the
item’s cost increases by 1 for each 1 additional power point spent.
(Augmentation is a feature of many powers that allows the power to be amplified
in various ways if additional 파워 포인트 are spent.) All other
레벨-dependent parameters of the power forged into the item are set according
to the effective 구현자 레벨.</span></p><p>The price of
사이오닉 아이템 (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) depends
on the 레벨 of the power and a character’s 구현자 레벨. The character’s
구현자 레벨 must be high enough that the item creator can manifest the
power at the chosen 레벨. To find the final price in each case, multiply the character’s
구현자 레벨 by the power 레벨, then multiply the result by a constant, as
shown below.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">파워스톤: </span><span>Base price = power 레벨 x 구현자 레벨
x 25 gp</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">사이오닉 문신: </span><span>Base price = power 레벨 x 구현자 레벨 x 50 gp</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">도르제: </span><span>Base price = power 레벨 x 구현자 레벨 x 750 gp</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Extra Costs:</span><span> Any dorje, power stone, or psionic tattoo that stores a power with
an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. </span></p><p>For 사이오닉 문신 and 파워스톤, the creator must pay the XP cost when creating the
item. For a dorje, the creator must pay fifty times the XP cost. </p><p>Some 사이오닉 아이템 similarly incur extra costs in XP, as noted in their 묘사.</p></section><section id="h3-2-metapsionic-feats"><h3>메타사이오닉 특기</h3><div class="original-headline">METAPSIONIC FEATS</div><p>As a
manifester’s 지식 of 사이오닉 grows, he can learn to manifest powers in
ways slightly different from how the powers were originally designed or
learned. Of course, manifesting a power while using a metapsionic feat is more
expensive than manifesting the power normally.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">구현 시간:</span><span> Powers manifested using 메타사이오닉 특기
take the same time as manifesting the powers normally unless the feat
묘사 specifically says otherwise.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Manifestation
Cost:</span><span> To use a metapsionic feat, a psionic
character must both expend his 사이오닉 집중 (see the 집중 skill
묘사) and pay an increased power point cost as given in the feat
묘사.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Limits on
Use:</span><span> As with all powers, you cannot spend more
파워 포인트 on a power than your 구현자 레벨. 메타사이오닉 특기 merely
let you manifest powers in different ways; they do not let you violate this
rule. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Effects of
메타사이오닉 특기 on a Power:</span><span> In all ways, a
metapsionic power operates at its original power 레벨, even though it costs
additional 파워 포인트. The modifications to a power made by a metapsionic
feat have only their noted effect on the power. A manifester can’t use a
metapsionic feat to alter a power being cast from a power stone, dorje, or
other device.</span></p><p>Manifesting a
power modified by the 빠른 파워 feat does not provoke 기회 공격.</p><p>Some
메타사이오닉 특기 apply only to certain powers, as described in each specific
feat entry.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">사이오닉 아이템 and Metapsionic Powers:</span><span> With the right
psionic item creation feat, you can store a metapsionic power in a power stone,
psionic tattoo, or dorje. 레벨 limits for 사이오닉 문신 apply to the power’s
higher metapsionic 레벨. </span></p><p>A character
doesn’t need the appropriate metapsionic feat to activate an item in which a
metapsionic power is stored, but does need the metapsionic feat to create such
an item.</p></section><section id="h2-3-feat-descriptions"><h2>특기 설명</h2><div class="original-headline">FEAT DESCRIPTIONS</div><p>These 특기 설명 follow the standard format.</p><section id="h3-4-aligned-attack-psionic"><h3>성향 공격 [사이오닉]</h3><div class="original-headline">ALIGNED ATTACK [PSIONIC]</div><p>Your melee or

sometimes 바이패스 barriers.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your 사이오닉 집중. You can
attempt to manifest your powers against targets that are sheltered behind a
wall or force effect. Your power briefly skips through 영적 세계 to
바이패스 the barrier.</span></p><p>The 근력
and thickness of the barrier determine your chance of success. To successfully
바이패스 the barrier with your power, you make a 사이크래프트 check against a DC
equal to 10 + the hardness of the barrier + 1 per foot of thickness (minimum
1). Assign a hardness of 20 to barriers without a hardness rating, such as
force effects (or a <span style="font-style: italic;">심령의 벽</span>). Force 벽 or <span style="font-style: italic;">벽 of
ectoplasm </span>are assumed to have less than 1 foot of thickness unless noted
otherwise.</p><p>If a power
requires line of sight (which includes most powers that affect a target or
targets instead of an 범위), you cannot manifest it as a 파고드는 권능 unless
you can somehow see the target, such as with <span style="font-style: italic;">투시 감각</span>. Using
this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power’s total
cost cannot exceed your 구현자 레벨.</p></section><section id="h3-10-chain-power-metapsionic"><h3>사슬의 권능 [메타사이오닉]</h3><div class="original-headline">CHAIN POWER [METAPSIONIC]</div><p>You can
manifest powers that arc to hit other targets in addition to the primary
target. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your 사이오닉 집중. You can chain
any power that affects a single target and that deals either acid, cold,
electricity, fire, or sonic 피해. After the primary target is struck, the
power can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your 구현자 레벨
(maximum twenty). The secondary arcs each strike one target and deal half as
much 피해 as the primary one did (round down).</span></p><p>Each target
gets to make a 내성 굴림, if one is allowed by the power. You choose
secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the
primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to
affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in the 범위,
for example).</p><p>Using this feat
increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power’s total cost cannot
exceed your 구현자 레벨.</p></section><section id="h3-11-chaotic-mind-general"><h3>혼돈의 정신 [일반]</h3><div class="original-headline">CHAOTIC MIND [GENERAL]</div><p>The turbulence

takes one day. When you create a psionic tattoo, you set the 구현자 레벨.
The 구현자 레벨 must be sufficient to manifest the power in question and
no higher than your own 레벨. The base price of a psionic tattoo is its power
레벨 x its 구현자 레벨 x 50 gp. To scribe a tattoo, you must spend 1/25
of this base price in XP and use up raw materials (special inks, masterwork
needles, and so on) costing one-half of this base price.</span></p><p>When you create

공격 of opportunity, you can give up that 공격 and instead attempt to stop
your foe in his 추적. Make your 공격 of opportunity normally. If you hit
your foe, he must succeed on a Reflex save against a DC of 10 + your 피해
roll (the opponent does not actually take 피해), or immediately halt as if he
had used up his 이동 행동 for the round.</span></p><p>Since you use
the 부동 기립 feat in place of your 공격 of opportunity, you can do so only
a number of times per round equal to the number of times per round you could

a power. Manifesting a power altered by this feat causes the power to take
effect twice on the 범위 or target, as if you were simultaneously manifesting
the same power two times on the same location or target. Any variables in the
power (such as 지속시간, number of targets, and so on) are the same for both of
the resulting powers. The target experiences all the effects of both powers
individually and receives a 내성 굴림 (if applicable) for each. In some
cases, such as a twinned <span style="font-style: italic;">psionic charm</span>, failing both 내성 굴림
results in redundant effects (although, in this example, any ally of the target
would have to succeed on two dispel attempts to free the target from the charm
effect).</span></p><p>Using this feat

이동 행동 to traverse a wall or other relatively smooth vertical surface if
you begin and end your 이동 on a horizontal surface. The height you can achieve
on the wall is limited only by this 이동 restriction. If you do not end
your 이동 on a horizontal surface, you fall prone, taking 낙하 피해 as
appropriate for your distance above the ground. Treat the wall as a normal
floor for the 목적 of measuring your 이동. Passing from floor to wall or
wall to floor costs no 이동; you can change surfaces freely. Opponents on
the ground can make 기회 공격 as you 이동 up the wall.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Special:</span><span> You can take other 이동 행동 in conjunction with moving along a
wall. For instance, the 탄성 공격 feat allows you to make an 공격 from
the wall against a foe standing on the ground who is within the 범위 you
threaten; however, if you are somehow prevented from completing your 이동, you
fall. Likewise, you could 재주넘기 along the wall to avoid 기회 공격.</span></p></section><section id="h3-81-widen-power-metapsionic"><h3>파워 범위 연장 [메타사이오닉]</h3><div class="original-headline">WIDEN POWER [METAPSIONIC]</div><p>You can
