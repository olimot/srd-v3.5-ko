base 공격 보너스, and base save bonuses all remain the same. You retain all
supernatural and spell-like 특수 공격 and qualities of your normal form,
except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as
a mouth for a 브레스 무기 or eyes for a gaze 공격).</p><p>You
keep all extraordinary 특수 공격 and qualities derived from class 레벨,

구성요소.</p><p>You
acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind.
Physical qualities include natural size, mundane 이동 capabilities (such as
burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum
속도 of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying 이동), natural 갑옷
bonus, natural 무기 (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses,
racial bonus 특기, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of
wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not
allow you to make more 공격 (or more advantageous two-weapon 공격) than
normal.</p><p>You

blindsense, blindsight, 빠른 치료, 재생, 냄새, and so forth.</p><p>You
do not gain any supernatural 특수 공격, 특성, or spell-like

a template, even if that template doesn’t change the creature type or subtype.</p><p>You
can freely designate the new form’s minor physical qualities (such as hair
color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal 거리 for a creature of
that kind. The new form’s significant physical qualities (such as height,
weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the
norms for the new form’s kind. You are effectively disguised as an average
member of the new form’s race. If you use this spell to create a 변장, you
get a +10 bonus on your 변장 check.</p><p>When
the change occurs, your 장비, if any, either remains worn or held by the
new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the
new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to your true form, any
objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on
your body they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items
you wore in the assumed form and can’t wear in your normal form fall off and
land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body
part common to both forms at the time of reversion are still held in the same
way. Any part of the body or piece of 장비 that is separated from the
whole reverts to its true form.</p></section><section id="h3-9-analyze-dweomer"><h3>드웨머 분석</h3><div class="original-headline">Analyze Dweomer</div><p>점술</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">레벨:</span><span> Brd 6, Sor/Wiz 6</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">구성요소:</span><span> V, S, F</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">시전 시간:</span><span> 1

freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows you to project
an astral body onto another plane altogether.</p><p>You
can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that
these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting.
These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all
times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are
stranded wherever you left them.</p><p>You
project your astral self onto 영적 세계, leaving your physical body
behind on 물질 세계 in a state of suspended animation. The spell
projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto 영적 세계.
Since 영적 세계 touches upon other 이세계, you can travel astrally to
any of these other 이세계 as you will. To enter one, you leave 영적 세계, forming a new physical body (and 장비) on the plane of existence
you have chosen to enter.</p><p>While
you are on 영적 세계, your astral body is connected at all times to your
physical body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed,
astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord.
When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord
remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral
form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on 물질 세계, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation.
Although 유체 이탈 are able to function on 영적 세계, their
actions affect only creatures existing on 영적 세계; a physical body
must be materialized on other 이세계.</p><p>You
and your companions may travel through 영적 세계 indefinitely. Your
bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to
return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or
until it is terminated by some outside means, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">마법 무효화 </span>cast
upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver
cord, or the 파괴 of your body back on 물질 세계 (which kills
you).</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Material

spell removes the burden of evil acts or misdeeds from the subject. The
creature seeking 속죄 must be truly repentant and desirous of setting
right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly
or under some form of compulsion, <span style="font-style: italic;">속죄 </span>operates normally at no cost
to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and
acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your deity
(requiring you to expend 500 XP) in order to expunge the subject’s burden. Many
casters first assign a subject of this sort a quest (see <span style="font-style: italic;">기아스/임무</span>) or
similar penance to determine whether the creature is truly contrite before
casting the <span style="font-style: italic;">속죄 </span>spell on its behalf.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">속죄

may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing 성향 in order to offer
it a chance to change its 성향 to match yours. The prospective subject

the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original 성향 or
acquiesces to your offer and changes to your 성향. No duress, compulsion,
or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity
offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old 성향. This use of the spell
does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its 성향
naturally.</span></p><p>Though

the effect, since the 지속시간 overlap. If you do so, the target gets a 내성 굴림 at the end of the first spell’s 지속시간, even if your 시전자 레벨 was
high enough to disallow an initial 내성 굴림. If the creature succeeds on
this save, all the <span style="font-style: italic;">결속 </span>주문 it has received are broken.</p><p>The
<span style="font-style: italic;">결속 </span>spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions
when you cast the spell.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Chaining:
</span><span>The
subject is confined by restraints that generate an <span style="font-style: italic;">반감 부여 </span>spell
affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The 지속시간 is
one year per 시전자 레벨. The subject of this form of <span style="font-style: italic;">결속 </span>is
confined to the 감지 it occupied when it received the spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Slumber:
</span><span>This
version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per
시전자 레벨. The subject does not need to eat or drink while <span style="font-style: italic;">slumbering</span>,
nor does it 나이. This form of <span style="font-style: italic;">결속 </span>is more difficult to cast than <span style="font-style: italic;">chaining</span>,
making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell’s save DC by 1.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Bound
Slumber: </span><span>This
combination of <span style="font-style: italic;">chaining </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">slumber </span>lasts for as long as one
month per 시전자 레벨. Reduce the save DC by 2.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Hedged
Prison: </span><span>The
subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined 범위 from
which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save
DC by 3.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">변태:
</span><span>The
subject assumes 기체 형태, except for its head or face. It is held harmless
in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The
creature remains aware of its surroundings and can 말하기, but it cannot leave the
container, 공격, or use any of its powers or 능력. The <span style="font-style: italic;">결속 </span>is
permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while <span style="font-style: italic;">metamorphosed</span>,
nor does it 나이. Reduce the save DC by 4.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Minimus
Containment: </span><span>The
subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem,
jar, or similar object. The <span style="font-style: italic;">결속 </span>is permanent. The subject does not
need to breathe, eat, or drink while <span style="font-style: italic;">contained</span>, nor does it 나이. Reduce
the save DC by 4.</span></p><p>You
can’t dispel a <span style="font-style: italic;">결속 </span>spell with <span style="font-style: italic;">마법 무효화 </span>or a similar
effect, though an <span style="font-style: italic;">대마법 보호장 </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">마법사의 분열 </span>affects
it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane
due to <span style="font-style: italic;">차원 강제퇴거, 추방, </span>or a similar effect.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">구성요소:
</span><span>The
구성요소 for a <span style="font-style: italic;">결속 </span>spell vary according to the version of the
spell, but they always include a continuous chanting utterance read from the
scroll or spellbook page containing the spell, somatic gestures, and materials
appropriate to the form of <span style="font-style: italic;">결속 </span>used. These 구성요소 can include
such items as miniature chains of special metals, soporific herbs of the rarest
sort (for <span style="font-style: italic;">slumber </span>결속), a bell jar of the finest crystal, and the
like.</span></p><p>In
addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of <span style="font-style: italic;">결속 </span>(cost
500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the
target and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be
captured.</p></section><section id="h3-39-black-tentacles"><h3>검은 촉수</h3><div class="original-headline">Black Tentacles</div><p>창조술
