bit of time from the continuum, forming a 1-ounce dollop of thick, gooey
material called 정수. This substance shimmers like a silver mirror when
viewed from some angles but is transparent from other viewpoints. You can
smooth a dollop of 정수 around any extremely small object.</p><p>Objects sealed
within 정수 are protected from the effects of time; in practical terms,
they enter a state of stasis. Living flesh with only partial contact with
정수 is also partially pulled out of the time stream (the manifester is
immune to this effect). This disruption deals 1 point of 피해 per round
beginning 10 rounds after partial contact occurs.</p><p>정수
can be manually scraped away from a protected object, freeing it to rejoin the
time stream. When you do this, there is a 75% chance that the 정수
evaporates back into the continuum. Otherwise, it coalesces again into a
1-inch-diameter bead, available for later use.</p><p>Large
quantities of 정수 could theoretically be gathered to preserve large
items or structures (or even a complete living creature; if completely immersed,
a living creature would not take the 피해 associated with partial contact).
However, psionic characters and creatures are generally loath to do so because
accumulations of 정수 weighing 1 pound or more hinder psionic activity
within a 5-foot radius of the accumulation: Powers require twice as many 파워 포인트 to manifest, unless the manifester makes a successful Will save each
time he or she attempts to manifest a power. Also in these circumstances,
manifesting a psi-like ability that is usable at will is a full-round action
rather than a standard action.</p></section><section id="h3-2-read-thoughts"><h3>생각 읽기</h3><div class="original-headline">Read Thoughts</div><p>정신감응

사이언 power of 8th 레벨 or lower, provided the power is not prohibited to you.</p><p>• Duplicate any
other power (but not a spell) of 6th 레벨 or lower, such as a 사이킥 군인
power.</p><p>• Duplicate any
사이언 power of 7 레벨 or lower even if it’s a power prohibited to you.</p><p>• Undo the
harmful effects of many other powers, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">소우주, 기아스/임무, </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">광기</span>.</p><p>• Create a
nonpsionic item of up to 25,000 gp in value.</p><p>• Create a
psionic item, or add to the powers of an existing psionic item (see XP cost
below).</p><p>• Grant a
creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five <span style="font-style: italic;">현실 수정 </span>manifested in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to
+5 inherent bonus to an ability score. Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so
they cannot be negated or dispelled. An inherent bonus cannot exceed +5 for a
single ability score. Inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not
stack; only the best one applies.</p><p>• Remove
injuries and afflictions. A single <span style="font-style: italic;">현실 수정 </span>can 보조 one creature
per 구현자 레벨, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of
affliction. </p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">현실 수정 </span><span>can not restore the experience point loss
from manifesting a power or casting a spell, or the 레벨 or&nbsp; 건강
loss from being returned to life by those effects that reduce 레벨 or
건강.</span></p><p>• Revive the
죽음. <span style="font-style: italic;">현실 수정 </span>can bring a 죽음 creature back to life by
duplicating a <span style="font-style: italic;">부활 </span>spell. This power can revive a 죽음 creature
whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two manifestations of <span style="font-style: italic;">현실 수정</span>, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life
again. <span style="font-style: italic;">현실 수정 </span>cannot prevent a character who is brought back
to life from losing a 레벨.</p><p>• 운송수단
travelers. This power can lift one creature per 구현자 레벨 from anywhere
on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of
local 상태이상. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect,
and 파워 저항 (if any) applies.</p><p>• Undo
misfortune. <span style="font-style: italic;">현실 수정 </span>can undo a single recent event. Manifesting
the power forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including
your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. The
reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling
target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and 파워 저항 (if any)
applies.</p><p>You can try to
use <span style="font-style: italic;">현실 수정 </span>to produce more powerful effects than these, but
doing so is dangerous. The manifestation may pervert your intent into a literal
but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.</p><p>Duplicated
powers allow 내성 굴림 and 파워 저항 as normal (but save DCs are calculated
as though the power is 9th 레벨).</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">XP Cost: </span><span>The minimum XP cost for manifesting <span style="font-style: italic;">현실 수정 </span>is 5,000</span></p><p>XP. When a
manifestation duplicates a power that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or
that cost, whichever is more. When a manifestation creates or improves a
psionic item, you must pay twice the normal XP cost for crafting or improving
the item, plus an additional 5,000 XP.</p></section><section id="h3-4-recall-agony"><h3>고뇌 회상</h3><div class="original-headline">Recall Agony</div><p>초감각

브레스 무기 cannot pass through the wall in either direction (though they
could 피해 it). It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material creatures
(though ethereal creatures can usually get around the wall by floating under or
over it through material 바닥 and ceilings). The wall is opaque, so neither
